{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with clean finishes, LED lighting, marble-look wall panels, and updated appliances including washer and AC. The space appears well-maintained with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the low open TV cabinet shelves and floor-level LED strips may need attention, but no obvious hazards like exposed stairs or dangerous balconies are visible. The loft/mezzanine area in image 5 has a low sloped ceiling which may require careful baby-proofing."}
