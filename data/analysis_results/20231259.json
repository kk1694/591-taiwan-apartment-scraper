{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern loft-style apartment with high-quality finishes, light wood floors, recessed AC, and contemporary furniture. Major baby safety concern: steep open staircase to mezzanine level with no railing and the loft area has only minimal netting as a barrier - both are serious hazards for crawling/walking children. The balcony area has floor-to-ceiling glass with secure framing. Natural light is limited due to interior courtyard view facing concrete walls."}
