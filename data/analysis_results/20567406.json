{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Very high-end modern apartment with luxurious finishes including marble-pattern countertops, recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, leather sofas, and a large U-shaped kitchen with built-in appliances (microwave, gas stove, large refrigerator). The spacious open-plan living/dining area is immaculate and extremely clean. For baby safety, the highly polished tile floors could be slippery and the sharp corners on the marble kitchen island and dining table would need padding; no bedrooms or balconies were shown so railing safety cannot be assessed. At 52 ping on the 5th floor with no bedroom photos, confirm layout details and elevator availability with the agent — the listing description is minimal (agent promotional text only)."}
