{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment on 11th floor with dated fixtures including window AC units and traditional marble-trim flooring. The unit has good natural light and appears clean but unfurnished. For baby safety, the balcony visible from the kitchen area has metal railings that would need baby gates; no interior stairs but hard tile flooring throughout may be a concern for crawling/walking toddlers."}
