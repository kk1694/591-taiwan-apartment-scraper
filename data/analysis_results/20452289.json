{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Upscale, hotel-like apartment with high-end finishes including marble accents, hardwood floors, recessed lighting, and designer furniture. The open-plan layout features a living area, kitchen with modern appliances, and a workspace; large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light. For baby safety, the marble kitchen island has sharp corners that would need padding, and the floor-to-ceiling windows/balcony area should be checked for secure railings; the description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag — verify actual room count and lease terms directly."}
