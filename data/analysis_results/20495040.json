{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious modern high-rise apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, built-in wardrobes, and air conditioning. The building exterior shows a upscale complex near a pond/park area. For baby safety, the living room has a balcony with floor-to-ceiling glass railings which would need childproofing; the hard tile floors are easy to clean but would benefit from soft mats. Excellent natural light through large windows with mountain views; very clean and well-maintained throughout."}
