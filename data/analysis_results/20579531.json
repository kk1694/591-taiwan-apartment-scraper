{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with polished hardwood floors throughout, recessed lighting, large open living/dining area, built-in cabinetry, AC units, and a generously sized bedroom with large windows providing decent natural light. The marble coffee table has sharp corners and the hardwood floors could be slippery for a crawling baby, but the open layout is very family-friendly with plenty of room. At 2F with no elevator info visible, stairs may be a concern with a stroller; the listing is through Miller House agency and the description is minimal (just an ad for agent services), which is a minor red flag suggesting limited detail about the actual unit."}
