{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED cove lighting, wood-grain flooring throughout, split AC units, and upscale furniture. The spacious living room has a large sectional sofa and dining area; bedrooms are well-appointed with built-in shelving. Being on the top floor (7F/7F), there may be heat issues in summer and no confirmed elevator which is a concern with a baby and stroller. For baby safety, the space is generally clean with rounded furniture edges, but the low window sills and the stairs visible in the living area background are potential hazards that would need child-proofing. The description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), providing no useful details about the property."}
