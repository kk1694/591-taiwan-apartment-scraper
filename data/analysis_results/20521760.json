{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xingcheng Street, Datong District, near Shuanglian MRT (393m) and Minquan W. Road MRT (486m)", "notes": "Large 3BR/2BA unit on 10F/15F in an elevator building with gym and parking included. Move-in ready with appliances (fridge, washer, AC, water heater), furnished with bed/wardrobe/sofa, cooking allowed with natural gas, and pets permitted. Two balconies present — worth checking railing height and gaps for baby safety. High floor provides good natural light and views. Modernity uncertain without interior photos, but building amenities (gym, flat parking) suggest a relatively modern complex. Management fee of NT$4,200/month is additional. Excellent dual-MRT access is very convenient for a growing family."}
