{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, polished tile and hardwood flooring, modern kitchen with built-in appliances and large refrigerator, and wall-mounted AC units. The spacious open-plan living area has large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a balcony; the balcony railings appear to have narrow-spaced bars which is good for baby safety, but the sliding doors would need child locks. The bedroom is generously sized with good natural light and greenery visible outside. Overall very clean and well-maintained with minimal sharp corners, though the unit is mostly unfurnished so additional baby-proofing would be straightforward. At 45 ping in Xinyi on 2F of a 10-floor building, this is a high-quality modern unit likely in a newer building with elevator access."}
