{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and contemporary furniture. High floor (12F) with mountain views provides good natural light. The space is open and spacious with rounded furniture edges; the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors that would need childproofing, but overall the flat layout with no stairs is baby-friendly."}
