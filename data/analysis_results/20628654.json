{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Liuzhou Street, Wanhua District, near Ximen Carrefour, 135-176m from MRT stations", "notes": "Spacious 3BR/2BA on 12F of 22F elevator building on Liuzhou Street near Ximen. Move-in ready with furniture, appliances, natural gas cooking, balcony, and flat parking space included. NT$100K/month plus NT$4,125 management fee with 2-month deposit. Good for a family with baby: high floor provides safety, elevator access is essential, and proximity to MRT (within 176m) is convenient. However, pets are prohibited and the 1-balcony setup should be checked for railing safety. The description is sparse (agent placeholder text) so actual unit condition and modernity cannot be confirmed from photos — an in-person visit is strongly recommended. Minimum 1-year lease required."}
