{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment with double-height ceilings, contemporary furnishings including sectional sofa, massage chair, and piano. The interior staircase leading to a mezzanine level is a significant baby safety concern - stairs appear steep and lack visible baby gates. Kitchen is well-equipped with modern appliances. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling curtained windows, but being on top floor (7/7) with no elevator info visible is worth confirming."}
