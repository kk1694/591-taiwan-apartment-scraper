{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unit with modern industrial-style exposed conduit ceiling, new tile flooring, modern AC units in multiple rooms, and updated kitchen with gas stove and range hood. The space is completely empty/unfurnished with good natural light from large windows. Concerns: the exposed ceiling pipes may collect dust and are not baby-friendly; the unit appears to be designed for commercial/office use based on the industrial styling and open floor plan, though it could be converted to residential. No visible balcony hazards but floor-to-ceiling windows near balcony door need childproofing. Very clean condition."}
