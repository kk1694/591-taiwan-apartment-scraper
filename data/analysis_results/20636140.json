{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, newly renovated unfurnished apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, split AC units, and polished tile floors. The balcony has secure metal railings with narrow gaps which is relatively baby-safe, though the space is small. Good natural light from multiple windows; appears to be a 2-bedroom unit with open living/dining area. No visible safety concerns like exposed wires or sharp corners."}
