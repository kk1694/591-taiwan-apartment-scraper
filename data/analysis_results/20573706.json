{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with high-end modern finishes including LED cove lighting, wall-mounted TV with smart home panel, open-plan kitchen with marble backsplash, and minimalist built-in cabinetry throughout. The space is very clean with smooth rounded edges on furniture and no visible sharp corners, which is relatively baby-friendly; however, being on 3F of a 3F walk-up with no elevator would be challenging with a stroller and baby. Natural light is hard to assess as all photos are taken at night with curtains drawn, which is a minor concern worth verifying in person."}
