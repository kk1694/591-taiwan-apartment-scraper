{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu", "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with marble TV feature wall, recessed/track lighting, light wood-tone flooring, modern bathroom with bathtub and smart toilet. Spacious 45-ping layout with large open living area, good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with mountain/greenery views. For baby safety: the balcony has glass railings visible from the living room which would need a gate; the flat single-level layout with no stairs is ideal; bathroom has a bathtub which is convenient but would need supervision. The space is currently lived-in and cluttered but the underlying finishes and fixtures are high-end and in excellent condition. Building is 10 floors on 7F, almost certainly has an elevator."}
