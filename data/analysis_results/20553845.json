{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 45-ping Da'an apartment on 11F with hardwood floors and traditional dark wood furniture throughout; the unit is clean but dated with older-style cabinetry, glass display cases, wall-mounted AC units, and a cluttered storage room suggesting deferred maintenance. For baby safety, the glass-fronted display cabinets with sharp corners and heavy furniture are concerns, though the open floor plan and flat hardwood floors are positives; natural light appears limited with small windows relative to the large space, and the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag."}
