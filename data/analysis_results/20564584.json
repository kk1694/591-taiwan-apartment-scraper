{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Very modern, brand-new condition apartment on the 14th floor of a 24-story building with pristine polished tile floors, modern kitchen cabinetry with built-in appliances, and updated bathroom with gray tile. The unit is completely unfurnished and empty, extremely clean with excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling balcony windows. For baby safety, the balcony has ornamental iron railings with gaps that could be a concern for a crawling toddler and would need childproofing; the polished tile floors are very slippery which is a fall risk. No stairs visible — single-level layout is good for families. The unit appears to have at least 3 rooms plus kitchen and bathroom, offering generous space at 49 ping."}
