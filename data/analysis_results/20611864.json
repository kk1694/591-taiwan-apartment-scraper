{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with stylish exposed brick accent wall, modern laminate flooring, recessed lighting, and a spacious living/dining area with leather sofa and wooden dining set. Kitchen has an induction cooktop, range hood, and fridge. Two bedrooms with AC units and windows providing some natural light, though windows appear small. At 2F/5F with no elevator mentioned, this is a low walk-up which is manageable but still a concern with a stroller and baby gear. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent), so likely foreigner-friendly. No visible balcony hazards, but the second bedroom looks a bit cramped and dated compared to the rest of the unit."}
