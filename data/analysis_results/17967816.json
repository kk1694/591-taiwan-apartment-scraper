{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated wooden cabinetry and fixtures but well-maintained hardwood floors and clean white walls. The unit is spacious at 34 ping with multiple rooms visible off a hallway, good natural light from large windows, and wall-mounted AC units. For baby safety, the hardwood floors are slippery, corners on the built-in wooden cabinets are sharp, and the description is essentially blank (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a red flag suggesting minimal landlord engagement; no kitchen or bathroom photos were provided."}
