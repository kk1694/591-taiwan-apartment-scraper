{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District, Taipei", "notes": "Top floor (3F/3F) of a low-rise building, almost certainly no elevator which is a significant concern for carrying a baby and stroller up stairs. The listing description is empty (only contains agent advertising text), which is a red flag suggesting low-effort listing. At 34 ping the size is generous for a family, but without photos or a real description, condition, natural light, and baby safety features cannot be assessed. Recommend requesting photos and details before visiting."}
