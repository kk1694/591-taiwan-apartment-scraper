{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with upscale European-country style interior featuring custom wood wine storage cabinets, large white quartz kitchen island with bar seating, pendant lighting, and quality wood flooring throughout. The open-plan living/kitchen area is spacious and clean with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the open kitchen island with bar stools and hanging metal pot rack pose concerns; the dining room has a heavy solid-wood table with bench seating that has hard edges. Being on 2F of a 13-floor building strongly suggests elevator access. The description is minimal (agent placeholder text), which is a minor red flag — an in-person visit is recommended to verify room count, bedrooms, and bathroom condition."}
