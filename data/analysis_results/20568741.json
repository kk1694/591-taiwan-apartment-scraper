{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment in very clean condition with new wood-look laminate flooring, fresh paint, modern split AC units in multiple rooms, and a fully updated bathroom with glass-enclosed shower and marble-style tiles. The spacious living area has large sliding glass doors leading to a balcony with decent natural light. For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors and windows have metal railings/grilles which is positive, and the flat single-level layout with no stairs is ideal; however the unit is completely empty so furniture with corner guards would need to be sourced. The glass shower enclosure in the bathroom would need a child lock when the baby becomes mobile."}
