{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Modern loft-style duplex with high ceilings, stylish wood-look flooring, kitchen island, and contemporary fixtures throughout. Major baby safety concern: this is a split-level/loft unit with internal stairs leading to the mezzanine bedroom that have no visible railing or gate, and the mezzanine bedroom area appears to have an open edge with only glass panels or curtains — a serious fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access, and the unit is clean and well-maintained, but the loft layout makes it poorly suited for a family with a young child."}
