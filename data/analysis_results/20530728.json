{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern studio apartment with high-end finishes including built-in appliances, wine cooler, recessed LED lighting, and sleek cabinetry. The open floor plan with rounded furniture edges and no stairs is relatively baby-safe, though the glass balcony doors and low platform bed area would need attention. Good natural light from balcony windows; overall in excellent, clean condition with minimalist design."}
