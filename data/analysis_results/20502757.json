{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated bathroom fixtures (exposed pipes, old pedestal sink, basic tiles) and window AC units. The flooring is new laminate but walls show wear, and the overall style is 1990s Taiwan. For baby safety, the space is relatively open with no visible stairs, but the sliding door to balcony area and bathroom with slippery tiles need attention. Limited natural light through small frosted windows."}
