{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious apartment (~61 ping) managed by UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly rental agency). The unit is clean but dated with older-style fixtures, window-unit AC, basic light fixtures, and traditional iron security door. The living room is very large with comfortable sofas and good natural light from windows. Bedrooms are generously sized with built-in wardrobes and desks. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard and slippery, and the coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need padding; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — would need to confirm layout details and total room count directly with the agent."}
