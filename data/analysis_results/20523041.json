{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, split AC, white tile flooring, and a fully equipped open kitchen. The glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a baby safety concern, and the low glass shelving could be hazardous for a crawling toddler. Good natural light from multiple windows; spacious open-plan living and dining area at 38 ping is generous for a family, though the listing description is minimal (agent ad only) which is a minor red flag — worth confirming actual room count and lease terms directly."}
