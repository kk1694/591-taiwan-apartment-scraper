{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with pristine white tiles, recessed lighting, split AC units, and a sleek white kitchen with built-in microwave and range hood. The space is exceptionally clean with no visible hazards for a baby - no stairs, smooth flooring, and the balcony appears to have floor-to-ceiling glass doors with proper railings. Natural light is decent from the balcony area, though the unit appears compact as a studio-style layout."}
