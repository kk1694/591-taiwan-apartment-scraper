{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment in a typical Taiwanese walk-up building (4F/4F with no elevator visible). Interior shows dated fixtures with traditional wooden furniture, an older bathroom with aging tiles and bathtub, and some wall damage/peeling visible in the bedroom. Major baby safety concerns include internal stairs leading to an upper level with no visible safety gates, and the bathtub poses drowning hazards. Decent natural light from skylights in dining area and windows throughout, but overall condition is worn."}
