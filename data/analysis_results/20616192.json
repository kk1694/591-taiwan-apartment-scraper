{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated heavy wooden furniture throughout, including carved wooden sofa set, display cabinet, and traditional dining set. Has a Japanese-style tatami room with balcony access offering decent natural light. The unit is on 4F of an 18F building (likely has elevator), is clean and well-maintained despite the dated decor, and has hardwood flooring throughout. For baby safety: the balcony railings appear to have decorative openings that a small child could potentially reach through, the heavy wooden furniture has sharp corners on the coffee table and cabinet, and the tatami room's floor-level step-up could be a tripping hazard. The low balcony railing pattern is a concern for a crawling/toddling child."}
