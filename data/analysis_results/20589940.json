{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with high ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light, and clean white/neutral finishes throughout. At 32.63 ping with at least two bedrooms, it offers generous space for a family. The large sliding glass doors to the balcony and sharp-cornered glass coffee table are baby safety concerns that would need childproofing; the balcony railings appear to have horizontal bars which a toddler could potentially climb, so safety gates would be advisable."}
