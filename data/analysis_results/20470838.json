{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with designer lighting, minimalist furniture, and excellent natural light from large windows. The living space features a clean open layout with no visible stairs or hazardous sharp corners - generally baby-friendly, though the low round coffee table and floor-level decor would need baby-proofing. Kitchen has stainless steel countertops but exposed plumbing under the sink suggests some older building infrastructure behind the modern finishes."}
