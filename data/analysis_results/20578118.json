{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment with high-end finishes, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture. Major baby safety concern: the unit has internal stairs with minimal railings that could be dangerous for a crawling baby or toddler. The space is clean with good natural light from large windows, but the split-level design adds complexity for families with young children."}
