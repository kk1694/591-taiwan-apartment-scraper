{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with traditional wooden furniture, dated light fixtures, and older AC units. The space is clean and spacious with good natural light from large windows and a balcony. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, and the balcony sliding doors would need childproofing; no obvious stair hazards visible. Overall decent condition but furniture and fixtures are not modern."}
