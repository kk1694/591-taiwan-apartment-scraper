{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Charming but quirky renovated older building with European-style decor, white-painted wood floors, exposed beam ceilings, and a loft/mezzanine accessed by steep internal stairs — a major baby safety concern as the staircase has minimal railing and open sides. The low ceilings on the ground floor, narrow layout with a loft bed area, and internal stairs make this poorly suited for a couple with a baby; natural light appears limited to one window area, and the 1F location in an older 4-story walkup means no elevator."}
