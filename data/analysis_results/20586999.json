{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or nearly new modern apartment in a high-rise building (14F/21F), completely unfurnished with pristine white tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, wall-mounted AC units, and large black-framed windows. Excellent for baby safety — no stairs, no visible balcony access in photos, smooth floors with no sharp corners on built-in furniture, and all single-level living. The space is very clean and spacious at ~102 sqm with multiple rooms including what appears to be at least 2-3 bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and a desk area, though the unit will need all furniture including kitchen appliances. Note: the listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), so details about kitchen/bathroom are missing from the photos."}
