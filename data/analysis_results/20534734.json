{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very well-maintained, modern apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). Spacious living/dining area with polished tile floors, recessed and track lighting, large TV, and contemporary furniture; two bedrooms with wood-look flooring and ample natural light; hotel-quality bathroom with glass-enclosed shower and marble-style tiles. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the tiled living area floors are very slick; no dangerous balconies or stairs visible. Being on the 2nd floor of a 12-story building in Da'an district, it almost certainly has an elevator, and the overall condition is excellent and very clean."}
