{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern light wood cabinetry, recessed LED lighting throughout, new vinyl plank flooring, and a fully updated L-shaped kitchen with gas stove, range hood, and glass backsplash. The spacious open-plan layout is very clean and baby-friendly with no visible stairs, smooth flooring, and rounded cabinet edges; however, the open shelving units at low height may need baby-proofing. Large windows with iron grille security bars provide good natural light while also acting as safety barriers, though the listing description is essentially just an agent ad with minimal detail, which is a minor red flag."}
