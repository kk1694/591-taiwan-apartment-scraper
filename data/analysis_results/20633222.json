Clean condition with new fixtures, marble-look wall panels, modern kitchen appliances including washer. Baby safety concerns: the loft area (image 5) has a sloped ceiling and low windows that could pose risks; no visible railings on any upper level access. Good natural light through horizontal windows. Overall well-maintained and stylish."}
