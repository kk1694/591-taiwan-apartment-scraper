{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious apartment (~170 sqm) in Da'an district with light-colored wood/tile flooring, track lighting, and recessed ceiling details. The unit appears mostly empty/unfurnished with older-style built-in cabinetry, wall-mounted AC units, and dated door frames suggesting a renovated but not truly modern unit. Windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, but the large open floor plan with a round pillar and minimal furniture means few sharp-corner hazards; the 2F walkup without confirmed elevator could be inconvenient with a stroller. Natural light is decent from multiple windows, though the description is essentially blank (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — the listing feels like it may have been repurposed from a commercial or office use given the unusual open layout and sparse furnishing."}
