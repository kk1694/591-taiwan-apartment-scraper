{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with an all-white modern aesthetic, recessed LED ceiling lighting, light wood-tone flooring, and clean minimalist furniture. The living room is spacious with a large sofa, dining table, and what appears to be a baby high chair already present, suggesting family-friendliness. At least two bedrooms are visible with good natural light from large windows. The space appears very clean with no obvious sharp corners or dangerous features; the 6th floor of a 14-story building almost certainly has an elevator. No balcony is visible in the photos which is actually a safety plus for a baby, though the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only) so further details should be confirmed directly."}
