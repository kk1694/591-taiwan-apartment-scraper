{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with high-quality finishes including recessed lighting, built-in wood paneling, and new appliances. The unit has good natural light and includes a rooftop terrace and service balcony with gas water heater. Baby safety concerns: the rooftop terrace has low brick planters as barriers rather than tall railings, and the service balcony has widely-spaced metal bars that a child could potentially fit through - both areas would need restricted access for a baby."}
