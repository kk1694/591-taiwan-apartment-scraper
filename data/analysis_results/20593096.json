{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious luxury-styled apartment with European/classical decor including ornate furniture, crystal chandelier, and gold-trimmed moldings — well-maintained but dated in style rather than modern. The glass coffee table with sharp ornate corners is a baby safety concern; the bathtub lacks a non-slip mat. Good natural light from large windows in both living room and bedrooms, and the second bedroom could serve as a nursery. At 41 ping in Da'an district this is a generous family-sized unit, but the 5th floor with unknown elevator status in what appears to be an older building may be inconvenient with a stroller."}
