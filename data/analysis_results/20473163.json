{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in ceiling AC, and a newer building exterior visible through large sliding glass balcony doors. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony sliding doors should be secured with child locks once the baby is mobile. Good natural light from the large balcony windows; the unit appears very clean and well-maintained with a separate kitchen area visible in the back."}
