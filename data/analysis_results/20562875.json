{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale but dated European-baroque style apartment with ornate gilded furniture, decorative mirrored glass partitions, and heavy curtains. At 48 ping in Da'an on the 8th floor of a 14-story building, it likely has an elevator. For baby safety, the ornate furniture has many sharp carved edges and corners, the decorative glass partition is a breakage risk, and the treadmill in one room poses a hazard for a crawling child. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a red flag suggesting minimal transparency about the property."}
