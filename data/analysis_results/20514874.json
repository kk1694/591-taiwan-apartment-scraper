{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment in Shilin with clean white walls, light wood finishes, AC, large TV, and built-in wardrobes. The building appears relatively new (modern facade with balconies) and at 15 floors will have an elevator. Being on the top floor (15F/15F) is a concern for potential roof leaks and heat; the balcony has metal railings that appear safe but the living room window opens to a balcony that would need baby-proofing. The apartment is clean with good natural light from windows, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad with no real property details), which is a minor red flag."}
