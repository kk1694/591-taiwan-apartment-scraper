{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern white finishes, light wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, and a sleek L-shaped kitchen with induction cooktop. The unit is a loft-style duplex with an internal staircase and metal railings leading to an upper mezzanine level, which is a significant baby safety concern — the open staircase with thin metal railings and gaps would require child gates and additional barriers. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide good natural light, but the decorative vertical slat room dividers also have wide gaps that a small child could reach through. Overall very clean and move-in ready, but the two-level layout with exposed stairs makes it less ideal for a family with a baby."}
