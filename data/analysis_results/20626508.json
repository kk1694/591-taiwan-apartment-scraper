{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and modern apartment in Da'an with clean white tile flooring, recessed lighting, built-in wardrobes, and a well-renovated living area with marble-look accent wall. The unit appears to be on the 7th of 8 floors with an intercom/video entry system suggesting elevator access. For baby safety, the tile floors are slippery, windows in bedrooms appear to have limited guards, and the loft-style children's bed in the pink room has railings but could be a climbing hazard; natural light is moderate with relatively small windows facing other buildings."}
