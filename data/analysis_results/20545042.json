{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with fresh white walls, new furniture, and updated kitchen with gas stove and modern cabinetry. The unit has two bedrooms with good natural light through large windows with curtains, and an intercom system visible on the wall. For baby safety, the windows appear to have security bars/railings which is positive, and the flat tile floors are easy to clean; however, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the kitchen is narrow with accessible stove knobs that should be child-proofed. At 32 ping on the 2nd floor of a 9-story building (likely has elevator), this is a spacious and well-maintained unit at a reasonable price for Neihu."}
