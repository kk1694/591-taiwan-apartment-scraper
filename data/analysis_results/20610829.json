{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with bright white walls, light wood-tone flooring, modern kitchen with Panasonic fridge, dishwasher, microwave, and gas stove. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with mountain views. Being on 5F/5F with no elevator is a significant concern for a couple with a baby (carrying stroller up 5 flights); the large open windows near the floor may need child-proofing, but overall the flat open layout with no stairs inside and smooth flooring is baby-friendly. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agent)."}
