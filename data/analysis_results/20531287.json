{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Very spacious duplex unit (13F/14F) with marble-style tile flooring, high ceilings, and abundant natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with city/mountain views. The unit is unfurnished and appears clean but dated with older-style fixtures, crown molding, and dark marble baseboards typical of 1990s-era Taiwanese construction. Major baby safety concerns include an internal staircase connecting the two floors with no visible baby gate, a large open balcony/terrace accessible through sliding doors, and slippery polished tile floors throughout. The hard tile surfaces and sharp marble trim edges would need childproofing."}
