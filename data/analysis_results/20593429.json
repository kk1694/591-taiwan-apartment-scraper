Very clean condition with minimal furnishings. For baby safety: the bedroom shows a small balcony with decorative iron railings that appear adequately spaced but would need childproofing; the glass coffee table has sharp corners. No stairs visible in this single-floor unit on the 15th floor of an 18-story building."}
