{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei 101, Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with clean minimalist renovation, track lighting, and split AC units. The balcony has a view of Taipei 101 with metal railings at reasonable height - would need baby-proofing as the railing gaps could be a concern. Excellent natural light from large windows with balcony access. The open floor plan has no visible stairs but balcony access requires supervision with a crawling/walking child."}
