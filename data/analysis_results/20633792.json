{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with traditional wooden beam ceilings, window AC units, and vintage furniture. The balcony has a low wooden lattice fence that would need securing for baby safety. Overall clean condition with decent natural light from large sliding doors, but the space has dated fixtures and some wall patches visible suggesting maintenance needs."}
