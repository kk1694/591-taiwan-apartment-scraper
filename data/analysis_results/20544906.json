{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a large, renovated space with modern recessed lighting, AC units, and new flooring, but it has characteristics suggesting commercial or studio use rather than residential - full-wall mirrors typical of dance studios, completely empty with no kitchen or bathroom visible, and two separate entry doors. For a family with baby, the large mirrors pose a safety hazard, and the space lacks essential residential amenities. Natural light is decent from balcony windows but limited in some areas."}
