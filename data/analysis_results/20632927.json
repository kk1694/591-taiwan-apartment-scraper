{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated studio apartment with minimalist white design, LED accent lighting, and contemporary fixtures. The open layout with glass coffee table and low partition between bedroom and living areas may require baby-proofing. Excellent condition and cleanliness; being on floor 14 of 19 strongly suggests elevator access. Good natural light from balcony windows, though no separate bedroom makes it more suitable as a studio for a small family."}
