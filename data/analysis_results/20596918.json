{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment with open staircase leading to upper mezzanine level - the stairs have no railings which is a significant baby safety hazard. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. Clean condition with modern kitchen, AC, and updated appliances, but the open staircase design makes this unsuitable for families with young children."}
