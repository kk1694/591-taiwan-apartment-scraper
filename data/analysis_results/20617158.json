{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei 101, Xinyi District", "notes": "Modern high-rise building with marble lobby and elevator, located very close to Taipei 101 with stunning nighttime views. The interior appears to be a loft-style duplex with stairs visible in the last image, which is a significant baby safety concern — the open staircase with low wooden railings would need baby gates. The unit looks clean and well-maintained with built-in cabinetry and a sofa, though only one interior photo is provided so full condition is hard to assess. The listing description is minimal (just an agent promotion), which is a minor red flag — request more interior photos before visiting."}
