{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern and stylish open-plan studio apartment on the 14th floor of a 19-story building with high-end finishes including glossy white cabinetry, walnut sliding panels, crystal chandelier, built-in TV unit, and a sleek kitchenette with induction cooktop. The balcony has a washing machine and appears to have proper railings with a decorative lattice pattern, though being on a high floor the balcony access via large glass sliding doors is a concern for a crawling baby. The unit is essentially one open room combining bedroom, living, and kitchen areas — no separate rooms for baby, and the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from soft mats for child safety."}
