{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment on a high floor (14F) with modern fixtures including recessed lighting, built-in AC, and updated kitchen cabinetry. Good natural light from windows with city views. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need protection, and exposed cords/appliances in the kitchen area should be secured. Overall clean condition but some wall marks visible near the kitchen area."}
