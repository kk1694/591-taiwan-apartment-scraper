{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "This space has an industrial/loft aesthetic with exposed ceiling pipes, track lighting, and high ceilings, giving it a somewhat commercial or converted-office feel rather than a typical residential apartment — the layout is unclear and may not be a standard flat. The unit is spacious and clean with laminate flooring, basic furnishings (red sofa, dining table, small kitchen with sink but no visible stove or full cooking setup), AC, and sliding glass doors to what appears to be a balcony. For baby safety, the sliding glass balcony doors on the 12th floor are a concern, the kitchen area lacks a proper cooking setup, and the minimal/sparse furnishing suggests this may be better suited as an office or studio space rather than a family home."}
