{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with high ceilings, recessed lighting, and contemporary finishes. Good natural light from large windows with balcony access. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the balcony door requires child locks; overall layout is open and spacious which is good for a growing family."}
