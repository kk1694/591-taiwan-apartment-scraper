{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern studio-style apartment with stylish finishes including designer feature wall, recessed lighting, and quality wood flooring. Very clean condition with split AC and modern furniture. Being on 7F/7F with no elevator confirmation is a concern for a family with baby; the open-plan layout and balcony door visible in image 3 should be baby-proofed. Limited natural light from small windows."}
