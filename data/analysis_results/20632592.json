{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang", "notes": "Spacious, modern luxury apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, glass partitions, dark wood cabinetry, and a large leather sectional sofa. The master bedroom already has a baby crib and colorful play mat, indicating it is baby-friendly; the living room has smooth tile floors with no stairs but the glass partition edges could pose a minor bump hazard for a toddler. The bathroom is modern with separate shower enclosure, natural window light, and clean fixtures. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), 15-story building on 5F strongly suggests elevator access, and overall the apartment is very clean with good natural light — an excellent option for a couple with a baby."}
