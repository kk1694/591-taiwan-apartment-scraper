{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated parquet flooring and window AC units. Spacious layout with large living area and balcony, but walls show some wear and ceiling has water stains visible in some rooms. For baby safety: balcony access through sliding doors needs childproofing, but no dangerous stairs visible. Being on 5F/5F (top floor) in a likely older building without confirmed elevator would be challenging with a stroller."}
