{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wenshan District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment in excellent condition with high-end finishes including track lighting, open-concept kitchen with island, large Japanese-style refrigerator, built-in wardrobes, and modern glass-enclosed bathroom. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency). The living room has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a balcony with adequate railings; the open shelving unit in the living room could be a tipping hazard for a toddler and would need securing. The polished tile floors throughout are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby. Good natural light from large windows. At 45 ping on the 5th floor of a 12-story building, an elevator is very likely. Overall a high-quality, well-maintained family apartment but the open kitchen layout means baby gates would be needed around the cooking area."}
