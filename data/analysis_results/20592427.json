{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with stylish wooden beam ceiling accents, marble feature wall, recessed lighting, and quality wood-tone flooring throughout. The open-plan kitchen has a nice bar-counter dining area with pendant lights. The balcony has metal railings with gaps that could be a safety concern for a crawling baby and would need childproofing; the high bar stools at the kitchen counter are also a tipping hazard. Good natural light from large windows with greenery visible outside; the 2F location in a 5-story walk-up likely means no elevator, which could be challenging with a stroller."}
