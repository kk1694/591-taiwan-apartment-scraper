{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Minzu East Road, Songshan District, 220m from Songshan Airport MRT Station Exit 2", "notes": "Spacious 3BR/2BA entire-floor apartment (45.24 ping) with elevator, parking space included, and cooking allowed. Near Songshan Airport MRT station. The listing description is minimal (appears to be a promotional/agent placeholder text), so interior condition and modernity cannot be confirmed — no detailed photos or condition description available. For a couple expecting a baby, note the balcony (check railing height/gaps), the 2F location is convenient but verify window/balcony safety; no-pets policy is fine but confirm landlord flexibility on baby-related modifications. Management fee of NT$3,500/month is additional cost on top of the NT$75,000 rent."}
