{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious well-maintained apartment with dark hardwood floors, recessed lighting, and central AC, but the furnishings and finishes appear dated (older-style leather sofas, wood paneling, glass coffee table with sharp corners). The balcony has a lattice-style railing visible in image 2 which could be a climbing hazard for a toddler; the glass coffee table corners are also a baby safety concern. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room, and the apartment is clean and managed by Dingli Rental Service (a reputable agency often serving expats), though the description is essentially empty which is a minor red flag."}
