{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment in Da'an with modern white kitchen featuring an island counter, glass backsplash, recessed lighting, and clean tile flooring throughout. The open-plan living/dining/kitchen area is spacious and bright with a large TV, comfortable sofa, and dining set. For baby safety, the kitchen island has sharp corners that would need padding, and the tile floors are hard but smooth; no dangerous balcony railings or stairs are visible. Being on the top floor (7F/7F) with no elevator info is a concern — older 7-story buildings in Taiwan typically lack elevators, which would be very difficult with a stroller and baby."}
