{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with high-end finishes including marble accents, recessed lighting, wood laminate flooring, and a large mirror wall feature. The space is clean and unfurnished with good natural light through large windows. For baby safety, the hard tile/stone flooring in the entryway and sharp corners on the floating shelf and mirrored walls would need childproofing; no stairs visible but windows appear to have secure frames."}
