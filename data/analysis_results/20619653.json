{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, and floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. The open layout is relatively baby-safe with no visible stairs, though the glass coffee table and balcony sliding doors would need childproofing. The unit appears very clean and well-maintained in a newer high-rise building."}
