{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated studio/1-room apartment with stylish mint accent wall, light wood flooring, digital door lock, induction cooktop, open kitchen with bar seating, and glass-enclosed bathroom. The building appears to be a newer high-rise (5F/9F) in Zhongshan and almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows have no visible balcony which is good, but the bar stools and low coffee table with sharp edges would need childproofing; the open layout with smooth floors is generally baby-friendly. Natural light is decent from the large windows though views face an adjacent building closely; overall very clean and well-maintained but at 16.67 ping it may feel tight for a couple with a baby, and no separate bedroom is visible in the photos."}
