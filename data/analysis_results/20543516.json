{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern studio apartment with white minimalist decor, good natural light from large windows, and modern appliances including washing machine, microwave, and AC. The glass coffee table has sharp edges that would need childproofing, and the open kitchenette layout lacks barriers which may require baby-proofing once the child becomes mobile. Overall the space is well-maintained but quite compact for a family with a baby."}
