{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with hardwood floors throughout, upholstered headboard wall in master bedroom, glass-enclosed shower bathroom, and a second bedroom/study with built-in closet and desk. The space is clean and in good condition with recessed lighting and AC units. Being on 1F is convenient for a couple with a baby (no stairs to navigate), though natural light appears limited with mostly frosted or small windows; the flat layout with no visible stairs and rounded furniture edges is relatively baby-safe, but the glass shower door and open shelf in the second room would need attention."}
