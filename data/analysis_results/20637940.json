{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious but dated apartment with older fixtures and furnishings from likely the 1990s-2000s era. The living room has leather sofas and hardwood floors in good condition, with a balcony that has metal railings (potential baby safety concern). The kitchen appears functional but dated with white tile and older cabinets. Good natural light from balcony windows, overall clean but not recently renovated."}
