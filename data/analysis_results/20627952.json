{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with light wood laminate flooring, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and ceiling-mounted AC. The unit is clean and spacious at ~31 ping with good natural light from large windows; no visible balcony hazards, no stairs, and rounded/minimal corners make it relatively baby-safe. Red flag: the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), and the unit is completely unfurnished, so you would need to budget for all furniture and appliances."}
