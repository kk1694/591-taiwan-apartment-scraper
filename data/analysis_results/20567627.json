{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylishly renovated apartment with high-end finishes including wood-paneled ceiling, open kitchen with bar seating, and contemporary fixtures. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. For baby safety: the elevated platform area with steps could be a concern, and the balcony railings should be verified for child safety. The space appears clean and well-maintained."}
