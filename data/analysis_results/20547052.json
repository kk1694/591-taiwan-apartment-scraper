{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern white glossy kitchen cabinets, LED backlighting, induction cooktop, new refrigerator, and light wood-tone laminate flooring throughout. The space is very clean and minimalist with recessed lighting and an AC unit. For baby safety, there is a floor-level step-down at the entryway that could be a tripping hazard, and the balcony has a full-height glass sliding door that should be kept locked; the decorative vertical wood slat room divider has gaps a child could reach through. Natural light appears limited based on the nighttime photos, but there are large windows and a balcony door suggesting decent daytime light. At 25.5 ping on the 2nd floor of a 14-story building, an elevator is very likely present."}
