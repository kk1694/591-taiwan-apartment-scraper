{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "This listing appears to be a realtor advertisement rather than a detailed property listing, as the description only contains a promotional message about agent pricing packages. At 32 ping on the 8th floor of a 15-story building, it is likely a standard residential apartment. Without photos or a detailed description, it is impossible to assess baby safety features, natural light, condition, or whether the building has an elevator, though mid-rise buildings of this size in Zhongzheng typically do."}
