{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern built-in kitchen cabinetry, glass backsplash, central AC, ceiling fans, and clean large-format tile flooring. The open-plan layout is spacious with a white sectional sofa, built-in TV unit, and wardrobe; the flat single-level floor and lack of visible stairs are good for baby safety, though the open kitchen layout means oven/stove access would need childproofing. Being on the top floor (3F/3F) with no elevator confirmed is a concern for carrying a stroller and baby, and the description is essentially just an agent ad with no real details about the property."}
