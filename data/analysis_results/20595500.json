{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment in excellent condition with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, and contemporary fixtures. The unit has good natural light through floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. For baby safety, note the glass coffee table with sharp edges and the balcony sliding doors that will need childproofing; otherwise the flat layout with no stairs is favorable for a family with an infant."}
