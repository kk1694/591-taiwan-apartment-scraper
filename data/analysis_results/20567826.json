{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "This is clearly an office space, not a residential apartment. The rooms are furnished with office desks, rolling office chairs, filing cabinets, and fluorescent drop-ceiling lighting typical of commercial use. There is no kitchen, bedroom furniture, or residential amenities visible. The balcony has glass railings with a city view from the 8th floor. Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby as it lacks any residential setup, and the office furniture with rolling chairs and sharp desk corners would pose safety hazards."}
