{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with light wood flooring, recessed and accent LED lighting, open-plan living/dining/kitchen layout, modern white kitchen with island counter, and minimalist furnishings. The space is very clean with no visible sharp corners or hazards; the flat single-level layout with no stairs is excellent for baby safety. Natural light comes from windows in the living area though they appear modest in size. At 22.57 ping on the 6th floor of a 14-story building (almost certainly has an elevator), this is a high-quality, move-in ready unit, though the description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder) which is a minor red flag — request full details directly."}
