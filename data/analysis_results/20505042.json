{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and clean apartment with fresh white walls, sleek marble-pattern floor tiles, modern sofa, split AC, and large sliding glass doors to a balcony with vertical railing slats. At 11F/12F, the building almost certainly has an elevator. The balcony has railings visible through the glass but the spacing of the vertical slats should be checked for baby safety; the coffee table has sharp metal edges that would need corner guards. Only 2 images available showing the living room, so kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom condition are unknown — the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag."}
