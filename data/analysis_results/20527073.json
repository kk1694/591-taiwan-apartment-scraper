{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an, near elevated highway/expressway and large park area", "notes": "Spacious, clean, and modern apartment on 8F/12F with bright white tile flooring, recessed lighting, split AC, and a well-furnished living room with L-shaped sofa and built-in TV cabinet. The view overlooks a large green park area and an elevated expressway, which may generate traffic noise. For baby safety, the tile floors are slippery and the coffee table has sharp corners; the entryway has a raised step/platform that could be a tripping hazard. No visible balcony in these photos, but the windows appear secure. Overall very clean and well-maintained with good natural light."}
