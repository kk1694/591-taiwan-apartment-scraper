{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with pristine white tile floors, modern AC units, recessed lighting, and clean walls. Spacious open layout with multiple rooms including a furnished bedroom. For baby safety, the hard tile floors may need area rugs, and no concerning stairs or balconies visible in photos; however, flooring is very slippery-looking which could be a concern for crawling/walking baby. Overall very clean and move-in ready condition with good natural light from multiple windows."}
