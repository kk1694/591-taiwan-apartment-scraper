{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Images show only common areas (luxury lobby with gold sculptures, staffed reception desk, landscaped garden) and building exterior - no interior apartment photos provided. The building is clearly modern and upscale with concierge service, suggesting elevator access. However, cannot assess actual unit condition, layout, natural light, or baby safety features without interior photos. At 45 ping in Da'an for NT$80k, this appears to be a high-end building, but the listing is suspicious as it only showcases amenities rather than the rental unit itself."}
