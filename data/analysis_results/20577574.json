{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "The listing description is essentially empty, containing only a generic promotional message for the real estate agent platform rather than any property details. At 19 ping on the 5th floor of a 15-story building, it is likely a standard apartment with elevator access, but this cannot be confirmed. Without images or meaningful description, it is impossible to assess condition, baby safety features, natural light, or cleanliness — this listing is a red flag due to lack of information and the NT$40,000 price for Wanhua district seems high for an undescribed unit."}
