{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with custom wood-panel built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, and quality laminate flooring throughout. The kitchen has modern stainless-steel counters, gas stove, range hood, and a back door leading to a small service balcony. Bathroom features glass-enclosed shower and modern vanity. For baby safety, the living room has some sharp corners on the TV console and low furniture, and the kitchen door to the balcony area would need childproofing; the glass shower partition in the bathroom is also a concern. Good natural light from large windows, and at 36.4 ping on the 5th floor of a 23-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator. The listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text), which is a minor red flag — verify actual room count and lease terms directly."}
