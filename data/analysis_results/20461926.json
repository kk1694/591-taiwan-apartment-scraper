{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Very high-end modern studio/1-room apartment with luxury finishes including built-in oven, sleek kitchen island, recessed lighting, dark wood flooring, and designer furniture. The unit is on 8F/14F in what appears to be a modern high-rise with elevator (digital intercom and electronic door lock visible). For baby safety, the open-plan layout with a raised bed platform could be a tripping hazard, the glass partition near the bed area and the kitchen island bar stools with sharp metal frames are concerns. Natural light appears limited with frosted glass block windows in the kitchen; the overall space is clean and well-maintained but at 24 ping it is essentially a luxury studio that may feel tight for a couple with a baby."}
