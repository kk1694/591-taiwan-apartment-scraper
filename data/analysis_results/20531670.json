{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained modern apartment with stylish marble TV feature wall, recessed lighting, light wood laminate flooring, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. The living room is very clean with a comfortable L-shaped sofa and open layout. For baby safety, the large windows have metal grid railings which is positive, but the decorative brick wall and marble edges near the TV console could pose bump hazards for a crawling toddler; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony gaps. At 35 ping on the 3rd floor of an 11-story building, it likely has an elevator, and the generous size is great for a growing family."}
