{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment (39 ping) in clean condition with tile flooring in the living area and hardwood parquet in bedrooms; the decor is dated with ornate wood-beam ceilings, glass block partitions, wood-paneled accent walls, and window-unit AC. Balcony has security bars/railings which are good for baby safety, but the living room has many open shelving cubbies at low height that a crawling baby could reach; the 2F walkup with no elevator would be manageable but inconvenient with a stroller. Natural light appears limited based on the photos, and the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag."}
