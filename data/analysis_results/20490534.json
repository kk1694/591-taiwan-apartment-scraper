{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Very spacious 63-ping unfurnished apartment on the top floor (16F) with large open living areas, light wood flooring, and decent natural light from windows. The kitchen has older-style cabinetry and dated tile work but is functional with gas stove, range hood, and ample storage. For baby safety, the raised platform/step between living areas is a tripping hazard, and the low brick half-wall near the windows needs childproofing; being the top floor may mean heat issues in summer. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agent), the unit is clean but not modernized — fixtures, AC units, and kitchen appliances appear to be from the 1990s-2000s era."}
