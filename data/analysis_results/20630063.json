{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated open-plan apartment on the top floor (14F) with designer bohemian-rustic styling, excellent natural light from large windows, track lighting, and high-quality wood flooring. The raised living area platform near the windows is a baby safety concern as a toddler could fall from the step; the open shelving ladder and many hanging plants with pots at reachable heights also pose risks. The space appears to be a large studio/1-bedroom with the bedroom separated only by a glass partition, which is very clean and well-maintained but the open layout and decorative elements would require significant baby-proofing."}
