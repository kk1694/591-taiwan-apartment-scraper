{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large 75-ping apartment in a 14-floor building in Shilin with dated but well-maintained interiors — older-style leather sofas, recessed ceiling lighting with yellow accent strips, and marble/terrazzo floors throughout. The spacious living and dining areas offer good natural light from large sliding windows with balcony access; the kitchen is a galley-style with older white tile and basic appliances. For baby safety, the hard marble floors and sharp-cornered coffee table/dining furniture are concerns, and the balcony sliding doors would need childproofing; however the flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request a viewing to verify actual condition and layout details."}
