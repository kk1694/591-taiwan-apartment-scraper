{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/office space rather than a residential apartment - it has drop ceiling with fluorescent panel lighting, industrial HVAC vents, and completely empty open floor plan typical of office spaces. While clean and modern, it lacks any residential features like kitchen or proper bedroom partitions. The balcony has standard railings but the overall commercial nature makes this unsuitable for a family with a baby."}
