{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern light-wood Scandinavian-style furniture, wood-laminate flooring, wall-mounted AC, large flat-screen TV, and clean white walls. The space has good natural light from large sliding glass doors leading to a small balcony with greenery views. For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors would need a child lock, and the low open cubby shelving near the entrance could pose a tipping hazard; the coffee table has rounded edges which is positive. No elevator information is available from images — at 3F/5F in a smaller building it likely has no elevator, which would be inconvenient with a stroller."}
