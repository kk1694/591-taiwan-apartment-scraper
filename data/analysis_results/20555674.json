{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large, spacious apartment with dated 1990s-style decor including marble flooring, dark wood trim, and window-unit AC. The unit is very clean and well-maintained with excellent natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the open floor plan with hard marble floors may require area rugs, and the elevated threshold near the doorway could be a tripping hazard; no visible balcony railings or stairs of concern."}
