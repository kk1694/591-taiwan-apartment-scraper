{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern marble-look tile flooring, recessed lighting, marble accent TV wall, and a well-equipped galley kitchen with Sharp refrigerator, gas stovetop, and ample cabinetry. The unit appears very clean with a raised platform sleeping area and split AC. For baby safety, the sliding glass balcony door and the raised bedroom platform with sharp marble edges are concerns; the kitchen is narrow but has a door that could be gated. Being on 1F is convenient for stroller access but may limit natural light and ventilation. The listing description is minimal (just a promotional ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and lease terms."}
