{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment (46 ping) with hardwood floors, at least 3 bedrooms, and a clean bathroom with wet/dry separation. Furniture and fixtures are dated (90s-2000s era wood cabinets, old-style leather sofas, CRT-era TV stand) but the unit is well-maintained and clean. Good natural light from multiple windows in every room; the 8th floor elevation in a 17-story building strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners in the living room is a concern, and the bathroom has a slippery tile floor with no bathtub — but no dangerous balcony access or open staircases are visible. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — ask for full details on layout and lease terms."}
