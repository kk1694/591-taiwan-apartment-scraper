{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, AC units, and clean tile flooring throughout. The unit appears well-maintained with multiple rooms and a clean kitchen with washing machine and gas stove. For baby safety, the floors are hard tile which could be slippery, and the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need childproofing; windows appear to have secure frames. Good natural light from multiple windows in living areas and bedrooms."}
