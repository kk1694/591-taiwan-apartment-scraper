{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious, high-end modern apartment with designer finishes including green marble kitchen island, recessed LED lighting, floor-to-ceiling windows, and premium appliances (Panasonic washer/dryer). Very clean and spacious with open-plan living. For baby safety: the kitchen island has sharp corners that may need corner guards, and the floor-to-ceiling windows appear secure; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings. Excellent natural light from large windows. Being on 10F of a 10-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
