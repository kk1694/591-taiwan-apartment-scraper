{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Very modern and well-maintained apartment in a newer high-rise building (3F/19F strongly suggests elevator). The unit features contemporary finishes including wood-grain laminate flooring, modern kitchen cabinetry with subway tile backsplash, sleek bathroom with bathtub and glass-enclosed shower, and recessed/ambient lighting throughout. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings with relatively narrow spacing which is good, but the sliding glass balcony doors and floor-to-ceiling bedroom windows would need childproofing locks; the flat single-level layout with no stairs is ideal for a crawling baby. Good natural light from large windows, very clean condition, and the 30.6 ping size is spacious enough for a couple with a baby."}
