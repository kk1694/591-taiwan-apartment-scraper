{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious 46-ping apartment in clean but dated condition with older-style Rinnai gas stove kitchen, beige leather sofas, marble-tiled living room floors, and hardwood bedroom floors. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) which suggests foreigner-friendly landlord. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners is a concern, but the flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus; windows appear to have secure frames and the bedrooms are unfurnished allowing flexible nursery setup. Natural light is moderate through frosted/translucent windows, and the overall cleanliness is good though finishes feel 15-20 years old."}
