{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large 70-ping apartment with dated 1990s-2000s decor featuring ornate ceiling details, traditional chandelier, and mixed flooring (tile and hardwood). The unit appears clean but unfurnished with visible wear on walls. For baby safety, the space is mostly open with few sharp corners visible, though windows have standard railings; balcony access through sliding doors would need childproofing. Natural light is moderate with windows in multiple rooms but some appear to face other buildings."}
