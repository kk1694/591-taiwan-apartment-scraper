{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Large older-style apartment (62 ping) with dated 1990s decor including ornate ceiling moldings, heavy wood built-in cabinetry, and glass display shelves throughout. The living room has polished tile floors and decent natural light from large windows, while bedrooms have worn hardwood flooring showing signs of age. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners is a concern, and the balcony access in one bedroom would need childproofing; a dehumidifier suggests possible moisture issues. The space is very generous for a family but would benefit from modernization, and the 2nd floor in a 13-story building likely means elevator access is available."}
