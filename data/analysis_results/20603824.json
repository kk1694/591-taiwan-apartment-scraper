{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern all-white apartment with recessed ceiling lighting, AC, washing machine, microwave, fridge, TV, and a separate bedroom area divided by curtains. The glass coffee table with sharp edges is a baby safety concern, and the lack of visible balcony railings is a plus. The unit appears to be two connected studio-style rooms (images show slightly different layouts suggesting it may be a combined unit), well-maintained and bright, though natural light seems moderate with curtained windows. At 23 ping on the 9th floor of a 15-story building, an elevator is very likely present."}
