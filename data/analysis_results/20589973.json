{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including new wood-look flooring, white glossy kitchen cabinets, recessed lighting, and split AC units in multiple rooms. Very clean and spacious at 28 ping with good natural light from large windows and balcony. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings that would need childproofing, and windows have security bars; no sharp corners visible and single-level layout is ideal."}
