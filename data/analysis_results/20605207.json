{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment on 12F/26F with stylish built-in cabinetry, LED accent ceiling lighting, wood-tone flooring, and a clean modern bathroom with electronic bidet toilet. The living room has large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light and city views. The bedrooms appear small with only single mattresses on the floor, which may be tight for a couple with a baby; the large sliding glass doors in the living room would need childproofing. No visible balcony railing hazards but the description is minimal (agent listing placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag — verify actual layout and furnishings in person."}
