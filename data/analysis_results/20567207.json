{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "This listing appears to be a placeholder or advertisement rather than a real rental listing - the description only contains a promotional message about agent packages with no actual property details. At 22 ping on the 15th/15th floor (top floor) for NT$50,000/month in Wanhua, this could be a reasonable apartment but top-floor units may have heat issues in Taiwan summers. Without images or a real description, baby safety features like balcony railings, stairs, and overall condition cannot be assessed - recommend visiting in person before considering."}
