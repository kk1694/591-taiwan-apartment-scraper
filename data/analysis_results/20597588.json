{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern luxury apartment with high-end marble finishes, herringbone wood flooring, and contemporary design. The open bathroom concept with glass partition between bedroom and bath is stylish but a safety concern for babies (steps near bathroom, hard marble edges). Floor 5 of 11 suggests elevator access. Good natural light from large windows; clean and well-maintained condition."}
