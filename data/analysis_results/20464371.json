{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained modern apartment with recessed ceiling lighting, AC units, and a fully equipped kitchen with gas stove and dishwasher. The unit appears clean with good natural light from mountain views. For baby safety, the balcony access visible in images would need childproofing, and the polished tile floors may be slippery; furniture has some sharp wooden corners that could be padded."}
