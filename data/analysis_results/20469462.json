{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Older-style apartment (likely 1990s) with marble tile flooring in living/dining areas and wood-look flooring in bedrooms. Furniture is dated dark-wood style but the unit is clean and spacious at 33 ping with at least 2 bedrooms. The living room has a balcony with metal railings visible through the window on the 6th floor, which is a safety concern for a baby — railings appear to have wide gaps that would need childproofing. The glass coffee table with sharp corners and the marble floors (slippery when wet) are additional baby hazards. Window-unit AC in dining area and wall-mounted split AC in bedrooms; natural light appears decent from the balcony side but limited in interior rooms. No major red flags but the description is minimal (agent listing placeholder only), so in-person verification of kitchen and bathroom condition is recommended."}
