{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Brand new, unfurnished modern apartment in a high-rise building (8F/26F) with pristine white tile floors, recessed lighting, concealed AC ducting, wall-mounted AC units, and a modern glass-enclosed bathroom with dark tile finishes. The unit appears to have multiple rooms including at least two bedrooms, a balcony with floor-to-ceiling dark-framed glass door, and a digital entry lock. For baby safety, the polished tile floors could be very slippery and the balcony glass door should be secured; however the flat single-level layout with no stairs is ideal, and there are no visible sharp corners or hazards. The space is extremely clean and move-in ready but completely unfurnished, so all furniture and appliances (beyond fridge and AC) would need to be purchased."}
