{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment in good condition with clean white kitchen, light wood flooring, TECO AC, Panasonic fridge, and open-plan living/dining area with decent natural light from floor-to-ceiling balcony windows. The balcony has metal railings that appear reasonably safe but should be checked in person; the open kitchen counter edges and floating wall shelves with small figurines could pose minor hazards for a crawling baby. The unit appears recently occupied with some moving boxes still present, suggesting a fairly new or freshly renovated space at 23.69 ping which is a reasonable size for a small family."}
