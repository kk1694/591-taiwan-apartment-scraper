{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older but clean unfurnished apartment with spacious living area, tile flooring throughout, and freshly painted white walls. The unit has an older window-unit AC in the bedroom and a wall-mounted split AC in the living area, with dated light fixtures. Being on the 1st floor with windows showing greenery very close outside, natural light appears limited; the tile floors are slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby, and the completely empty unit would need full furnishing. No visible balcony hazards or stairs, but the 1F location and lack of window grilles in some windows could be a security concern."}
