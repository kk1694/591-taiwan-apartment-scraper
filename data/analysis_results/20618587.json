{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious European-style apartment with ornate baroque furniture, damask wallpaper, and crystal chandeliers - well-maintained but dated aesthetic. Good natural light from large windows with glass block feature wall. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners, and ornate furniture pieces may pose climbing hazards; no visible balcony railings or stairs in images. Very clean and spacious at 35 ping on 13th floor of a high-rise building."}
