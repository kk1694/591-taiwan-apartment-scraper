{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated luxury apartment with high-end finishes including dark stone tile flooring in the living area, wood-look flooring in bedrooms, marble accent walls, recessed LED lighting, and built-in shelving. The unit is spacious at 46 ping with multiple rooms and appears very clean and unfurnished. For baby safety, the dark stone tile floors in the living room are hard and slippery which could be a concern for crawling/toddling; the balcony visible in image 1 has railings that should be checked for gap width. Good natural light from large windows in the main living area. No elevator info available from images; being on 6F of 7F without a confirmed elevator could be a significant drawback with a stroller and baby gear."}
