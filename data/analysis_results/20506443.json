{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei 101, Da'an District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern recessed lighting, polished tile floors, and updated kitchen. Good natural light from multiple windows with views of Taipei 101. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) without visible elevator info, the large floor-to-ceiling mirror and open layout are generally baby-safe, though the low TV platform and cabinet corners would need childproofing. Clean condition overall but kitchen shows some wear."}
