{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older Da'an apartment (5F/6F) with recently refreshed paint and flooring but dated kitchen with basic gas stove, exposed exhaust duct, and old-style cabinetry. The space is large (42.4 ping) and mostly unfurnished with decent natural light from sliding glass doors. For baby safety: the balcony has low metal railings visible through the windows, exposed pipes run along ceilings, and floor-level electrical outlets in the living area would need covers; the rear utility/laundry area has iron window bars and a gas water heater that should be checked for ventilation. No elevator is visible and at 5F of a 6-story walkup it is very likely a no-elevator building, which would be difficult with a stroller and baby."}
