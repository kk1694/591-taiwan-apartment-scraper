{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older walk-up apartment on 2F of a 4-story building in Da'an with classic parquet wood flooring throughout the living areas and terrazzo flooring in the bedroom. The unit is clean and spacious at ~85 sqm with multiple rooms separated by glass partition doors, a dining area with open kitchen, and decent natural light from windows with security grilles. For baby safety, the glass-paneled partition doors with hinges could be a pinch hazard, the open kitchen counter area lacks barriers, and the windows have iron grilles which are good for safety but being on the 2nd floor with no elevator means carrying a stroller up stairs daily; the parquet flooring shows age but is generally baby-friendly as a softer surface than tile."}
