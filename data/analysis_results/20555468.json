{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white interior, recessed lighting, curved ceiling detail, and large windows providing good natural light. The living room has a spacious layout with a leather sofa, polished tile floors, and built-in cabinetry. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreign-friendly rental agency). For baby safety, the balcony area visible through the sliding doors should be checked for railing gaps; the tile floors are smooth but slippery. At 50 ping this is a generously sized unit on the 4th floor of a 7-story building, though elevator availability is unclear. Being on 4F without a confirmed elevator could be inconvenient with a stroller."}
