{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment with high-quality finishes throughout - polished tile floors, modern kitchen with gas stove and range hood, clean bathroom with glass-enclosed shower. Good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the space is generally safe with no visible stairs or sharp furniture edges, though the hard tile floors in main areas and glass shower partition would need attention. Very clean condition with contemporary furnishings."}
