{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Large, unfurnished luxury apartment in a modern high-rise glass tower (16F/21F) in excellent condition with polished tile floors, central AC, and sliding glass doors to a balcony. The unit is very spacious at ~65 ping with multiple rooms, good natural light from large windows, and clean white walls. For baby safety, the balcony has solid railings with glass sliding doors that can be locked, and the flat single-level layout with no stairs is ideal; the polished tile floors are slippery so area rugs would be recommended. No kitchen or bathroom photos were provided which is a notable gap."}
