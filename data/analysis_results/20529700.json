{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, newly renovated unfurnished apartment with modern fixtures including split AC units, polished tile floors, and contemporary black-frame windows. Excellent natural light from large windows in multiple rooms. Good for baby safety - no visible balconies, all single-level with no stairs, rounded baseboards, and secure entry door. The 15-floor building on floor 4 strongly suggests elevator access."}
