{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "This listing appears to be a real estate agent advertisement rather than a detailed apartment listing, as the description only contains a promotional message about agent packages starting from NT$240. At 17.16 ping in Xinyi District for NT$48,000/month, the price is reasonable but being on the top floor (8F/8F) raises concerns about heat, potential leaks, and rooftop access safety for a baby. Without photos or a detailed description, it is impossible to assess modernity, elevator availability, baby safety features, or natural light conditions."}
