{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated empty space with new tile flooring, fresh white walls, track lighting, exposed conduit on ceiling, and split AC units in multiple rooms. However, this space has a strong commercial/office feel — exposed ceiling conduit, track lighting, roller blinds on large windows, and completely unfurnished with no visible kitchen or bathroom fixtures. It may be an office or commercial space rather than a residential apartment. For a couple with a baby, the hard tile floors and lack of any furnishings are concerns; natural light appears limited as all window blinds are drawn. The 15-story building on 5F likely has an elevator."}
