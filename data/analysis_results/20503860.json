{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxury modern apartment in a high-rise building with contemporary finishes including marble flooring, recessed LED lighting, central AC, and built-in cabinetry. Very clean and in excellent condition. For baby safety: the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom have low railings and would need childproofing, but overall the flat layout with no stairs is suitable. Good natural light from large windows."}
