{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "The listing description only contains a generic promotional message for real estate agents and lacks any meaningful details about the apartment itself. At 29 ping (95.7 sqm) and NT$53,000/month in Songshan District, this is a reasonably sized unit on the 2nd floor of a 4-story building. The low-rise building (4 floors) likely has no elevator, which could be inconvenient with a stroller and baby. Without images or a detailed description, it is impossible to assess modernity, baby safety features, natural light, or overall condition."}
