{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated finishes — tile floors in the living area and worn hardwood in bedrooms. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at 34 ping but shows its age with older-style windows, basic ceiling lights, and wall-mounted AC units. Natural light appears limited based on the nighttime photos with small windows facing what looks like adjacent buildings. For baby safety, the hardwood floors in some rooms appear worn and uneven which could be a tripping hazard; the balcony area visible through dark sliding doors should be checked for railing safety. Being on the 4th floor of a 5-story walkup with no visible elevator is a significant concern for carrying a baby and stroller."}
