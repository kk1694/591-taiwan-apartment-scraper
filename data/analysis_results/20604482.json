{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious unfurnished apartment with dated fixtures from the 1990s-2000s era, including older kitchen appliances and basic lighting. The balcony has decorative iron railings that a toddler could potentially squeeze through, posing a safety concern; the hard tile floors throughout would also need rugs or padding for baby safety. The unit appears clean with good natural light from large windows and balcony, but the overall condition is dated rather than modern."}
