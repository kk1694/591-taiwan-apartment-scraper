{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment with high-quality finishes, built-in kitchen with oven, washing machine, and sleek cabinetry. The unit has a raised sleeping area with steps which could be a baby safety concern; the loft-style bed platform has open railings. Good natural light from windows, and the space appears clean and well-maintained. Glass partition near bathroom adds to modern aesthetic but edges should be checked for baby-proofing."}
