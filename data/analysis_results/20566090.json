{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated with modern light wood flooring, decorative chandeliers, AC units, and white brick accent walls. Major baby safety concerns: there is an internal staircase with metal railings that a toddler could fall from or get stuck in. The unit appears to be a split-level or duplex design in an older walk-up building. Good natural light from multiple windows but the unusual layout and interior stairs make it potentially unsuitable for a family with young children."}
