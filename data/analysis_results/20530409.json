{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, spacious apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, central AC, and polished tile floors. Large sliding glass doors lead to balcony with railings that appear adequate height - would need baby-proofing for the glass table with sharp corners. Very bright and clean with minimal furniture, though the glass coffee table presents a safety concern for a crawling baby."}
