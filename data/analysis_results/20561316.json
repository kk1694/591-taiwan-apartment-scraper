{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large apartment with dated but well-maintained decor featuring marble floors and ornate finishes from the 1990s-2000s era. The balcony has traditional iron railings that may need baby gates; glass coffee table with sharp corners is a concern. Good natural light through multiple windows, very spacious rooms with clean conditions, though the style is not contemporary."}
