The unit is clean and spacious with tile flooring throughout. Baby safety concerns include glass coffee table with sharp corners, exposed wires visible in bedroom, and hard tile floors; no visible balcony railings or stairs, which is positive. Natural light appears moderate from windows. The intercom system by the door suggests an older building without clear elevator indication."}
