{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxury high-rise apartment in a modern building with upscale common areas including a lounge/library and café-style lobby. The unit is unfurnished with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, open-plan kitchen with counter, and large windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the hard tile floors are slippery and would need rugs/mats; the unit appears to be a single level with no stairs, and windows have solid frames — overall a very clean, well-maintained space in a premium 20-story building with elevator, though the description is minimal (agent listing placeholder only)."}
