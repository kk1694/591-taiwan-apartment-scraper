{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including recessed lighting, central AC, sleek kitchen with island bar, and quality furniture. Very clean and bright with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: no visible stairs, floor-to-ceiling windows appear to have balcony access that would need childproofing; bar stools and glass coffee table are potential hazards that can be addressed with baby-proofing."}
