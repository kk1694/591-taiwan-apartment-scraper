{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed ceiling lighting, large leather sectional sofa, and polished tile floors throughout. The living room is very large at 36 ping with good natural light from multiple windows fitted with security grilles, and sliding glass doors leading to what appears to be additional rooms. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp metal/glass corners that would need padding, and the tile floors are very slippery; however, the windows have security grilles which is a positive safety feature, and the flat open layout with no visible stairs is ideal for a crawling baby."}
