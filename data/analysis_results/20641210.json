{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "High-end luxury apartment with premium herringbone wood flooring, marble accent walls, recessed lighting, and a modern open kitchen with built-in appliances. The unit is unfurnished and in excellent condition with upscale finishes including video intercom and glass sliding doors. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom appear to have secure frames, but the dark flooring and hard marble surfaces could be slippery; the balcony area and window accessibility should be checked in person. Good natural light from large windows in the bedroom, and the 11-story building on floor 5 very likely has an elevator."}
