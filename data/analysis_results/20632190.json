{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older apartment (70+ ping) with dated fixtures from 1990s-2000s era, featuring Japanese-style shoji screens, ornate ceiling details, and beige tile flooring throughout. For baby safety, the raised tatami platform area presents a tripping/falling hazard, and the open bathtub in the bathroom requires supervision. The unit appears clean but unfurnished with adequate natural light from windows, though the overall aesthetic is quite dated rather than modern."}
