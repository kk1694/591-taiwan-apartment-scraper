{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern high-rise apartment in excellent condition with sleek finishes including recessed lighting, polished tile floors, and a contemporary grey kitchen with built-in appliances. Excellent natural light from multiple large windows with city views. For baby safety: the unit appears to be single-level with no visible stairs, though hard tile flooring in living areas may need rugs; the bedroom has warmer wood flooring which is preferable. No balconies visible in photos, reducing fall risks."}
