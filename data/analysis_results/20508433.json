{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment with elegant finishes including crystal chandeliers, recessed ceiling lighting, and quality wood flooring. Excellent natural light from large windows. For baby safety: the balcony visible in image 5 has standard railings that would need baby gates; furniture has relatively rounded edges; the open-plan kitchen with bar stools could be a concern when baby becomes mobile. Overall very clean and in excellent condition."}
