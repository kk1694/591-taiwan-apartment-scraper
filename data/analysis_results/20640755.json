{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, large tile flooring, and built-in wooden cabinetry throughout. Very clean condition with at least 2 bedrooms and a generous living area. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling sliding doors with metal security bars which is good, but furniture corners (coffee table, bed frames) would need padding. Natural light appears limited in some rooms but adequate overall."}
