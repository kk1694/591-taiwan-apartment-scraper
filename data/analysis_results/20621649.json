{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "The only available image shows a neglected enclosed balcony area with a large outdoor AC unit, rusted metal bar railings, deteriorating corrugated roof panels with vegetation growing through, and general disrepair. This is a major red flag for baby safety and overall livability — the space looks poorly maintained with exposed metal structures, rust, and debris. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), providing no useful details about the interior layout or condition. At NT$52,000/month for 29.5 ping in Zhongzheng, this appears overpriced given the visible condition. Not recommended for a couple expecting a baby."}
