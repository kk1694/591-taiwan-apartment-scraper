{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 63-ping apartment on 2F of a 15-story building in Shilin with older-style furnishings including heavy wooden bedroom furniture, window AC units, and dated light fixtures. The balcony has glass panel railings that are a significant baby safety concern as a toddler could potentially climb the brick base and reach over; the balcony is large but on the 2nd floor. The unit is clean with decent natural light, laminate wood flooring throughout, and a generous layout including a dining area with kitchen pass-through, but the overall condition and fixtures feel dated rather than modern."}
