{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with modern furnishings including a large L-shaped sofa, split AC, intercom system, and a fully equipped white kitchen with range hood and refrigerator. The second bedroom has a small balcony with metal railings that appear adequately spaced but would need baby-proofing; the bed frame in the master bedroom has low sharp corners to watch for. Good natural light from windows in living room and balcony door in bedroom; overall very clean condition and suitable for a family, though the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only) which is a minor red flag worth investigating further."}
