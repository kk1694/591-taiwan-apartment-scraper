{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end unfurnished apartment with recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, built-in central AC, and a sleek white kitchen with gas stove and built-in dish dryer. The unit is on the 7th floor of an 11-story building (almost certainly has elevator), spacious at 49 ping with multiple rooms visible. For baby safety, the hard tile floors would need rugs/mats, but the unit has no visible stairs and appears single-level; the windows have modern dark-framed casements that appear secure, and the empty rooms have no sharp corners from furniture — overall a clean, well-maintained luxury apartment suitable for a family, though it will need full furnishing."}
