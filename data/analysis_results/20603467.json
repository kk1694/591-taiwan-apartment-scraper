{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in a newer high-rise building with recessed lighting, marble-look flooring, central AC, and a sleek open kitchen. Very clean condition with minimal furniture and no visible sharp corners or hazards for a baby. The space appears to be on a single level with large floor-to-ceiling windows that have proper railings; good natural light potential when curtains are open."}
