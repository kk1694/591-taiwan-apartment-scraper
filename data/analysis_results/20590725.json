{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including light wood kitchen cabinets, stainless steel appliances, and grey laminate flooring. Spacious open layout with good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety: the space is mostly open with no visible stairs, though the balcony/laundry area should be childproofed; furniture has some sharp corners on the dining table. Building appears well-maintained and at 8F/12F almost certainly has an elevator."}
