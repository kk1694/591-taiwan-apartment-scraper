{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "羅斯福路三段155號 (Roosevelt Road Section 3, No. 155)", "notes": "Very modern studio apartment in a new high-rise building with contemporary finishes including wood paneling, recessed lighting, and modern kitchen with washer. The open-plan layout has minimal sharp corners and no visible stairs, though the space is compact at 10 ping which could feel cramped with baby gear. Good natural light from balcony door; building entrance shows secure lobby with mailboxes. Clean and well-maintained condition overall."}
