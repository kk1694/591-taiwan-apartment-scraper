{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious 43-ping apartment in decent but dated condition — dark hardwood floors, recessed cove lighting, and older-style fixtures suggest a 1990s-era renovation that has not been recently updated. The glass coffee table in the living room and the glass-topped bedside table have sharp corners that are a baby safety concern, and the bathtub with glass partition in the bathroom will need child-proofing. Natural light appears moderate with windows in the living room and bedroom, but curtains are drawn; the kitchen is narrow and enclosed with no natural light. Listed via HOYUAN Real Estate Agency (禾源外商租屋管理公司), a foreigner-friendly agency, which is a plus, though the NT$95,000 price feels high for the dated finishes."}
