{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a high-end modern apartment in excellent condition with luxury finishes including crystal chandeliers, recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, and an open-plan kitchen with island and built-in appliances. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp edges and the balcony railings appear to have wide spacing that would require childproofing; the hard tile floors are slippery."}
