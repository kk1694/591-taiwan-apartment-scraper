{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious upscale apartment with ornate wood paneling, crystal chandeliers, and marble floors — luxurious but dated in style (early 2000s aesthetic). The living room has large bay windows with blinds providing good natural light, and the bedrooms feature built-in platform beds and extensive custom cabinetry. For baby safety, the polished marble floors in the living area are very slippery and the low platform bed frames have hard wooden edges; however, the flat single-level layout with no visible stairs is a plus, and the bedrooms have warmer hardwood flooring."}
