{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment at 37 ping in Da'an district, clean with polished tile floors but dated decor including ornate wallpaper and older-style light fixtures. The building is 17 floors so almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the unit is mostly open and flat with no visible stairs; bedrooms have window grilles for security, and the sliding balcony doors in the living room would need child locks. The apartment appears very clean but sparsely furnished (only a marble dining table visible), with AC units in each room and built-in wardrobes in the bedrooms — a solid blank canvas but will require significant furniture investment."}
