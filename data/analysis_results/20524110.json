{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious upscale apartment with polished marble floors, recessed lighting, and quality leather furniture in good condition. The balcony has ornate metal railings which are a moderate concern for baby safety once mobile - would need protective netting or barriers. Excellent natural light from large windows and an enclosed kitchen with sliding glass doors. Building appears well-maintained; 14-floor building on 5F strongly suggests elevator. Glass coffee table edges and hard marble floors may need baby-proofing padding."}
