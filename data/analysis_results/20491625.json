{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wu Xing Street 600 Lane (吳興街600巷), Xinyi District, Daxin Xinyi Wenhua community, near Songren Road", "notes": "Brand new, never-occupied 2BR/2BA unit on 12F/13F of an elevator building with Taipei 101 views. Move-in ready with full furnishings and high-end finishes — excellent condition for a young family. Two balconies warrant checking railing height/gap spacing for baby safety; the duplex 12F/13F layout likely means internal stairs which is a significant concern with a crawling baby — stair gates would be essential. South-facing orientation suggests good natural light. At NT$90,000/month plus NT$4,115 management fee, this is premium pricing but the Xinyi location, newness, and views justify it."}
