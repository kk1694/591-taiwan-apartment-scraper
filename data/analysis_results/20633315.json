{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated, very clean unfurnished apartment with modern light wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, brand-new white kitchen with gas stove, range hood, and built-in microwave. The 14-floor building almost certainly has an elevator. Multiple rooms with good natural light from large windows; the open layout with smooth floors and no visible stairs or sharp corners is quite baby-friendly, though the kitchen is open-plan so baby-gating the cooking area would be advisable. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) in Wanhua district at 24 ping — spacious for the price but the description is minimal (just an ad promo), which is a minor red flag worth verifying."}
