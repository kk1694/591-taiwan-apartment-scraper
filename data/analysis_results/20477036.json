{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment in Zhongshan with clean white tile floors, recessed/cove lighting, wood-panel accent walls, open kitchen with washing machine, and black leather sofa. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with a contemporary design. For baby safety, the glass partition panels near the TV area and the hard tile floors are concerns; natural light appears limited with small windows facing other buildings, and only the living/kitchen area is shown — no bedroom or bathroom photos are available, which is a minor red flag."}
