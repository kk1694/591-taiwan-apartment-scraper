{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed LED lighting, open kitchen with washer/dishwasher, and two bedrooms. The bedroom has a balcony with sliding glass doors that could pose a baby safety concern - glass is floor-to-ceiling and balcony access would need childproofing. Good natural light from windows and balcony. Clean condition with minimal sharp corners on furniture."}
