{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with stylish furniture, designer pendant lights, marble countertops, and polished tile floors. The space is clean, bright, and well-maintained with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need protection, but the layout is otherwise open and single-level with no stairs visible; the kitchen has a glass partition which is helpful. A 14-story building on the 2nd floor almost certainly has an elevator."}
