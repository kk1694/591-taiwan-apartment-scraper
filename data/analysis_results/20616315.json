{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This is a very large open-plan studio space (25.81 ping) with low ceilings and strip windows positioned high on the walls, suggesting it may be a rooftop addition (頂加) or converted commercial/warehouse space on floor 10 of 11. The space is clean with white flooring and walls, basic furnishings (bed, sofa, TV, wardrobe, desk), AC, and ceiling fan, but the unusual ceiling angles and high narrow windows are red flags. For a baby, the open layout has no sharp room divisions which is good, but the low ceilings, limited natural light, and questionable legality of a possible rooftop addition are concerns worth investigating before committing."}
