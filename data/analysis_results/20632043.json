{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a multi-level townhouse (透天) rather than a flat apartment, as visible stairs connect the floors in the dining area. The interior is clean with polished tile floors and recessed lighting, but the wooden furniture and cabinetry style are dated rather than modern. The staircase with no visible baby gate is a significant safety concern for a crawling baby or toddler, and the 1st floor windows have iron security grilles which limit natural light. The bedroom appears small and windowless, and the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a red flag."}
