{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Renovated older building with new light wood laminate flooring and freshly painted white walls, but the structure shows its age with exposed beams, older-style window grilles, and dated wall-mounted AC units. The apartment is unfurnished and spacious at ~38.9 ping with multiple rooms, decent natural light from several windows, and appears clean. For baby safety, the windows have metal security grilles which is good, but the dark baseboards have sharp edges, and being on 6F with no confirmed elevator would be a significant concern for carrying a stroller; the description is minimal (agent listing placeholder) so key details like kitchen/bathroom condition and elevator status remain unknown."}
