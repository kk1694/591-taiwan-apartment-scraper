{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed LED ceiling lighting, central air conditioning, polished tile and hardwood floors, and built-in cabinetry. The living room is large with a sectional sofa, flat-screen TV, and balcony access; the bedroom features built-in wardrobes, a vanity desk, and dark wood flooring. The entryway has a decorative stone wall feature. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors in the living area could be slippery, and the balcony door/access visible in the living room would need child-proofing; no dangerous stairs are visible. At 63 ping this is a very large unit on floor 4 of 7 — elevator status is unclear from the images but common for this building type. Overall clean, bright, and move-in ready, though the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag regarding transparency."}
