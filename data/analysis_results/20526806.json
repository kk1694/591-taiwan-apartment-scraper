{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Tianmu area (Shilin)", "notes": "High-end modern apartment in excellent condition with quality finishes including marble bathroom, recessed lighting, and glass-enclosed shower. The building appears to be a luxury complex with rooftop pool and mountain views. Good for a family - spacious living areas with smooth floors suitable for a crawling baby, though the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need child-proofing. Natural light is decent through balcony doors. Clean and well-maintained throughout."}
