{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with Bosch built-in appliances (oven, microwave, dishwasher), sleek open-plan kitchen with island counter, polished stone/marble floors, and large windows with mountain views providing good natural light. The unit is on the 6th floor of an 11-story building, which strongly suggests an elevator. For baby safety, the polished hard floors could be slippery, the kitchen island has sharp corners that would need padding, and the balcony door has horizontal bars which are positive for child safety; however, the apartment is unfurnished so baby-proofing can be customized. At 66 ping this is a spacious, premium apartment well-suited for a growing family."}
