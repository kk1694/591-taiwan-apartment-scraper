{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin mountainside area", "notes": "Very large 160-ping hillside house in Shilin with polished marble floors, older-style fixtures (chandelier, wall-mounted AC, dated windows), and mountain views. The building is a 2-story white-tiled structure on a steep hillside road, far from urban amenities. Baby safety concerns include extremely slippery polished marble floors, external stairs to access the building, balcony with sliding doors, and the remote mountainous location which would make emergency access difficult. Good natural light from large windows but the isolated hillside location and lack of nearby facilities are significant drawbacks for a family expecting a baby."}
