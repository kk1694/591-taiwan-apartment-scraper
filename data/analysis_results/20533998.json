{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern loft-style duplex apartment with exposed wooden beams, updated kitchen with large refrigerator, and good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Major baby safety concern: there are internal wooden stairs without visible gates or railings, plus a ladder on the wall in the living room, which pose significant fall hazards for a crawling baby or toddler. The apartment appears clean and well-maintained with stylish furnishings."}
