{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with recessed lighting, hardwood floors, designer Togo-style leather sofas, glass coffee table, and a chandelier. The living room is spacious with large windows providing good natural light, and the bedroom has built-in shelving and a desk area suitable for a nursery conversion. Baby safety concerns include the glass coffee table with sharp edges and the low leather sofas which are soft but close to the ground; the floors are smooth hardwood which is easy to clean but slippery. At 9F in a 13-floor building, it very likely has an elevator, and the high floor reduces balcony safety concerns. Listed via Miller House agency; description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), so further details on layout and kitchen/bathroom should be confirmed directly."}
