{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylish apartment with high ceilings, recessed lighting, split AC, and contemporary furnishings in excellent condition. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the open shelving with decorative items poses a climbing/pulling hazard for toddlers. Good natural light from large windows, clean and well-maintained space with a minimalist aesthetic."}
