{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, ceiling fan, and contemporary furniture. The balcony has metal railings with adequate spacing for baby safety, though the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need attention. Good natural light from balcony door and windows; bedroom has a small single bed that would need replacing for a couple."}
