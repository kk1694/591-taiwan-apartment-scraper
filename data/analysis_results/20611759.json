{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Jianguo North Road, 50m from Jingan Park MRT", "notes": "First-floor 3BR/2BA unit with front and rear courtyards in elevator building. Medium-level renovation suggests decent but not brand-new condition. Ground floor with courtyards could be good for a baby (no stairs inside, outdoor space), but first-floor units may have less natural light and privacy concerns. Direct owner listing with included parking. No photos available to assess baby safety features like railings or sharp corners."}
