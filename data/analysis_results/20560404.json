{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment in Da'an with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, split AC units, and a fully furnished living area with TV, sofa, fridge, and built-in kitchen cabinetry. The bedroom is compact but clean with a double bed, wardrobe, air purifier, and a decorative red accent wall. For baby safety, the floor-to-ceiling sliding glass balcony doors in the living room would need childproofing, and the low platform bed frame has edges to watch for; the space is relatively small at 18.5 ping for a couple with a baby but the open layout and smooth floors are easy to keep clean. The building appears to be a modern high-rise (5F/9F) likely with elevator, and natural light comes through the balcony and bedroom windows, though views are partially blocked by adjacent buildings."}
