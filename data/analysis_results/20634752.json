{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment on the top floor (11F/11F) in Da'an with clean white walls, wood-look flooring, modern kitchen, crystal chandelier, and AC units. The upstairs mezzanine bedroom has low ceilings and a spacious layout with wardrobe storage and a desk area. Major baby safety concern: the internal staircase has only a thin metal railing with wide gaps and no baby gate, posing a serious fall risk for a crawling/toddling child; the loft bedroom also likely has an open edge or low railing. Natural light is decent from windows on the main level but the upper loft bedroom appears to have no windows. The description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag."}
