{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated finishes - ceramic tile floors, old-style window AC units, basic fluorescent lighting, and some wall discoloration/stains visible. Being on the 5th floor with no elevator shown is a concern. The balcony has standard railings visible through sliding doors which would need baby-proofing; the spacious open layout is good but loose cables on floors pose tripping hazards for toddlers."}
