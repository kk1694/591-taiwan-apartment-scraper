{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern white cabinetry, stainless steel appliances, recessed lighting, and contemporary bathroom fixtures including bathtub. The space is very clean with good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the open floor plan has no stairs but the low window sills in bedrooms and lack of visible balcony railings should be assessed; sharp-cornered furniture edges on the built-in shelving may need padding."}
