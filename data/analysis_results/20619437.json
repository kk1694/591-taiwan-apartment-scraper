{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, well-maintained older apartment with dated but functional furniture (traditional floral sofas, wooden coffee table). Spacious open layout with good natural light and polished hardwood floors. For baby safety: no visible stairs or dangerous balconies, but low platform bed and furniture corners should be padded. The building appears to be an older walkup (2F of 4F) without visible elevator, and shows a convenience store nearby from window view."}
