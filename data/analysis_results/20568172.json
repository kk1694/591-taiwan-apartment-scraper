{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Large 60-ping apartment on 9F of a 19-story building with dated but functional finishes. The living room is very cluttered with office-like furniture, files, and a Taiwan flag, suggesting it may have been used as a home office; the kitchen floor has items scattered about and needs cleaning before move-in. Windows have security bars which are good for baby safety on a high floor, but the overall condition is worn with older wooden cabinetry and mixed flooring; the walk-in closet is a nice feature but the apartment would require significant decluttering and deep cleaning, and sharp desk corners in the study room would need baby-proofing."}
