{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "This listing appears to be a real estate agent advertisement rather than a detailed apartment listing, as the description only contains a promotion for agent listing packages (starting from NT$240 per listing). At 25 ping on the 7th floor of a 14-story building, it is likely a standard residential apartment with elevator access, but no images or detailed description are available to confirm condition, layout, or baby safety features. The price of NT$46,000/month for 25 ping in Zhongzheng District is reasonable but the lack of detailed information is a red flag — request photos and a viewing before proceeding."}
