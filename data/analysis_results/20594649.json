{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated furniture including traditional Chinese-style wooden bed alcove and vintage sofas. Clean but showing age with mixed flooring (tile in living room, hardwood in bedroom). The glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a concern for a baby. Good natural light from multiple windows. No visible balcony hazards but overall dated condition may require updates."}
