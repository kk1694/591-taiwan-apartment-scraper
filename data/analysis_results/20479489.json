{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, ceiling fan, and a built-in TV wall unit. The unit has a raised platform area with wooden steps behind louvered closet doors which could be a baby safety concern (fall risk from the elevated section). Glass coffee table with sharp edges is also a hazard. Good natural light from large balcony sliding doors; the balcony railing appears to have adequate height. Overall clean and well-maintained condition; listed through a multilingual property management agency (Your House). The description is mostly agent advertisement text with minimal property details, which is a minor red flag."}
