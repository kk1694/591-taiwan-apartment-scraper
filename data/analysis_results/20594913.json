{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious, well-maintained apartment with high-end finishes including marble flooring, recessed ceiling lighting, and central air conditioning. The spacious open layout with smooth floors and no visible stairs is baby-friendly, though the hard marble surfaces would require rugs for cushioning. Good natural light from windows; being on the 5th floor of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
