{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with updated fixtures, clean laminate flooring, and contemporary furniture including leather sofa and modern kitchen. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners to consider, and the balcony sliding doors should be secured; no obvious stair hazards visible. Overall very clean condition with at least 2 bedrooms."}
