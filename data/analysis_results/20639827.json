{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including recessed LED lighting, light wood laminate flooring, and built-in wardrobes with clean lines. The space is very clean with multiple rooms and AC units. For baby safety: floors are smooth without steps visible between rooms, no exposed sharp corners, but the balcony in image 4 has horizontal railings that could be climbable - would need baby gates. Limited natural light visible in most rooms, though the balcony area shows windows."}
