{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with updated fixtures, light wood flooring, and clean white walls. Spacious living area with good natural light from balcony doors. The bedroom has two beds with a large mirrored wall. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the balcony access should be monitored. Overall very clean and move-in ready condition."}
