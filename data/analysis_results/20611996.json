{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Near Taipei 101, Xinyi District", "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/office space rather than a residential apartment - it has drop ceiling with fluorescent office lighting, commercial-style tiled floors, and no kitchen or bathroom visible. The space is unfurnished and has an office-like layout. Not suitable for a family with a baby as this is clearly designed for commercial use, not residential living. The street view shows proximity to Taipei 101."}
