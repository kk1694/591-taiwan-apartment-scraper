{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment on 15F/27F with high-quality finishes including marble accent wall, recessed LED lighting, central AC, polished tile floors, glass-enclosed shower, and built-in cabinetry. Excellent natural light from large corner windows with metal safety railings and roller blinds; the unit is unfurnished and very clean. Baby safety concerns include the hard polished tile floors (slippery), the glass shower partition in the bathroom, and the balcony railings near the living room windows, though the window bars appear adequately spaced. The description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and included appliances."}
