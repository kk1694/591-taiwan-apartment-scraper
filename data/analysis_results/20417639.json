{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and well-furnished apartment with stylish pendant lighting, L-shaped sectional sofa, 6-seat dining table, and clean polished tile floors throughout. The unit appears newly renovated with contemporary fixtures, wall-mounted AC, and designer furniture. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the bedroom shown has a low platform bed on a slatted base which is relatively safe; however, only 5 photos were provided showing the living/dining area and one small bedroom — no kitchen, bathroom, or balcony views are available, so full baby-proofing assessment is limited. The 14-story building on the 2nd floor in Zhongshan district very likely has an elevator; the listing description is minimal (just an agent promotion) which is a minor red flag — request more details and photos before committing at NT$82,000/month."}
