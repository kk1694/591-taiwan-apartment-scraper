{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment from 1980s-90s era with dated fixtures including window AC units, pink tile balcony, and basic furnishings. The building exterior shows age with weathered facade. For baby safety, the enclosed balcony with security grilles is positive, but the overall dated condition and visible exposed wiring on ceiling need attention. Decent natural light through multiple windows but rooms appear somewhat cramped despite the listed size."}
