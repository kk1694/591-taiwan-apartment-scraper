{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with stylish interior. Features leather sofa, modern light fixtures, flat-screen TV, and open-plan living/dining/kitchen layout. For baby safety: sharp coffee table corners may need padding, and TV/cables should be secured. Good natural light and clean condition. The 2nd floor location in a 4-story building suggests no elevator, but this keeps the unit accessible."}
