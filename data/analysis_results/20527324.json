{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with new light wood laminate flooring, fresh white walls, modern sliding doors, split AC units in multiple rooms, and large sliding glass doors opening to a balcony with greenery views. The spacious living area and bedrooms are completely unfurnished, giving flexibility for baby-proofing. The balcony with low railing visible through the glass doors is a safety concern for a crawling/walking baby and would need child-proof locks on the sliding doors. Being on the top floor (5F/5F) with no confirmed elevator is a significant drawback for carrying a baby and stroller up five flights of stairs."}
