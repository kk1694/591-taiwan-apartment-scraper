{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). Living room has stylish track lighting, leather sofa, flat-screen TV, AC, and light wood flooring. Two bedrooms visible — one smaller room with mattress on floor and one master with proper bed frame; both have AC and venetian blinds but limited natural light (1F unit with small windows). Being on the 1st floor is convenient for a baby stroller but the glass partition between living room and bedroom area and the low coffee table with glass top are minor baby-proofing concerns."}
