{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with modern built-in cabinetry, polished tile floors in living areas, and hardwood flooring in one bedroom. The living room is large with recessed ceiling lighting and a leather sectional sofa; bedrooms include built-in wardrobes and a children's flower wall decal suggesting previous family use. The flat floors with no stairs are baby-friendly, though the coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need padding; no balcony or dangerous railings are visible in the photos, and the 12-story building on the 6th floor very likely has an elevator."}
