{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, spacious apartment in excellent condition with clean white tile floors, recessed ceiling lighting, and built-in AC. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows in multiple rooms. The balcony has proper railings visible through glass doors; floors are smooth tile with minimal sharp corners, though parents would need to baby-proof the low coffee table edges and ensure balcony doors remain secured."}
