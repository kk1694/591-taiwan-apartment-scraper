{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Clean, well-maintained 1F unit in a 6-story building with high ceilings in the living room, large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light, polished tile floors, and AC units in bedrooms. Being on the 1st floor with a front courtyard/patio area is convenient for a family with a baby (no stairs needed), but the entry steps from the courtyard could be a minor concern. The bedrooms are spacious with basic wooden furniture; windows have security grilles which add safety. The description is minimal (just an agent ad), so no specific details about layout or amenities are provided — recommend visiting in person to check kitchen, bathrooms, and whether the unit may feel damp being on the ground floor."}
