{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Yuanqu Street, Nangang District, near Taipei Software Park MRT Station (303m)", "notes": "Spacious 4BR/2BA family apartment at 34 ping with elevator, parking, natural gas, 2 balconies, and full furnishings including fridge, washer, AC, and sofa. Pet-friendly and cooking allowed, which is great for a family. The 2nd floor location is convenient but the 2 balconies warrant inspection for baby-safe railings; no interior photos were analyzable to confirm modern condition or identify sharp corners/hazards, so an in-person visit is recommended. Proximity to Taipei Software Park MRT (303m) is excellent for commuting."}
