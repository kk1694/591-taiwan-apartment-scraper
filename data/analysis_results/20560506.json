{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is clearly a ground-floor commercial/retail storefront, NOT a residential apartment. It has a glass storefront entrance (address #390), display shelving with arch-shaped backlit niches, and opens directly to the street — entirely unsuitable for residential use or for a family with a baby. No kitchen, no bathroom, no bedroom visible; the space is an empty shop with a small sink area in the back. The description also references a real estate sales package, further confirming this is a commercial listing. Completely inappropriate for residential living."}
