{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, updated kitchen with gas stove and range hood, and a clean bathroom with bathtub. Balcony has metal railings that appear safe but would need baby-proofing once child is mobile. Good natural light through multiple windows; the 4th floor location in a 12-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
