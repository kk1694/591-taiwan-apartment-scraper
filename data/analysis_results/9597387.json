{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "This listing appears to be a real estate agent advertisement rather than a detailed apartment listing, as the description only contains a promotional message about agent pricing packages. At 37.1 ping (122.4 sqm) for NT$50,000/month in Nangang, the size is generous for a family. Without photos or a detailed description, it is impossible to assess baby safety features, natural light, or overall condition; an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
