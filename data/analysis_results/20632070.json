{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with marble floors, recessed lighting, and large sliding glass doors providing excellent natural light. Balcony has relatively low railings which would require safety gates for a crawling baby/toddler. Very clean condition with modern fixtures; the open floor plan and smooth floors are baby-friendly once mobile hazards like the glass furniture are addressed."}
