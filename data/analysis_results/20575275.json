{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Dated 1990s-era apartment with marble floors, ornate ceiling moldings, old-style wooden furniture, and window-unit AC — clean but not modern. The glass coffee table with sharp corners and the open balcony with low metal railings visible in images 1-2 are baby safety concerns. The living room gets decent natural light from the balcony-side windows, and the space is generous at ~35 ping, but the karaoke-style wall-mounted speakers and overall decor feel worn and the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag."}
