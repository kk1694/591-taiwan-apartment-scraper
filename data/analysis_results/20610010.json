{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older walk-up apartment on 3F/5F in Nangang with dated fixtures, stained ceilings showing possible water damage, exposed electrical conduit, and aging appliances including an old yellowish refrigerator. The unit is spacious at 56 ping with multiple bedrooms along a long corridor (one has bunk beds suggesting possible shared housing history), but natural light appears limited with small windows. For a couple with a baby, concerns include the lack of elevator (3rd floor walk-up difficult with stroller/infant), the water-stained ceiling suggesting moisture/mold issues, and the overall worn condition that may require significant cleaning and childproofing."}
