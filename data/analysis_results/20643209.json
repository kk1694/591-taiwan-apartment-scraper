{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "Very modern duplex (樓中樓) apartment with high-end finishes: wood panel walls, 70-inch Philips 4K TV, Simmons luxury mattress, Italian leather sofa, Philips smart bidet, and wet/dry separated bathroom. The unit has a balcony with plants and good natural light from large upgraded black-frame windows. Baby safety concerns: this is a loft/duplex with internal stairs which is a significant hazard for a crawling baby or toddler; the balcony also needs childproofing. Overall the apartment is in excellent, hotel-like condition but the stairs are a notable risk for a family with a baby."}
