{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a duplex-style apartment with internal staircase, appearing well-maintained with modern recessed lighting, AC units, and clean tile/wood flooring. For baby safety, the internal staircase is a significant concern as it has open railings that a toddler could slip through; a safety gate would be essential. The space has decent natural light from multiple windows, and overall the apartment is spacious and in good condition."}
