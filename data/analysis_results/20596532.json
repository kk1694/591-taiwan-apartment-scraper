{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio-style apartment with high-end built-in cabinetry, Murphy/wall bed, modern LED ring lighting, recessed AC, and wood-tone laminate flooring throughout. The space is clean and stylishly furnished but quite narrow and compact; the bed folds out into the living area which limits usable floor space. For a couple with a baby, the ladder attached to the loft storage shelving is a safety concern, and the narrow layout would make it difficult to fit a crib alongside the fold-down bed. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows; being on 6F of a 12F building in Zhongshan strongly suggests elevator access."}
