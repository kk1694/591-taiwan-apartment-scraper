{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious, clean apartment with ornate crown molding giving it a somewhat dated aesthetic despite good condition. The unit has at least two bedrooms with basic furniture, wall-mounted AC units, and glossy tile floors throughout. For baby safety, the windows have security grilles and there are no visible stairs or dangerous balconies, though the hard tile floors and sharp furniture corners would need baby-proofing."}
