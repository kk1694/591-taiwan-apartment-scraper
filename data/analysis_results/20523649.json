{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very spacious unfurnished apartment (75 ping) on the 15th floor of a 21-story building with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors and large windows in multiple rooms. The unit is in clean, modern condition with polished tile floors, built-in closets, and air conditioning; the balcony has full-height glass railings which is good for baby safety, though the sliding doors to the balcony would need childproofing. Listed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly agency with Japanese services), the unit is completely empty so you'd need to furnish it entirely, but the high floor and large open layout are ideal for a growing family."}
