{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained, stylishly furnished apartment with modern finishes including leather sofas, projector system, and glass furniture. The glass coffee table and dining table have sharp corners that would need baby-proofing. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light with views of greenery; windows appear to have secure frames. Spacious layout at 48 ping is suitable for a family, though the open shelving and glass display cabinets may need securing for a toddler."}
