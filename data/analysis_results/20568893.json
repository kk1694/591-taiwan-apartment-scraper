{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated ground floor unit with modern finishes, wood-look flooring, white walls, new kitchen with gas stove and cabinets. Good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety: being on 1F means no elevator concerns but the outdoor courtyard area has exposed AC units and uneven surfaces; the interior appears safe with no visible stairs or sharp corners. The unit is unfurnished and very clean."}
