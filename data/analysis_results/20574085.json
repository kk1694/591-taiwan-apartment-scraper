{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with high-end finishes including built-in cabinetry, smart toilet, recessed lighting, and a sleek U-shaped kitchen with washer. Listed through UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋), a foreigner-friendly agency. At 11F/14F the building certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the bar stools in the living area are a tip-over risk, and the dark marble/stone ledge near the TV could have sharp edges; the bathroom has a bathtub with a step which needs supervision, but overall the unit is clean, bright with large windows, and free of major red flags."}
