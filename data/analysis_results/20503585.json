{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious, well-maintained apartment with elegant finishes including crystal chandeliers, built-in cabinetry, and modern kitchen appliances. The living room has a balcony with railings that appear adequate but would need baby-proofing; the slick tile floors throughout could be slippery. Excellent natural light from large windows, very clean condition with high-end decor - suitable for a family though the sharp-edged furniture and glass coffee table are potential hazards for a crawling baby."}
