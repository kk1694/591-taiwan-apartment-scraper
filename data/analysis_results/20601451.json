{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious and clean apartment with polished tile floors, large windows providing good natural light, split AC units, built-in storage cabinets, and an en-suite bathroom in the master bedroom. The unit appears recently renovated with modern finishes. For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery, the bedroom has a balcony/window with metal railings that appear secure, and there are no visible sharp corners on the built-in cabinetry. At 30 ping on the 3rd floor of a 4-story building, it likely has no elevator which would be inconvenient with a stroller; the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only) which is a minor red flag."}
