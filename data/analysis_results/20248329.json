{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Brand new luxury apartment in a modern high-rise (6F/24F) with premium finishes including hardwood floors, recessed LED lighting, black marble kitchen counters, and built-in oven. The unit is unfurnished and in pristine condition with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a balcony. Note: image 1 is labeled as a decoration reference rendering (裝潢示意圖), not the actual unit. The balcony has glass and metal railings which would need childproofing for baby safety; the balcony gap spacing should be verified in person. Overall a high-end, clean, and safe-feeling space, but the compact kitchen and open layout may need baby-proofing at sharp marble corners."}
