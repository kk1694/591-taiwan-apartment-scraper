{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with contemporary finishes, recessed lighting, AC units, and clean white tile floors. The unit appears spacious with a separate bedroom, living area, and kitchenette with washer. For baby safety, note the raised black stone step near the TV wall which could be a tripping hazard; the low coffee table and furniture have rounded edges which is positive. Windows have privacy film but natural light seems limited based on window size."}
