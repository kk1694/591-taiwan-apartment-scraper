{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Modern, clean studio with Murphy wall bed, white cabinetry, washer/dryer, fridge, microwave, and kitchenette with counter. The space is very compact at 11 ping — essentially a single open room which would be quite tight for a couple with a baby, especially once the bed is folded down. Baby safety concerns include the metal Murphy bed frame mechanism and the bar stool/high table setup; natural light appears limited with windows facing closely to adjacent buildings."}
