{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-maintained older apartment with wood-paneled accent walls, crystal chandelier, leather sofa, and glass coffee table — a dated but clean Taiwanese style, not modern. Living room has sliding glass doors to a small balcony; the glass coffee table with sharp corners is a baby hazard, and the balcony access needs child-proofing. A smaller room with hardwood floors, window bars, and basic shelving could serve as a nursery but has limited natural light; the 2F walkup with no visible elevator is a concern for stroller access."}
