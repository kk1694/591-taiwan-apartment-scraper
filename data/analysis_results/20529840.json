{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older but clean unfurnished apartment with wood-look laminate flooring and white walls. The unit appears spacious with multiple rooms, AC units installed, and sliding balcony doors visible. For baby safety, the balcony access would need childproofing; no major hazards visible but flooring appears slippery. Natural light is moderate through windows; the overall condition is dated but well-maintained."}
