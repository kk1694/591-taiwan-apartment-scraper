{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang, near Lexus dealership visible from balcony", "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with designer-quality interior featuring green kitchen cabinets, wood flooring, rattan pendant lights, and abundant hanging plants. The open-plan living/dining/kitchen area is very spacious at 43 ping with excellent natural light from large windows on the 14th floor. Baby safety concerns include the balcony which has a half-wall railing that a toddler could potentially climb using the wooden ledge/shelf, and the many hanging plants and decorative items on shelves could be pulled down by a curious child. The apartment is in excellent, clean condition with a stylish cafe-like balcony, but the listing description is minimal (agent listing) and the NT$68,000 price for Nangang is reasonable for this quality of renovation."}
