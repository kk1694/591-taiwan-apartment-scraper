{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Luxury high-end apartment in a premium building with an opulent marble lobby, designer lounge area, and elevator hall with art installations. The bathroom features modern dual vanity sinks, a freestanding soaking tub, rain shower with glass partition, and dark slate flooring — very high-end finishes throughout. For baby safety, the freestanding bathtub and slippery dark tile bathroom floor are concerns; the large bathroom windows should be checked for secure locks. No interior living space photos were provided (only lobby and bathroom), so full assessment of the unit layout, natural light, and baby-proofing needs is limited."}
