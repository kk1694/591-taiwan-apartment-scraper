{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with marble-style wall tiles, crystal chandelier, smart toilet, glass-enclosed shower, and a fully equipped kitchen with gas stove, inverter fridge, and microwave. The living room has a balcony with visible red metal railings that appear to have wide gaps—a potential safety concern for a crawling baby; the glass sliding doors to the balcony and hard tile floors throughout also need childproofing. The secondary bedroom is quite compact with a single platform bed, and natural light appears limited based on the night-time photos, but the unit is clean and in good condition overall."}
