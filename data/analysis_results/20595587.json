{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained older apartment with a mix of traditional and updated elements. The living room is spacious with polished tile floors, a crystal chandelier, L-shaped sofa, and a balcony with city views providing good natural light; the glass coffee table and balcony sliding doors are potential baby safety concerns. The kitchen is functional with modern-ish dark cabinetry, gas stove, large fridge, and a separate utility balcony with a drum washing machine and gas water heater. Overall clean and livable at 38 ping, but the furnishings and style are dated rather than modern, and the description is just a broker ad template with no real listing details — a red flag suggesting limited transparency."}
