{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Spacious, modern apartment in excellent condition with clean white walls, polished tile floors, recessed lighting, split AC, and contemporary minimalist furniture. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). Very good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows in both living room and bedroom with mountain/city views. For baby safety, the balcony has a sliding glass door that can be kept locked, but the coffee table has sharp corners and the glossy tile floors could be slippery; the open bookshelf could be a climbing hazard for a toddler. At 61.7 ping on the 7th floor of a 9-story building (very likely has elevator), this is a large, well-maintained unit suitable for a family."}
