{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with designer finishes, recessed lighting, quality wood flooring, and sleek built-in cabinetry. The open floor plan with floor-to-ceiling windows provides excellent natural light. For baby safety, the coffee table has rounded edges but the glass sliding doors and low balcony railings visible in images may need childproofing; overall very clean and well-maintained."}
