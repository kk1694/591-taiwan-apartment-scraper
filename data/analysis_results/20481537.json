{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin hillside area, likely near Yangmingshan", "notes": "Very spacious older-style apartment (54 ping) on a hillside with long outdoor staircase access — a major concern for a pregnant woman and later with a stroller. No elevator visible; building is a low-rise 5-story brick structure. Interior is clean with hardwood floors, large windows providing excellent natural light, and mountain views, but fixtures (lighting, AC units, curtains) are dated. The large balcony/terrace doors and open layout are nice but the balcony railings and terrace access would need baby-proofing; the steep hillside stairs leading to the building are a serious practical red flag for daily life with an infant."}
