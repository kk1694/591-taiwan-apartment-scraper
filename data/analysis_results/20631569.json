{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, fully renovated apartment with clean white minimalist design, wall-mounted TV, modern lighting fixtures, air conditioning, and updated appliances including a large refrigerator. The apartment appears very clean with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the raised platform seating area and hard flooring may need padding; no visible balcony railings or stairs in these photos. Being on floor 4 of a 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
