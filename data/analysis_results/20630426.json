{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed LED lighting, large flat-screen TV, leather sofa, and split AC unit. The living area is spacious at 22.83 ping with good natural light from large windows and a sliding glass door leading to a balcony. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp-edged glass coffee table are concerns, and the balcony access via sliding doors should be secured; the overall condition is very clean and the 18-story building on the 4th floor very likely has an elevator."}
