{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a dated, older-style apartment from the 1980s-90s with ornate ceiling moldings, crystal chandeliers, old window-unit AC, and dark wood cabinetry. The bathroom is particularly aged with stained green tiles, an old bathtub, and exposed pipes that pose hygiene and baby safety concerns. Being on the top floor (7F/7F) with 3 balconies and older-style sliding doors with low railings visible through the glass is a significant safety risk for a young child; the overall worn condition, discolored flooring, and lack of modern fixtures make this a poor choice for a couple expecting a baby."}
