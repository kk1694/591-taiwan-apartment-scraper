{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylishly renovated apartment with designer furnishings, open-plan living/dining/kitchen layout, modern white kitchen with island and large Japanese-style fridge, polished concrete floors, and split AC. At 65 ping this is very spacious. Being on 5F/5F (top floor) with no elevator info is a concern for carrying a baby and stroller; the balcony has horizontal railing bars that a toddler could climb, and the concrete floors are hard surfaces for falls. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — clarify layout details, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and elevator access before visiting."}
