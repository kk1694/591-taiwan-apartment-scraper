Well-equipped with appliances including AC, refrigerator, washing machine, and natural gas cooking. Good for a family with a baby — elevator access eliminates stair concerns, the mid-floor location is reasonable, and the unit has a balcony (check railing height/gaps for baby safety). Strong transit access with multiple MRT stations within 500m and parking available."}
