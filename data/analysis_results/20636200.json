{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment from the 1990s with dated fixtures and traditional styling. The interior shows clean white tile floors but older light fixtures and dated decor. The building is 9 floors with elevator access. For baby safety, the unit appears to be single-level with no stairs visible, but the balcony visible in exterior shots would need childproofing. The parking garage image shows exposed pipes and ladders which may indicate the rental includes parking. The unit is sparsely furnished and reasonably clean but shows signs of age with wall discoloration."}
