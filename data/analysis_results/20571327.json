{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated parquet wood flooring, old-style window AC units, and a yellowed tiled kitchen with aging fixtures — clearly not renovated recently. The unit is very spacious (42 ping) and mostly unfurnished with visible water stains on the ceiling, which is a red flag for leaking; being on the top floor (5F/5F) increases this risk. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is good, but the old window-mounted AC and lack of window guards in some rooms are concerns, and the overall dated condition would require significant furnishing and childproofing effort."}
