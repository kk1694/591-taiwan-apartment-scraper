{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern high-rise apartment in a luxury building with impressive lobby and concierge desk. The unit has contemporary finishes, built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, and appears clean and well-maintained. Good natural light from multiple windows with city views. For baby safety: tile floors are easy to clean but hard if baby falls; the glass balcony door and floor-to-ceiling windows should be checked for child locks; no visible stairs or sharp corners. The building has elevator access (14th floor of 24-story building with luxury amenities)."}
