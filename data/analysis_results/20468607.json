{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with minimalist white decor, modern kitchen with induction cooktop, and good natural light from balcony. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that could be a baby safety concern, and the balcony has horizontal railings that a toddler could potentially climb. The space is clean and well-maintained but compact for a family."}
