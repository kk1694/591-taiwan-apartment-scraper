{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated wooden cabinetry, tile floors, and a semi-open kitchen with tiled backsplash. The unit is spacious at 47 ping with at least two bedrooms and built-in wardrobes, but furnishings and fixtures appear to be from the 1990s-2000s era. The raised wooden platform area near the windows and the step-up between rooms could be a tripping hazard for a crawling baby; the unit appears clean but largely unfurnished, and natural light seems decent from the enclosed balcony windows."}
