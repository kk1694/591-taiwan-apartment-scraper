{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with new light-colored laminate flooring, recessed LED lighting, modern built-in cabinetry, and split AC units. Two clean modern bathrooms (one with bathtub, one wet-room style with window). Windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, but the living room has visible stairs suggesting a split-level or loft area which is a concern for a crawling baby. The apartment is spacious at 34.4 ping with good natural light from multiple large windows, and the overall finish is very clean with no visible red flags. Listed through a Japanese real estate agency (Okumura) which may be helpful for foreign tenants."}
