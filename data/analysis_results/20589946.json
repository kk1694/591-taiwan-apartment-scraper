{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with polished marble-look floors, modern white kitchen cabinets, AC, and clean white walls. The bedroom has large sliding glass doors to a balcony with metal railings that appear adequately spaced for baby safety, though the balcony access would need a child gate. Exposed conduit on ceilings is a minor cosmetic issue. The living/kitchen area is compact but clean; the bathroom is visible from the main area. On 5F with no elevator info — at 5F of a 7-story building, no elevator would be a concern for a stroller. Overall a well-maintained, move-in ready unit in Zhongzheng district."}
