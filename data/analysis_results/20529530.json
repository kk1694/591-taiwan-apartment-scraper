{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Clean, modern living room with white walls, wood-look flooring, wall-mounted TV, AC unit, and a chandelier. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency with Japanese services). The glass coffee table with sharp edges and low TV stand could pose baby safety concerns. Only one image available so kitchen, bathroom, and balcony conditions are unknown; the description is minimal (just a promotion ad), which is a slight red flag. At 18.54 ping on the 9th floor of a 13-story building, an elevator is likely but not confirmed."}
