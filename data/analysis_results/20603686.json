{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylish, modern duplex/loft-style apartment with high-end finishes, white minimalist kitchen with wine storage, and artistic decor. Significant baby safety concerns: multiple levels with open stairs lacking railings, split-level design throughout. Good natural light from courtyard windows. Very clean and well-maintained, but the multi-level layout would require extensive baby-proofing."}
