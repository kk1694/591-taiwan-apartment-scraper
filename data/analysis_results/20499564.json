{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Clean but dated apartment with older-style wooden furniture, crown molding, tile floors, and window-unit AC in the living room (split AC in bedroom). The living room is spacious with decent natural light from a balcony door, and the kitchen has older blue cabinets with a Sanyo fridge. For baby safety, the glass-top coffee table with sharp corners is a concern, the balcony access door needs child-proofing, and the tile floors are hard but easy to clean; no stairs visible, which is good. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), offering little useful detail about the property itself."}
