{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "High-end luxury apartment with designer finishes, herringbone dark wood flooring, recessed lighting, and premium furnishings including a modern platform bed and sleek sofa. The glass-walled bathroom in the master bedroom and decorative slatted room divider give it a boutique-hotel feel. For baby safety, the metal-frame coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the glass bathroom partition could be a concern; however, the spacious open layout with no stairs is a plus. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light, and the unit appears very clean and well-maintained, though the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and kitchen/bathroom count."}
