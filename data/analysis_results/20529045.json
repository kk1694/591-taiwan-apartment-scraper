{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a newly renovated modern apartment in excellent condition with polished marble-look flooring, modern kitchen with gas stove and glass backsplash, and a contemporary bathroom with glass shower partition. Good natural light from large windows with balcony access on a high floor (10F). For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings that appear standard height but would need childproofing; the hard tile floors throughout and glass shower door could pose risks, but no stairs or sharp corners are visible. Overall very clean and move-in ready."}
