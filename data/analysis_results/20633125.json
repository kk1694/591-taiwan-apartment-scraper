{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern Scandinavian-style finishes, light wood flooring, and clean white walls. The living area has ample space and rounded furniture edges which is good for baby safety, though the open staircase area visible in image 2 would need a baby gate. The kitchen shows some contrast - main cooking area appears older with traditional tile and window AC unit, while dining area is newly renovated. Good natural light from windows and balcony. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller."}
