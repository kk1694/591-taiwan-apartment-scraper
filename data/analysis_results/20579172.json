{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with sleek white finishes, recessed LED lighting, central air conditioning, and high-gloss tile flooring. The open-plan living/dining/kitchen area is spacious and clean with built-in cabinetry and a sliding partition to a separate room. For baby safety, the polished tile floors are very slippery, the balcony with glass sliding doors needs child-proofing, and the clear acrylic dining chairs have hard edges; however the space is largely open with few sharp corners and excellent natural light from large windows. The 7th floor in a 10-story building very likely has an elevator, and the unit appears to be in excellent, move-in ready condition via An-Ho Real Estate agency."}
