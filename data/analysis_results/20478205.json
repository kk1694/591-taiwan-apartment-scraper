{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with clean finishes, wood-look flooring, updated kitchen with stainless steel appliances and marble countertops. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners, balcony railings appear standard height but access doors should be secured; overall a safe layout with no visible stairs."}
