{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with recessed ceiling lighting, large living room with sectional sofa, two bedrooms with dark hardwood floors, and a traditional tatami room. Clean condition with good natural light through large windows. Baby safety considerations: no visible dangerous balcony railings, but the glass TV stand and low furniture may need childproofing; the tatami room would be ideal as a safe play area for a baby."}
