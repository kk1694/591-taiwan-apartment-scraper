{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang, near Nangang Software Park (distinctive oval-shaped building visible from window)", "notes": "Spacious and modern apartment in excellent condition with glossy tile floors, recessed LED lighting, built-in ceiling AC, and a well-equipped kitchen with glass backsplash, gas stove, and range hood. The unit is very clean and mostly unfurnished, offering great natural light through large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors with balcony access. For baby safety, the balcony doors and railings should be checked in person, and the open floor plan with smooth tile floors is generally baby-friendly though the hard tile surface and glass doors warrant childproofing. The 15-story building on floor 5 almost certainly has an elevator, and the view overlooks what appears to be the FLUX building near Nangang Software Park."}
