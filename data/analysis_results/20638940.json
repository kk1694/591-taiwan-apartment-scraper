{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white finishes, open kitchen with washer and refrigerator, and good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. The balcony has secure railings, but being on the 7th/top floor of the building means potential baby safety concerns with the balcony access; no significant sharp corners visible. Space appears compact but efficiently designed."}
