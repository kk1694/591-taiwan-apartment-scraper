{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with clean wood laminate flooring, recessed lighting, and contemporary furnishings. The open layout with spacious living area is generally baby-friendly with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access, though the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need childproofing. Good natural light from multiple windows, clean condition overall; appears to be a quality 2-bedroom unit in a 17-floor building which almost certainly has an elevator."}
