{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Upscale duplex apartment with modern finishes including herringbone wood flooring, marble accent walls, large wall-mounted TV, modern white kitchen, and floor-to-ceiling windows with good natural light and green views. Baby safety concerns include an internal staircase (visible in image 3) leading to a second level which would need gating, a balcony accessible from the bedroom with railing that should be checked for child safety, and glass coffee table with sharp edges. The space is very large at 66 ping, clean, and well-furnished, but the duplex layout with stairs is a notable consideration for a family with a baby."}
