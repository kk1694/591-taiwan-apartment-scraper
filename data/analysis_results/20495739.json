{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Above PX Mart (全聯福利中心), Shilin District", "notes": "This is an older walk-up building (7 floors, no visible elevator) located above a PX Mart supermarket. The building exterior shows significant age with weathered facades and traditional balcony railings. No interior photos were provided, making it impossible to assess baby safety concerns, cleanliness, or natural light inside the unit. The street-level commercial activity and lack of interior images are red flags for a family viewing."}
