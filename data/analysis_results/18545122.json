{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District, near riverside park", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with minimalist Japanese-Scandinavian aesthetic, featuring clean white tile floors, stylish wooden furniture, stone accent wall, and excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a river and green park area. The 8th floor unit in a 15-story building very likely has an elevator and the flat layout with no visible stairs is baby-friendly, though the large windows would need childproofing once the baby becomes mobile. The listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), but the photos show an immaculately clean, move-in ready space that would be very suitable for a young family."}
