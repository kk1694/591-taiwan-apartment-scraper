{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern wood-grain cabinetry, laminate flooring, and split AC. Clean condition with good natural light from windows. The decorative screen divider has openings that could be a minor concern for curious toddlers, but overall the flat layout with no visible stairs is baby-friendly. The open kitchen gas stove would need child safety gates."}
