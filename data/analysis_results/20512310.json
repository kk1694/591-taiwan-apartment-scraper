{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment in a 15-floor building (3F) with recessed lighting, white glossy cabinetry, LG refrigerator, built-in microwave, and a breakfast bar with bar stools. The space appears well-maintained with polished tile floors, a video intercom system, and ample entryway storage. For baby safety, the red bar stools are tall and unstable which would need to be removed, and the glass coffee table has sharp corners; however, the flat layout with no visible stairs is a plus. Natural light appears limited based on the photos showing mostly artificial lighting, and no bedroom or bathroom images were provided which is a notable gap."}
