{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District, near Taipei 101", "notes": "Spacious 38-ping apartment in a modern high-rise building with elevator, featuring a well-equipped kitchen with dining area, large living room with L-shaped sofa, AC, and a balcony with a view of Taipei 101. Interior is clean but dated with older-style fixtures, crown molding, and light wood furniture from the early 2000s. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, the balcony access visible in the living room should be checked for secure railings, and windows in the bedroom appear to have adequate frames; the tiled floors throughout are easy to clean but slippery for a crawling baby."}
