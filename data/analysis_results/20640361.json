{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This is a very dated, likely commercial or office-converted space on the 1st floor of an older 4-story building with no elevator. It has fluorescent grid ceiling lights, green marble floor tiles, office swivel chairs, and walls showing significant aging and staining — strongly resembling a former office rather than a residential apartment. The kitchen is small and outdated with old Sakura appliances. For a baby, concerns include the hard stone flooring, lack of clear bedroom separation, peeling wall surfaces, poor natural light (windows appear frosted/blocked), and the overall institutional feel making it unsuitable as a family home."}
