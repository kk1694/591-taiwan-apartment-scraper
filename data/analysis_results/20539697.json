{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern open kitchen, wood-tone cabinetry, glass-enclosed shower, and clean light-grey laminate flooring throughout. The unit appears spacious at 23 ping with multiple rooms, though some areas have low ceiling beams that suggest a partially converted loft-style layout. For baby safety, the low built-in storage cubbies and open shelving have accessible sharp corners, and the glass shower partition in the bathroom would need child-proofing; natural light appears limited with only small windows visible in the kitchen area."}
