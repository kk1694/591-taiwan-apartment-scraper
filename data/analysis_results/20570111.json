{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is a luxury duplex/loft (樓中樓) unit on the 13th floor with high-end finishes including Italian leather sofa, Simmons mattress, Samsung smart lock, Philips 70-inch 4K TV, and designer lighting. The unit has internal stairs connecting two levels, which is a significant baby safety concern — the open staircase has no visible baby gate and the steps appear to also function as shoe storage. The large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light but the mezzanine level with mirrors and open railings would need childproofing. Overall very clean and stylishly decorated but the split-level layout is not ideal for a family with a baby."}
