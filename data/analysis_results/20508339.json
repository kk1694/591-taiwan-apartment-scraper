{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Dated 1990s-style duplex penthouse (7F/7F) with interior staircase that poses a significant safety hazard for babies and toddlers. The wallpaper shows visible water staining and wear, fixtures are outdated, and the overall decor is quite old-fashioned. Natural light is decent through multiple windows, but the space requires baby-proofing and has generally aged finishes."}
