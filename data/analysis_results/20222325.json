{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with wood-look flooring, stylish light fixtures, open-plan living/dining/kitchen layout, wall-mounted AC, large flat-screen TV, and a fully equipped kitchen with gas stove, large refrigerator, and marble countertop. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony with sliding doors should be checked for secure child locks. Overall very clean and bright condition with good natural light from the balcony windows; the description is minimal (just an agent promo) so no red flags beyond the lack of detail — confirm layout and bedroom count in person."}
