{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with modern fixtures including recessed ceiling lighting, large TV, and updated white kitchen with modern appliances. Good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety: the metal railing/gate visible in the balcony area and some decorative iron elements may need childproofing; the glass coffee table and low furniture have some sharp corners to address. Being on the top floor (5F/5F) without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller."}
