{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "Very modern, brand-new condition unfurnished apartment in a high-rise building (6F/24F, certainly has elevator). Polished white tile floors, recessed LED lighting, wall-mounted AC, modern bathroom with rain shower and glass partition. Extremely clean and move-in ready. For baby safety: no balcony visible (windows appear sealed/non-opening large panes), smooth floors are easy to clean but slippery, glass shower partition in bathroom needs child-proofing. Excellent natural light from large corner windows in bedroom. Note: unit is completely empty/unfurnished so you will need to furnish entirely; the listing description is mostly a broker advertisement with minimal property details, which is a minor red flag for transparency."}
