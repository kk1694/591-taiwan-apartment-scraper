{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with stylish marble accent wall, LED ambient lighting, leather sofa, and clean glossy tile floors throughout. The kitchen is compact but functional with glass backsplash, gas stove, and ample storage. Good natural light from large windows with mountain/hillside views; the 9th floor location and building style strongly suggest elevator access. For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery, the small bar-height dining area with stools could be a tipping hazard, and the balcony/window areas would need child locks; no visible stairs or dangerous railings inside the unit."}
