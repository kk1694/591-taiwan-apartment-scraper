{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment in very clean condition with new tile and wood-laminate flooring, fresh white walls, modern AC units in each room, and LED ceiling lights. The space is spacious at 50 ping with multiple rooms; windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, and the flat single-level layout with no visible stairs is ideal for a family with a baby. However, the listing is completely unfurnished (no kitchen, bathroom not shown) and the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — verify full amenities, and the covered ground-floor entrance area with metal grating and drainage grates suggests this may be a lower floor or townhouse-style unit."}
