{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean white/grey walls, light wood flooring, recessed lighting, and contemporary furnishings including a leather sofa and modern dining set. The unit has multiple rooms (master bedroom, second bedroom/study, living area, and a utility room) with good natural light from large black-framed windows. For baby safety, the balcony accessible from the living room has floor-to-ceiling glass sliding doors that should be secured; the wooden bookshelf in the utility room could be a tipping hazard and should be anchored to the wall. Overall very clean and move-in ready condition at 22 ping in Zhongzheng district; the 3F/11F building almost certainly has an elevator."}
