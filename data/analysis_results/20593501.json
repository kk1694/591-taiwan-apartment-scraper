{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious, well-maintained apartment with elegant crystal chandeliers, built-in cabinetry, polished tile floors, and high-end furnishings. The space is very clean with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the glass display cabinets with sharp corners and low glass shelving units may need childproofing; no visible balcony railings or stairs shown but floor-to-ceiling windows require attention. Being on 8F of 14F strongly suggests elevator access."}
