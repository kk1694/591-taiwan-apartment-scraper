{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with floor-to-ceiling windows, LED cove lighting, sleek built-in cabinetry, and quality finishes throughout. Excellent natural light. For baby safety, the balcony has standard railings visible through the large windows - would need baby gates; the glass coffee table and display cabinet with glass shelves are potential hazards. The building exterior shows a newer 7-story construction with secure entry but no visible elevator from the outside."}
