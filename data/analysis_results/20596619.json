{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with new light wood laminate flooring, modern recessed and panel lighting, and fresh white walls. The space is very spacious at 30 ping with an open layout and appears clean, but it is completely empty with no furniture or appliances — exposed wires and cables along walls are a baby safety concern. At 3F of a 5-story walkup building with no elevator, carrying a stroller and baby up stairs daily would be inconvenient; windows have security grilles which are good for safety, and natural light appears moderate from the balcony-side windows."}
