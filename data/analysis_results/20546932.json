{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean light wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, and a sleek minimalist design. The spacious living area has a leather sofa, wall-mounted TV, small dining area, and separate bedrooms visible through doorways — the layout is open and baby-friendly with no visible stairs, sharp corners are minimal, and the flat flooring throughout is safe for crawling. Natural light appears moderate (2F with trees outside the windows), and the 17-floor building almost certainly has an elevator; the unit is very clean and well-maintained, though the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — verify details directly with the agent (柏林不動產)."}
