{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Charming, well-decorated 1F unit with a European-vintage aesthetic, white floors, and a loft-style mezzanine sleeping area accessed by stairs. Major baby safety concern: the loft has metal railings with wide gaps that a child could slip through, and the steep stairs to the mezzanine are hazardous for a crawling baby or toddler. The space is clean with good natural light from tall windows, but the multi-level layout with open loft makes it poorly suited for a family with a baby."}
