{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with fresh white walls, new wood-grain laminate flooring, modern LED ceiling lights, and split AC units in multiple rooms. The spacious living area has large sliding glass doors/windows, a separate kitchen with tiled floors, and a bedroom with built-in floor-to-ceiling wardrobes. For baby safety, the flat open layout with no stairs is good, but the large sliding glass doors to what appears to be a balcony would need child-proofing; the kitchen has a raised threshold/step at the doorway that could be a trip hazard. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — worth confirming details directly with the agent."}
