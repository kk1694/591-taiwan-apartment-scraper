{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Stylishly renovated apartment with industrial-modern aesthetic featuring track lighting, exposed conduit, wooden flooring, and clean minimalist design. The living room has a balcony with metal railings and sliding glass doors which would need a baby gate; the bedroom has windows with blinds and a glass partition wall leading to what appears to be a bathroom area. Good natural light from multiple windows. At 3F/4F in a low-rise walk-up building with no elevator, carrying a stroller up stairs daily would be a significant inconvenience for parents with a baby."}
