{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with polished hardwood floors, recessed lighting, and elegant curved ceiling details. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. For baby safety, the balcony railings appear adequate height but would need childproofing; the open floor plan and lack of stairs is good, but sharp corners on built-in wooden cabinetry and glass display shelves should be padded. Clean condition with high-end finishes suitable for a family."}
