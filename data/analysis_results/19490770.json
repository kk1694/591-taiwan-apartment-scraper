{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment on 11F with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, AC, and a bright open-plan layout with sliding glass doors to a balcony. The space appears to be a large studio or 1-bedroom with a separate bedroom visible through glass partitions; it includes a kitchenette with fridge, washing machine, and range hood. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings with gaps that would need childproofing, and the large wooden desk/cabinet pieces have some sharp corners; overall the flat floors and open layout are good for a crawling baby. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on lease terms and actual room count."}
