{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District, near Dunhua South Road area", "notes": "Spacious and recently renovated unfurnished apartment with modern wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, and updated bathrooms featuring rain showers, glass partitions, and bidet toilets. The 17-story building in a prime Da'an commercial area strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the large sliding glass balcony doors will need child locks, and the glass shower partitions in both bathrooms should be monitored; the open floor plan is otherwise baby-friendly with no visible stairs or sharp built-in corners. The unit is very clean and move-in ready, with good natural light from the balcony side and built-in closet storage, though the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request full details on layout and amenities."}
