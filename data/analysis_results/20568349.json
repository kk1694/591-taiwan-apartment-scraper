{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment in a high-rise building (6F/13F) in Wenshan district, managed by Tuo An Real Estate. The unit features a spacious living room with large sliding glass doors to a balcony, a well-equipped kitchen with modern white cabinetry and a large stainless steel refrigerator, and at least two bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and AC units. For baby safety, the balcony has glass railings with metal frames that appear adequately spaced, but the floor-to-ceiling windows in bedrooms could be a concern; the coffee table in the living room has sharp corners. Overall the apartment is clean, bright with good natural light, and in good condition — a suitable family home at ~30 ping with no major red flags, though the description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder)."}
