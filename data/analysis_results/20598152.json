{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Mingde Elementary School (明德國小)", "notes": "Upscale, well-renovated apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, wood-look flooring, and contemporary furniture. The unit is very clean with good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the living room has a low round coffee table with rounded edges, but the raised platform area in one room could be a fall hazard. Located near a school which is convenient for future. Being on 7th floor of a 10-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
