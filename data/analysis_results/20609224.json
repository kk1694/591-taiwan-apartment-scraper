{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This space has a strong commercial/office aesthetic with exposed ceiling pipes, track lighting, industrial-style fixtures, and wall-mounted hooks and shelving that suggest prior use as a studio or retail space rather than a residential apartment. While it has been renovated with modern wood-look flooring, an accent blue wall, LED shelf lighting, and an open kitchen area, the layout and fixtures are not residential in nature. For a couple with a baby, the exposed pipes on the ceiling, lack of visible bedrooms or bathroom, and overall commercial feel are red flags; the description text is also just an agent advertisement with no real listing details."}
