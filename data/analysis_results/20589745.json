{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Daan MRT Station (大安站 Exit 6)", "notes": "Spacious 60-ping unfurnished apartment with marble flooring in the living area and hardwood flooring in the bedrooms. The unit is clean but dated with older-style window-unit and split AC, crown molding, and dark wood built-in dividers from the 1990s-2000s era. Good natural light from large bay windows. At 12F/17F in Da'an district, the building almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the marble floors are very slippery and hard — a major concern for a crawling/toddling child; the open wood-and-glass partition has sharp corners that would need padding. No balcony visible in photos, which is actually a positive for child safety."}
