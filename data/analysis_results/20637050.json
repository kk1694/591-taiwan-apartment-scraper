{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with designer finishes including recessed lighting, wood paneling, and quality fixtures. Kitchen features built-in appliances and a breakfast bar. The glass coffee table with sharp corners and glass balcony doors are potential baby safety concerns that would need childproofing. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows, and the unit appears very clean and well-maintained."}
