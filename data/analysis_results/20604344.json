{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a dated 1980s-90s era apartment with heavy wood paneling throughout the living area, dark marble-pattern tile floors, and older parquet wood flooring in the bedrooms. The unit is spacious at 52 ping with multiple rooms, wall-mounted AC units, and built-in wooden cabinetry, but the overall condition is worn and would need significant updating. For baby safety, the balcony has low railings visible in image 2, the hard marble and parquet floors are slippery, and exposed cables on the floor in the bedroom (image 3) are a hazard; the 3rd-floor walkup with no elevator would also be difficult with a stroller and newborn."}
