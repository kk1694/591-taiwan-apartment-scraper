{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment in excellent condition with sleek minimalist design, built-in LED lighting, central AC, and quality finishes. The space appears clean and well-maintained with an open kitchen featuring a breakfast bar. For baby safety, the balcony with floor-to-ceiling glass doors requires attention, and the bar stools could be a climbing hazard; the apartment has no visible stairs and corners appear rounded. Good natural light from the balcony area on the 16th floor of a newer building."}
