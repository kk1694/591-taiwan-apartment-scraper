{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in a contemporary 8-story building with high-end Bosch appliances, sleek dark cabinetry, wood flooring, and recessed lighting throughout. The balcony has proper metal railings visible from kitchen; corners appear rounded on furniture. Natural light is limited due to narrow window configuration but interior is very clean and well-maintained. Good choice for a family with baby."}
