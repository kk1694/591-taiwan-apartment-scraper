{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Dated 1990s-era apartment in a tall residential tower with older fixtures and furniture - not modern but clean and functional. The living room has large sliding glass doors to a balcony with proper railings; baby safety concerns include the hard tile floors throughout and balcony access that would need childproofing. Good natural light from multiple windows, spacious at 51 ping with adequate storage, though the kitchen and furnishings show their age."}
