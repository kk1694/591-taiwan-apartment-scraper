{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern studio-style apartment in clean condition with updated kitchen (Toshiba fridge, microwave, range hood, glass backsplash), built-in cabinetry, and recessed lighting. The bedroom area is separated by a glass partition creating a semi-open layout which feels compact for a couple with a baby. The balcony has horizontal metal railings with gaps that are a significant baby safety concern once the child becomes mobile, and the glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners. Natural light is decent from the floor-to-ceiling balcony door but the 2F position among trees may limit direct sunlight; the 13-story building very likely has an elevator."}
