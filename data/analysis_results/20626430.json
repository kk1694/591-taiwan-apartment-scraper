{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained modern apartment with high-end finishes including recessed ceiling lighting, decorative wallpaper, hardwood flooring in bedroom, and a large U-shaped kitchen with gas stove and ample counter space. Bathroom features both a bathtub and separate glass-enclosed shower. For baby safety, the smooth tile flooring in the living room is good, but the glass shower partition and bathtub in the bathroom would need child-proofing; no dangerous balcony railings visible in photos. The apartment appears very clean with good natural light from windows, and at 63 ping it offers generous space for a growing family."}
