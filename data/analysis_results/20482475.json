{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious top-floor duplex apartment with polished hardwood floors throughout and good natural light from multiple windows. Major baby safety concern: the unit has internal stairs between floors with no visible safety gate, which is hazardous for toddlers. The built-in cabinetry and fixtures appear dated (traditional Taiwanese style), and being on the 7th/top floor may mean summer heat issues; overall clean but not modernly renovated."}
