{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with designer finishes including wood-panel ceilings, white brick accent wall, recessed lighting, and high-end built-in cabinetry. The kitchen has a raised platform accessed by open stairs without railings which is a significant baby safety hazard; the decorative fireplace area and glass shelving also pose risks for a crawling toddler. Good natural light from large windows with balcony access on the 10th floor; the walk-in closet and spacious bedroom with hardwood floors are excellent, but the split-level layout with stairs makes this apartment challenging for baby-proofing."}
