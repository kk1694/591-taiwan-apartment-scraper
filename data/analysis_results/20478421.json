{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with high-quality finishes including recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and contemporary kitchen with island. The building appears to be a newer mid-rise with elevator (7-story building). Baby safety concerns include the glass coffee table with sharp corners, balcony access in bedroom, and the internal staircase/mezzanine visible in the living room which would need gates. Good natural light from large windows."}
