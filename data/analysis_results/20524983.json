{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated spacious duplex-style apartment with high ceilings, marble-look flooring, modern pink kitchen with galley layout, and floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors in bedrooms providing excellent natural light. Baby safety concerns include the balcony with low railing visible in images 4 and 5, the double-height living room area which may have a loft/staircase not shown, and the slippery-looking polished tile floors. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) with no confirmed elevator is a significant concern for carrying a stroller and baby gear; managed by HOYUAN Real Estate Agency which caters to foreigners, but the listing description is essentially empty (just an ad promo), which is a minor red flag."}
