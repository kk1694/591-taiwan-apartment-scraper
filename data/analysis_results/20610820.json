{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in clean, modern condition with grey laminate flooring, recessed LED lighting, split AC units, and white cabinetry throughout. The open-plan living area includes a kitchenette with washing machine and a spacious bedroom with desk. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need padding, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows/sliding doors in the living room should be checked for secure locks; no visible balcony or stairs which is positive. Natural light appears limited as windows seem to face a light well or enclosed area, but the unit is very clean and well-maintained. Listed via Dingli Rental Service agent; the description is minimal (just an agent ad), so details on layout and amenities are sparse — worth confirming number of rooms and bathroom condition in person."}
