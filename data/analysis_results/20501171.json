{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is a duplex/loft-style apartment with internal stairs and cable railings that pose significant safety concerns for a crawling baby or toddler. The open stairwell with horizontal cable railings is a major hazard. The unit features modern finishes including hardwood floors and updated bathroom, but the multi-level layout with open areas between floors makes it unsuitable for a family with a young child."}
