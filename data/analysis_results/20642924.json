{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Traditional Taiwanese apartment with dated wooden furniture and fixtures from likely the 1990s-2000s. Clean and well-maintained but not modern. For baby safety: the ornate carved wooden furniture has sharp corners, low coffee table could be a hazard, and the heavy cabinet doors pose pinch risks. Natural light appears limited with small windows. The apartment is spacious at 23 ping with separate living room, bedroom, dining area, and kitchen."}
