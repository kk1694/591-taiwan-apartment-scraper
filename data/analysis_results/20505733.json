{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious 50-ping apartment with a mix of older and renovated elements: the living room has classic parquet flooring and dated light fixtures, while bedrooms have newer laminate flooring and the bathroom is fully renovated with modern glass shower partition and contemporary toilet. Balconies have horizontal railings with moderate gaps that would need baby-proofing, and the sliding glass doors to the balcony are a concern for a crawling child. Good natural light from large windows in multiple rooms, and the overall condition is clean with ample space for a growing family."}
