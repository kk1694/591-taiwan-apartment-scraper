{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Upscale, modern apartment with high-end finishes including hardwood floors, recessed lighting, marble countertops, large sectional sofa, and floor-to-ceiling windows with roller blinds. The living room is spacious with good natural light, and there are at least two bedrooms plus a tea/dining room. Baby safety concerns include the glass coffee table with sharp corners, heavy rustic wooden tea table and benches, and being on the top floor (4F/4F) with no confirmed elevator — climbing stairs with a stroller could be challenging. The listing description is minimal (just a promotional blurb), which is a minor red flag; however, it is managed by UR HOUSE, a foreigner-friendly rental agency, which is a plus."}
