{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment with marble-style accent wall, recessed LED lighting, crystal chandelier, and contemporary built-in furniture. The living room has large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light, and the bedroom features a built-in platform bed with wardrobe. For baby safety, the balcony access in the living room should be monitored, but overall the space appears clean with no visible sharp corners or hazards. Being on the 10th floor of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
