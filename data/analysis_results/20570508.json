{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, spacious apartment with clean white walls, polished tile floors, recessed LED lighting, and contemporary furnishings including an L-shaped sofa set, dining table, and large TV. The 18-story building on the 6th floor almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the hard tile floors are slippery and would need rugs/mats; furniture corners on the coffee table and dining set are relatively rounded but the open layout is spacious which is good for a crawling baby. Good natural light from large curtained windows, and the unit appears very clean and move-in ready, though only living room photos are shown — no kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom details are visible, which is a red flag worth investigating."}
