{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near a tree-lined boulevard", "notes": "This is a dated but clean apartment in a 19-floor building with what appears to be renovated but aging interior finishes. The living room has built-in TV cabinetry, white tile floors, and furniture still wrapped in plastic, suggesting it may have been vacant; a window-unit AC and crystal chandelier give a mixed old/new feel. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and visible balcony area with older-style railings and a window AC unit are concerns, and the glass partition near the hallway could also be a hazard; however, the 7th floor view from a wide boulevard suggests decent natural light and ventilation."}
