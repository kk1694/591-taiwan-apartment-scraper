{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Da'an Station", "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with modern kitchen appliances, AC, and washer/dryer. The bedroom has padded corner cushions already installed which is good for baby safety. Tile floors throughout are easy to clean but hard for falls; windows have low sills that would need childproofing. Good natural light from multiple windows on high floor (12F in 14F building almost certainly has elevator)."}
