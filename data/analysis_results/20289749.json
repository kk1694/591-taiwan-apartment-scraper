{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated, high-end apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, dark marble-style tile floors in living areas, light wood flooring in bedrooms, and a sleek white kitchen with gas stove. Very clean and spacious at 65 ping. For baby safety, the hard tile floors may need rugs, and the large mirrored wall in the bedroom could be a concern; the balcony visible from kitchen appears to have secure railings. Good natural light from multiple windows."}
