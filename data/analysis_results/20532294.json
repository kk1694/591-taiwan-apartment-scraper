{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment in Da'an with clean polished tile floors, wall-mounted AC units in multiple rooms, built-in sliding-door wardrobe in the bedroom, and a decorative wallpaper accent wall in the living area. The balcony has sliding glass doors with curtains providing decent natural light. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout could be slippery and the marble table has sharp corners that would need padding; the balcony access door should be secured with a child lock once the baby is mobile. The unit appears clean and recently refreshed but is completely empty, so furnishing costs should be factored in."}
