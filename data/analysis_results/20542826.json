{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment in a 15-floor building with recessed lighting, built-in ceiling AC, clean white tile floors, LG refrigerator, and an intercom/video doorphone system. The living room has sliding glass doors to a balcony which would need baby-proofing; the kitchen has a breakfast bar with tall bar stools that are unstable for a child. The space appears clean and well-maintained but the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), and with only 5 photos showing mainly the kitchen/entry/living room, the bedroom and bathroom are not shown — would need to verify full layout and condition in person."}
