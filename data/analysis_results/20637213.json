{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a beautifully renovated duplex (樓中樓) apartment in Wanhua with high-end finishes including wood-panel walls, marble countertops, Philips 70-inch 4K TV, LG washer-dryer, Panasonic bidet toilet, Simmons mattress, and upgraded black-frame laminated glass windows with a planted balcony. Baby safety concerns include the duplex layout with internal stairs between levels, and the balcony has greenery but railing height should be verified in person. Excellent natural light from large windows, very clean and well-maintained condition, though the kitchen is compact and the duplex stairs are a notable concern for a toddler once mobile."}
