{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with European/Victorian-style decor including crystal chandelier, tufted sofa, floral wallpaper, and ornate furniture — not modern but in good condition. The building hallway (image 4) shows marble-clad walls and a security door, suggesting a managed building with elevator access on the 12th floor. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp metal legs, the bathroom is compact with a clawfoot bathtub that could be slippery, and window shutters appear secure; good natural light from multiple windows but the cluttered bathroom and small spaces may need childproofing. Being on the top floor (12F/12F) could mean potential roof leak or heat issues."}
