{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment in excellent condition with contemporary furniture, sleek white kitchen with marble backsplash, and modern appliances including AC units in all rooms. The unit has a balcony with glass sliding doors and appears to be in a newer high-rise building (7F/23F strongly suggests elevator). For baby safety: the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors that should remain locked, furniture has rounded edges, and the tile floors are smooth and easy to clean. Good natural light from windows with adjustable blinds."}
