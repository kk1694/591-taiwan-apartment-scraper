At least 2 bedrooms plus a tatami-style room that could serve as a nursery. The raised tatami platform in the third room is a minor fall hazard for a crawling baby and would need a gate or padding. Large windows with floor-to-ceiling curtains provide good natural light; the balcony area visible from the living room should be checked for secure railings. Overall clean and spacious at 24 ping, suitable for a small family in Zhongshan district."}
