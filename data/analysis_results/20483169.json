{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious and well-renovated apartment with polished tile floors in living/dining areas and wood flooring in bedrooms. At least 3 bedrooms visible including a large master with built-in wardrobes, a smaller room with built-in shelving (potential nursery), and another bedroom with desk. Modern open kitchen with large refrigerator and half-wall divider. The living room has large sliding glass doors to a balcony which would need childproofing; the polished tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby. Good natural light in all rooms, clean condition throughout, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent promo) which is a minor red flag."}
