{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with sleek built-in cabinetry, recessed LED lighting, decorative stone wall feature, and contemporary furniture. The unit is spacious (55 ping) with large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the furniture has mostly rounded edges though the glass coffee table and dining chairs with metal legs could pose minor concerns; no visible balcony railings or stairs in these photos. Overall extremely clean and well-maintained, suitable for a family."}
