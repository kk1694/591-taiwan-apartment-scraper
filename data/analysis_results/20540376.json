{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment with good natural light from multiple large windows, split AC units, and wood laminate flooring. One bedroom has notable wall staining/damage that needs attention before move-in. For baby safety, the balcony visible through the windows has railings but would need childproofing; no stairs visible and corners appear rounded. Overall clean and spacious living area but the bedroom wall condition is a concern."}
