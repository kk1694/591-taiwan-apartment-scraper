{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Very well-renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, wood-look flooring, modern furniture, and split AC units. The spacious living room and bedrooms are clean and stylishly furnished. Being on the top floor (7F/7F) is a concern for heat and potential leaks, but the building exterior appears to be a modern high-rise with likely elevator access. For baby safety, the round coffee table edges and low window sills should be noted, but overall the flat surfaces and lack of visible stairs on this floor are positive; however, the listing description is minimal (just a broker ad) which is a slight red flag for transparency."}
