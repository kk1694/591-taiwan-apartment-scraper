{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious older-style apartment with dated wood cabinetry and marble/hardwood flooring from the 1990s-2000s era. The unit is clean and well-maintained but has an outdated aesthetic with ornate ceiling treatments and chandeliers. For baby safety, the hard marble flooring in the entryway and sharp wooden cabinet corners would need padding; the unit appears to be a single level with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings."}
