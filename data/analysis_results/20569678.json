{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older Shilin apartment on 1F with mixed condition — the living area has newer light wood laminate flooring and fresh paint but retains dated dark wood furniture, iron window grilles, and a traditional round dining table; the bedroom has original tile flooring and older built-in wardrobes. Being on the first floor is convenient with a stroller but the staircase railing visible in image 2 and the glass display cabinet with sharp edges are baby safety concerns. Natural light appears limited due to frosted/patterned security windows, and the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — visit in person to verify actual room count and condition."}
