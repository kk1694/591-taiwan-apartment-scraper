{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment in a high-rise building (4F/26F) managed by UR House, a foreigner-friendly rental agency. The unit features clean white/beige finishes, recessed lighting, an L-shaped leather sofa, built-in wardrobes in two bedrooms, and a modern kitchen with induction cooktop, microwave, and refrigerator. For baby safety, the metal-frame coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the glossy tile floors are very slippery; however, the unit appears to be single-level with no stairs, and no balcony is visible in the photos. Natural light appears limited based on the bedroom window shown, but the overall condition is excellent and very clean."}
