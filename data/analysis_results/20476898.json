{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Modern apartment in a high-end building with upscale common areas including a stylish lobby lounge, communal dining area, and well-equipped fitness center. The unit itself has recessed LED lighting, marble-style tile floors, leather sofa, and air conditioning. The building clearly has an elevator given the luxury amenities and 7-floor structure. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners is a concern; the windows appear to have secure frames. Natural light is decent with multiple windows, though the view faces adjacent buildings. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad), so interior details like full layout and kitchen/bathroom condition are unknown."}
