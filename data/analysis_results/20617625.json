{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with sleek white cabinetry, recessed lighting, induction cooktop, glass backsplash, and contemporary furniture. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), suggesting it is in a newer building likely with elevator (10-floor building on 4F). For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp-cornered marble coffee tables would need padding; no balcony or staircase hazards are visible in the photos. The space appears clean and bright with good natural light from curtained windows, though the open kitchen layout means the cooktop area would need baby-proofing."}
