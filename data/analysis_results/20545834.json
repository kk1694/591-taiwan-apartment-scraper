{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with polished tile floors, modern Samsung fridge, washing machine, induction cooktop, and split AC units. The enclosed balcony with large bay windows provides good natural light and is safely enclosed with full-height glass. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the bedroom has a sliding glass door to what appears to be a small balcony that would need a child lock; the slippery polished tile floors may also be a concern for a crawling baby. At 4F with no elevator info visible, climbing stairs with a stroller could be an issue if there is no elevator."}
