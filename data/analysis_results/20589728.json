{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Spacious, well-renovated apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, marble TV console, and updated kitchen with gas stove and large refrigerator. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), suggesting foreigner-friendly landlord. The unit is very clean with smooth tile floors and no visible stairs, which is good for baby safety; however, the large windows sit fairly low and the balcony area with louvered door would need childproofing. At 52 ping on the 11th floor of a 12-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator and offers good natural light from multiple windows."}
