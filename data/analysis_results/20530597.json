{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 30-ping apartment with warm hardwood floors throughout, modern built-in shelving, recessed lighting, AC units, and a well-organized walk-in closet with mirrored doors. The living area is large and open with good natural light from sizable windows. For baby safety, the open shelving units have sharp corners that would need padding, and the decorative wooden lattice partition could be a climbing hazard for a toddler; however the flat layout with no stairs is a plus. Being on the top floor (7F/7F) with no confirmed elevator is a concern for stroller access, and the listing description is minimal (just an agent promotion), which is a minor red flag."}
