{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with open floor plan, hardwood floors, recessed lighting, and contemporary furnishings. Very clean condition with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: the bar stools are a concern, and the glass shelving/partitions would need childproofing; the open layout with minimal sharp corners is otherwise favorable. Managed by UR HOUSE rental services, a 13-floor building on 2F likely has elevator access."}
