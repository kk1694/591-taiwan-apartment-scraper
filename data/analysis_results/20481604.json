{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment with dated 1990s-style decor including ornate ceiling moldings, marble and laminate flooring, and older window AC units. The space is very clean with abundant natural light from multiple large windows. Good for baby safety as there are no visible stairs or sharp corners, but the hard marble/tile floors in the living area would require rugs for a crawling baby."}
