{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with new fixtures, split AC units in multiple rooms, and a sleek open kitchen with glass backsplash. The unit appears very baby-friendly with no visible sharp corners, smooth light-colored wood flooring, and a balcony with floor-to-ceiling sliding doors (would need to verify balcony railing height). Good natural light from large windows; the apartment looks newly renovated and in excellent condition."}
