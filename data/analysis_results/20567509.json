{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with brand-new furniture, stylish kitchen with built-in oven and induction cooktop, honeycomb tile backsplash, and a separate bedroom with new mattress still in plastic wrap. The space is very clean and well-designed with good natural light from large curtained windows. For baby safety, the coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but the kitchen island bar stools and the low coffee table could be concerns; being on 1F is convenient for stroller access but no bathroom photos were provided to assess slip risks."}
