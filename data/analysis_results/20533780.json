{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated furniture and fixtures from perhaps 10-15 years ago. The living room is spacious but cluttered with personal items. Windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, but the balcony area with plants and the exercise equipment could pose hazards for a crawling baby. Kitchen is functional but not renovated. Natural light appears adequate through the large windows."}
