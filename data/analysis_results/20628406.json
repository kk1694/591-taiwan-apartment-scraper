{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with high-end marble feature walls, recessed LED lighting, split AC, and polished marble-look tile floors throughout. The unit is very clean and modern but appears largely unfurnished; the smooth hard tile floors could be slippery for a crawling baby, and the sliding glass balcony doors on the 1F would need child-proofing. Being on the first floor eliminates stair/elevator concerns but may mean less natural light — the balcony area visible through the glass doors faces other buildings. Listed via Miller House agency; the description is essentially just an agent ad with no meaningful property details, which is a minor red flag for transparency."}
