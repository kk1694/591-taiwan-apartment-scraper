{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed lighting, sleek white tile floors, and contemporary built-in cabinetry. The space is clean and bright with an open floor plan. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp furniture corners (leather sofa, TV stand edges) would need attention; no visible balcony railings or stairs in these images. Natural light appears limited with only small high windows visible."}
