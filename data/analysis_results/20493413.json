{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District, near Minsheng/Dunbei area", "notes": "Clean, unfurnished apartment on 13F of a well-maintained high-rise building with an upscale marble lobby and elegant staircase. The unit has polished tile floors, recessed and ceiling lighting, wall-mounted AC units, and large windows with balcony railings providing good natural light and mountain views. For baby safety, the balcony railings appear to have adequate spacing but should be checked in person; the tile floors are very slippery when wet which is a concern for a crawling baby, and the unit is completely empty so would need furnishing. No major red flags — this is a quality building listed through a professional agent (有巢氏房屋)."}
