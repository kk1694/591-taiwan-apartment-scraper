{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "This listing appears to be a residential apartment at 25 ping (82.5 sqm) on the 11th floor of an 11-story building priced at NT$45,000/month. The description only contains a generic broker advertisement with no actual property details, making it impossible to assess condition, baby safety features, or modernity. Being on the top floor (11F/11F) may raise concerns about heat in summer and potential roof leaks; the unknown layout and lack of images make it difficult to evaluate natural light, balcony safety, or overall suitability for a family with a baby."}
