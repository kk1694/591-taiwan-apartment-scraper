{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious modern unfurnished apartment on the 14th floor with polished tile floors, modern kitchen cabinetry with built-in cooktop, split AC units, and stylish lighting fixtures. The balcony has ornamental metal railings with narrow spacing which is relatively baby-safe, though a toddler could still climb the decorative swirl pattern — a balcony lock or barrier is recommended. The unit is very clean with good natural light from multiple windows, and the large open layout is great for a family but will require significant furniture investment since it comes completely empty."}
