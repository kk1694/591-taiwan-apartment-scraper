{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei Arena (Songshan District)", "notes": "Clean, recently renovated apartment with modern fixtures including new kitchen cabinets, stainless steel refrigerator, wall-mounted AC, and flat-screen TV. Light wood laminate flooring is easy to clean. For baby safety: the windows have security bars which is good, but the small balcony area near the kitchen has metal railings that would need childproofing. Natural light appears limited due to small high windows and surrounded by other buildings. Overall very clean and well-maintained studio-style layout."}
