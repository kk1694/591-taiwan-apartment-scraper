{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei 101, Xinyi District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated furniture and fixtures from the 1990s-2000s era. The glass coffee table with sharp corners poses a baby safety concern. Limited natural light with small windows that have security bars. The unit appears clean but has that classic Taiwan older-building style with floral sofas and dark wood cabinets. Prime location with direct view of Taipei 101."}
