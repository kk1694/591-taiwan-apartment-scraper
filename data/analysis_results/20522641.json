{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale modern apartment in excellent condition with high-end finishes, recessed LED lighting, built-in cabinetry, and quality furniture throughout. The space appears very clean with smooth surfaces and rounded furniture corners that are relatively baby-safe, though the glass display cabinet and open shelving would need childproofing. Good natural light visible through zebra blinds in bedroom; at 6F/13F likely has elevator access in this quality building."}
