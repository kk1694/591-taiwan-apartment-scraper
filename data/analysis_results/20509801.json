{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with clean finishes, built-in storage, and contemporary kitchen with gas stove. The raised platform bed could be a minor tripping hazard for a crawling baby, and the decorative wooden slat divider has gaps that may need baby-proofing. Overall very clean with good natural light from multiple windows, glass shower enclosure in bathroom is reasonably baby-safe."}
