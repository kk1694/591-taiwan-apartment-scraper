{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with high-quality dark wood flooring, recessed ceiling lighting, built-in cabinetry, central air conditioning, and a digital door lock. Multiple rooms with good natural light and greenery views; the balcony has horizontal metal railings which could be a concern for a climbing toddler but appear adequately spaced. The unit is completely empty/unfurnished, so all furniture including kitchen and bathroom fixtures are not shown — buyers should verify. At 25 ping on 4F/5F, the lack of confirmed elevator could be inconvenient with a stroller and baby gear."}
