{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with fresh white walls, modern wood-grain laminate flooring, recessed LED lighting, and split-type AC units. Very clean and unfurnished condition. For baby safety: no visible sharp corners or hazardous features, but limited natural light from small windows facing what appears to be a light well or adjacent building. Being on 3F of a 4-story building with no elevator info suggests a walkup."}
