{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Large older-style apartment with terrazzo floors and dark wood vintage furniture throughout. The unit is spacious (53+ ping) and clean but dated — kitchen has older wooden cabinetry with a gas stove and basic range hood, and the living/dining areas feel empty and institutional. For baby safety, the hard terrazzo floors are a concern for falls, the balcony sliding doors in the living room need child locks, and the heavy wooden furniture has sharp corners that would need padding. Natural light appears limited based on the nighttime photos, though the kitchen has a skylight; the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag suggesting minimal landlord engagement."}
