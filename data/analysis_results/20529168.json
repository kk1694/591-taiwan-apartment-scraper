{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with updated fixtures including recessed lighting, split AC, and a well-equipped white kitchen with gas stove and range hood. The glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a baby safety concern, and the open floor plan would need baby gates. Good natural light from multiple windows; overall excellent condition and very spacious for a family."}
