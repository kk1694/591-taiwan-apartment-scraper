{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, beautifully renovated studio apartment with brand new fixtures, LG washer/dryer, induction cooktop, and stylish bathroom with glass-enclosed shower. The space is clean, bright with good natural light from large windows, and appears baby-friendly with rounded furniture edges and no visible balcony access. At 9 ping it's compact for a couple with a baby but the open layout maximizes usable space."}
