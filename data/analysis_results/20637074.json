{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with clean white walls, recessed lighting, and updated AC units. The living area is spacious with an open kitchen layout. For baby safety, the raised platform bed in the second room could be a concern as a crawling baby could fall off; the windows appear to have secure framing but would need child locks. Good natural light from large windows with nice city views."}
