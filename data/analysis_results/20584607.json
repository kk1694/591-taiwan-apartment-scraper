{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with open-concept living, kitchen island with bar seating, warm wood flooring, and recessed lighting throughout. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light and greenery views. For baby safety, the kitchen island corners and bar stools may need attention; the balcony appears accessible through sliding doors and would need childproofing. Overall very clean and well-maintained condition."}
