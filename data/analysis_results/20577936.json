{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious 3F/3F townhouse-style residence in Wenshan with traditional Taiwanese decor including heavy wood furniture, ornate chandelier, and recessed lighting. The interior is clean and well-maintained but dated in style. Major baby safety concerns include an internal staircase visible in the living room, steps at the exterior entrance area, and metal railings outside; the exterior patio area has uneven stone flooring and exposed pipes. The kitchen is functional with updated cabinetry. No elevator in this low-rise building, which combined with the 3rd floor walkup and stairs throughout makes it challenging for a couple with a baby."}
