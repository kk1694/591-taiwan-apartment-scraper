{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and high-end appliances including a large Panasonic refrigerator. Good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety: no visible balcony railings to worry about, rounded furniture edges on most pieces, but the glass-framed closets and small side tables with sharp corners would need childproofing. Very clean and well-maintained unit on the 5th floor of a 13-story building which almost certainly has an elevator."}
