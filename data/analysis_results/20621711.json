{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large spacious apartment with dated 90s-2000s decor featuring ornate crystal chandeliers, decorative ceiling dome, and vintage wallpaper. The unit is clean but shows an older aesthetic with marble-look tile floors and wood flooring in some rooms. For baby safety, the hard tile/wood floors and balcony access are concerns; the open layout is good but the decorative fireplace area has potential hazards. Natural light appears decent through the balcony doors but limited in interior rooms."}
