{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean white/grey finishes, recessed lighting, stylish light fixtures, and light wood-tone flooring throughout. The unit appears to be a 1-bedroom layout with a small living area, breakfast bar kitchen, and a separate bedroom with built-in wardrobe; the balcony houses the washing machine, gas water heater, and AC outdoor unit with glass railings. For a couple expecting a baby, the space is quite compact at 20.5 ping and the breakfast bar stools and glass balcony door could be safety concerns; the bedroom is small and unfurnished which could serve as a nursery, but overall the unit may feel tight for a growing family despite its excellent modern condition."}
