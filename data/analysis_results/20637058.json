{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean white/gray minimalist design, polished tile floors, built-in kitchen with modern appliances (fridge, microwave), wall-mounted TV, and ample storage cabinets. Floor on 10/15 strongly suggests elevator. Good natural light from large windows with floor-to-ceiling curtains. Baby safety: hard tile floors may need rugs, floor-to-ceiling windows should be checked for locks, sharp cabinet corners may need padding. Overall excellent condition with no visible red flags."}
