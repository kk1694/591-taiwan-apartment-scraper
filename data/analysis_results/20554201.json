{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment on the 14th floor with sleek minimalist design, recessed lighting, polished tile floors, split AC, and stylish wood-accent panels throughout. The unit is spacious (~46 ping), very clean, and appears brand new or recently renovated with a modern bathroom featuring a bathtub and grey stone-look tiles. For baby safety, the large windows have no visible balcony which is good, but the raised bed platform in the master bedroom has sharp edges that would need padding; the floors are hard tile throughout so area rugs would be advisable for a crawling baby. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly agency with Japanese/English services), which is a positive sign for a foreign couple, though this typically means higher agent fees."}
