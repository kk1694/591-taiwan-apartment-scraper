{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with fresh neutral decor, track lighting, updated furniture, and multiple bedrooms. Very clean condition with rounded furniture edges and no visible stairs, making it reasonably baby-safe. Natural light appears limited based on curtained windows; being on 2F of a 7-story building, elevator status is uncertain."}
