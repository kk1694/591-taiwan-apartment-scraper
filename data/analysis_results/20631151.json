{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, luxury-styled apartment with designer finishes including geometric accent walls, marble floors, and upscale furniture. The glass coffee table with metal edges and tufted leather bed frame have sharp corners that pose risks for a crawling baby. The bedroom has a balcony with floor-to-ceiling glass doors - railing visibility is limited but access would need childproofing. Good natural light through large windows, very clean condition."}
