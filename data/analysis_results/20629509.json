{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with clean finishes, recessed lighting, and quality flooring (tile and wood). The unit is spacious at 60 ping with large windows providing excellent natural light. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors that should be kept locked; the glass coffee table corners could be a concern but the overall open layout with minimal furniture presents few hazards."}
