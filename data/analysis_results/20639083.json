{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is clearly a ground-floor commercial/retail space, not a residential apartment. It features large street-facing glass storefront windows, a service counter with 'BROMPTON' branding (likely a former bicycle shop), decorative ceiling installations, built-in display shelving with LED backlighting, and a back storage/workshop room with industrial finishes. Completely unsuitable for a couple with a baby — no kitchen, no bathroom visible, no bedrooms, and the space is designed for retail use with hard concrete flooring and exposed track lighting throughout."}
