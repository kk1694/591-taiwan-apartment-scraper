{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious, modern unfurnished apartment on 1F of a 13-story building with clean polished tile floors, recessed lighting, central AC, and a well-fitted kitchen with glass partition doors. The unit is very clean and in excellent condition with no visible stairs, though being on 1F means natural light may be limited as windows appear to face a narrow alley or courtyard. For baby safety, the smooth hard tile floors could be slippery, and the open doorway to the exterior vestibule area with iron grille gates would need a baby gate; no dangerous balcony railings or sharp corners are visible."}
