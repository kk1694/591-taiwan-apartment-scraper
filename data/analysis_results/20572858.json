{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment in excellent condition with recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, modern kitchen with gas stove, and stylish bathrooms with glass shower enclosures and bidet toilet. The building has a confirmed elevator (visible in image 3 on floor 4). For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows lack visible child locks but do have sturdy frames; the polished tile floors could be slippery, and the glass shower doors in the bathroom would need childproofing. Good natural light from large windows; the unit appears very clean and move-in ready, though the listing description is minimal (agent promotion text only), which is a minor red flag — ask for full layout details."}
