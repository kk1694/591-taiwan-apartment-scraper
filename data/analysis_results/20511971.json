{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Older-style apartment (probably 15-20 years old) with dark wood flooring, dated furniture, and heavy curtains throughout. The unit has at least 2 bedrooms, a living room, a study, and 2 bathrooms — spacious at 33.6 ping with decent natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners, glass bathroom shelves are at reachable height, and the bathroom floors could be slippery; the smaller bathroom has exposed electrical cords near the toilet which is a concern. Overall clean but cluttered and worn — functional but not freshly renovated."}
