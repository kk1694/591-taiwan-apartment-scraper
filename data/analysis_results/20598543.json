{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Dunhua South Road / Renai Road area, Da'an District", "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment on 15F of a 21-story high-rise with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows and a balcony. The unit appears clean with polished tile floors, built-in AC, and modern glass partitions, though it is completely empty and would need furnishing. The balcony has wooden railings that appear relatively low and would need baby-proofing; the large sliding glass doors to the balcony are also a consideration for child safety. The tree-lined boulevard views suggest this is near Dunhua South Road or Renai Road, a premium Da'an location."}
