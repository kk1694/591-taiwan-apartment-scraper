{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older walk-up apartment on 3F of a 4-story building with a tasteful but dated renovation featuring exposed wooden ceiling beams, wood-tone flooring, and traditional Chinese-style furniture. The space is spacious at 33 ping with decent natural light from large sliding glass doors and windows overlooking greenery and a balcony. Baby safety concerns include the open balcony accessible via sliding doors with low railings, the raised kitchen bar counter area with a high stool, and the older-style bathroom with a slippery tile floor; the lack of elevator on the 3rd floor would also be inconvenient with a stroller."}
