{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including window AC units and traditional decor. The unit has good natural light from balconies with metal bar railings that appear safe for children. For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors and open balcony areas would need childproofing; walls show some signs of age with yellowing paint on ceilings. Spacious at 42 ping with multiple rooms including potential nursery space, but overall condition is fair with aging finishes."}
