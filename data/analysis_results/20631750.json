{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with mixed condition - has AC units and basic fixtures but shows wear on floor tiles and dated finishes. The raised tatami-style platform area has steps without railings which poses a fall hazard for crawling babies/toddlers. Limited natural light due to barred windows on ground floor, and the 1F location may have security and humidity concerns. Overall clean but needs baby-proofing for the step edges and large bookshelf."}
