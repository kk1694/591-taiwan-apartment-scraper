{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment listed through Elegant Realty (expat-friendly agency). Spacious living room with polished tile floors, leather sofa, large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light, modern AC units, and stylish accent walls. At least two bedrooms with wood flooring, built-in wardrobes, and desks; kitchen has Panasonic fridge and clean white countertops. Being on 12F/12F (top floor) of what appears to be a newer high-rise, it almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the living room has a large sliding glass door/balcony access that would need a gate or lock, and furniture corners (dining table, shelving) are relatively sharp but manageable with corner guards; no stairs visible. Overall excellent condition with no red flags — a strong option for a family with a baby."}
