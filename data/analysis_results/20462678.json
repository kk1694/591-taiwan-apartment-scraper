{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a clean but dated apartment with traditional Taiwanese wooden furniture from the early 2000s. The unit has two bedrooms with decent natural light, a spacious living-dining area, and tile floors throughout. For baby safety, note the glass coffee table with sharp corners and the raised platform in the bedroom which could be a tripping hazard; no balcony railings visible in these images but a small balcony appears present."}
