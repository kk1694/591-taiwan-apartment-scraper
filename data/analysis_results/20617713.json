{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Modern loft-style duplex with high ceilings, wood-tone flooring, contemporary kitchen island, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. Major baby safety concern: the unit has an internal staircase to a mezzanine/loft level with open edges and glass railings that would need childproofing, and the stairs lack gates. The apartment is clean and well-maintained with stylish fixtures, but the split-level design is not ideal for a crawling baby or toddler."}
