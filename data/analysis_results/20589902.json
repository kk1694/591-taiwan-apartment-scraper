{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean minimalist design, leather sofa, wall-mounted TV, and updated fixtures including split AC units. The living area has a balcony with floor-to-ceiling glass doors that may need baby-proofing; the coffee table has sharp metal corners that pose a hazard for toddlers. Good natural light from multiple windows, spacious layout suitable for a family, and the building being 18 floors strongly suggests elevator access."}
