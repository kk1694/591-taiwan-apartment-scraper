{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style duplex apartment in Da'an with clean tile floors, recessed lighting, AC units, and a well-equipped kitchenette with stainless steel appliances. Major baby safety concern: the unit has an internal staircase leading to a mezzanine/loft level with no visible safety gate, which poses a serious fall risk for a crawling baby or toddler. The bedrooms are compact but clean with natural light from windows; the living area has large sliding glass doors providing good light, though the balcony railing visibility is limited."}
