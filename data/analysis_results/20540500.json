{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nanjing East Road Section 2, near Songjiang-Nanjing MRT Station", "notes": "This is a modern high-rise apartment (16F/18F) in the 'New Tokyo Residence' building with full amenities including pool, gym, and social hall. The 1+1 bedroom layout with dual balconies and a large terrace provides good natural light but the terrace and balconies warrant careful baby-proofing checks for railing gaps and height. Simply furnished with appliances included; excellent MRT access (62-104m to Songjiang-Nanjing station on two lines) makes it very convenient for a growing family, though at 28 ping the space is modest for a couple with a baby."}
