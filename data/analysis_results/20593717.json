{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "The listing description only contains a generic promotional message for real estate agent packages (starting from NT$240 per listing), with no actual property details, photos, or description of the apartment itself. At 46 ping and NT$78,000/month in Songshan District on the 2nd floor of a 5-story building, this appears to be a reasonably sized apartment, but without images or a real description, it is impossible to assess modernity, baby safety features, or condition. The lack of substantive listing content is a red flag — this may be a placeholder or agent-generated listing rather than a genuine rental offering."}
