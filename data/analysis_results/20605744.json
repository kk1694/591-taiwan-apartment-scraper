{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou, near mountainside with green hillside views", "notes": "Spacious and clean apartment on 18th floor of a 21-story building with recessed LED lighting, split AC units, and polished tile floors. The living room is large with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows showing lush mountain greenery; stunning panoramic mountain and city views from the high floor confirm Beitou hillside location. For baby safety, the window in the living room has vertical railings which is good, but the hard tile floors throughout and wooden furniture with sharp corners (coffee table, bed frame) would need padding; no visible balcony access or dangerous stairs, and the high floor with elevator access is convenient for a stroller. The bedroom shown has only a single bed frame and limited furnishing, suggesting the unit may need additional furniture."}
