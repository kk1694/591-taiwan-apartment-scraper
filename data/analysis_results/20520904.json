{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-quality apartment in excellent condition with sleek LED ring lighting, polished tile floors, modern kitchen with LG fridge, gas stove, built-in oven, and glass backsplash. The living room has large floor-to-ceiling sliding doors to a balcony with proper metal railings; the balcony door should be baby-proofed once the child is mobile. All rooms are clean, bright, and flat-floored with no stairs, making it safe for a baby; the tile floors are slippery so rugs may be needed. At 10F in a 12-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator, which is great for stroller access."}
