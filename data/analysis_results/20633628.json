The kitchen features sleek red cabinetry with built-in appliances. Baby safety concerns include the balcony with decorative iron railings that may have gaps, and the glass coffee table with sharp edges. Good natural light from large windows and a spacious balcony area. Clean and well-maintained condition overall."}
