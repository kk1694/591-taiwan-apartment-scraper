Features two bedrooms, open kitchen with washing machine and microwave, flat-screen TV, and built-in wardrobes with glass display cabinets. For baby safety, the bedroom has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors to a small balcony with narrow railing gaps that would need childproofing; the tile and hardwood floors are smooth but hard. Good natural light from large windows in both bedrooms; overall very clean and well-maintained condition with no visible red flags."}
