{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment with high ceilings, marble accent walls, crystal chandeliers, and clean tile floors. The unit features an internal staircase to a mezzanine level which is a significant baby safety concern — stairs have no visible gate and the upper loft area has metal railings a toddler could reach through. The glass display shelves in the living area also pose a risk. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with security grilles. Overall well-maintained and clean, but the loft layout with open stairs makes it less ideal for a family with a baby without substantial childproofing."}
