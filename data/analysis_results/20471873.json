{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older-style Taiwan apartment with traditional wood-grain cabinetry, dated light fixtures, and cream-colored tile flooring. The unit is spacious and clean but unfurnished. Windows have metal security grilles which are good for safety; balcony access has sliding doors with low thresholds. For baby safety, the open floor plan has no visible stairs or sharp corners, but exposed electrical outlets near floor level would need covers."}
