{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious unfurnished apartment (78 ping) with dated but well-maintained finishes — ornate ceiling medallions, marble floors in living area, wood-look laminate in bedroom, and older window-unit ACs suggest 1990s-era construction. The kitchen has a full-size gas range/oven and dishwasher but older tile and cabinetry. For baby safety, the balcony visible in image 2 has traditional low balustrade railings that would need childproofing; the polished marble floors are very slippery and could be hazardous for a crawling/walking toddler. Good natural light from large windows and balcony sliding doors; the unit is clean and empty, but the dated style and high price (NT$80K) are notable."}
