{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/studio space rather than a residential apartment - features include an open floor plan with track lighting, concrete flooring in a basement-like area (image 5), and decorative wainscoting suggesting a photography studio or retail space. The space has good natural light from large windows but includes a dark basement-like lower level with no windows and exposed pipes, which is not suitable for family living. Not recommended for a couple with a baby due to potential stairs between levels and the commercial nature of the space."}
