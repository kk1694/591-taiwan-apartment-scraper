{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-appointed duplex-style loft apartment in excellent condition with high ceilings, modern LED recessed lighting, stone accent wall, leather sofa, full kitchen with gas stove, oven, and range hood, plus clean bathrooms with glass shower enclosures and modern toilets. Major baby safety concern: the internal staircase to the loft/mezzanine level has open-style railings that a toddler could slip through or climb, and the stairs themselves pose a fall hazard — a baby gate would be essential. The balcony has metal railings visible through floor-to-ceiling glass doors; natural light is decent from the 2F position. Being on 2F of a 27-floor building strongly suggests elevator access."}
