{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with recessed LED lighting, large flat-screen TV, and contemporary furniture. The space appears very clean with polished tile floors throughout. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the balcony visible through large windows would need childproofing. Natural light is good from the floor-to-ceiling windows. Being on floor 10/13 strongly suggests elevator access."}
