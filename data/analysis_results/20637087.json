{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Zhongshan District, number 13 visible on street sign", "notes": "This is NOT a residential apartment - it is a commercial storefront currently operating as a beauty/skincare salon called 'Luxe Young'. Images show a shop entrance with large glass windows, a reception area, treatment beds, and commercial fixtures. Completely unsuitable for residential living or raising a baby. The listing description is also just a generic 591 agent advertisement, not an actual property description. Major red flag: this appears to be a commercial space being listed, not a home."}
