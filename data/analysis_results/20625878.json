{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, clean white tile floors, and large sliding glass doors providing good natural light. The open floor plan and smooth floors are baby-friendly, though the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. Building appears to be a newer high-rise (5F/15F) which typically has elevators in Taiwan."}
