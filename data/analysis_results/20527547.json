{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, newly renovated studio-style apartment with industrial-chic exposed ceiling beams, light wood laminate flooring, and a loft/mezzanine sleeping area accessed by steep built-in stairs — a significant baby safety hazard requiring gates or barriers. The building appears upscale with a landscaped rooftop terrace; good natural light from large windows, well-equipped kitchen with washer, microwave, and induction cooktop. For a couple expecting a baby, the open loft structure with ladder-like stairs and elevated platforms is a major concern, and at 14 ping it may feel cramped once baby gear is added."}
