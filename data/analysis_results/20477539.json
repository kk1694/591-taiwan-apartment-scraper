{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District near Taipei 101", "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment in excellent condition with contemporary design, wood laminate floors, and upscale finishes including marble accents and recessed lighting. Good natural light from large windows with city/Taipei 101 views. The glass coffee table has sharp edges that would need baby-proofing, but overall the open layout and lack of stairs make it reasonably safe for a family with a baby."}
