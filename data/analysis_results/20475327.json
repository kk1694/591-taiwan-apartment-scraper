{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment with high-end finishes throughout — recessed LED ceiling lighting, sleek built-in cabinetry, modern blue-toned kitchen with stainless appliances, polished tile floors, and large black-framed windows providing abundant natural light and greenery views. The 50.71 ping size is very spacious for a family. For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery, windows appear to have no visible child locks, and the kitchen has sharp-cornered furniture; however, there are no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings. The 8-story building on the 4th floor very likely has an elevator, and the overall condition is move-in ready and extremely clean."}
