{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated furnishings, heavily cluttered with personal belongings and storage boxes throughout. The space is large but very messy, with worn leather sofas, old wooden furniture, and an outdated kitchen with tile backsplash. Windows have security grilles limiting natural light. For baby safety, the heavy clutter with boxes, sharp-cornered wooden furniture, and exposed shelving units are significant concerns; the low coffee table and scattered items on floors would need clearing. Ceiling shows some water staining which may indicate moisture issues. At 3F with no visible elevator in an older 7-floor building, carrying a stroller up stairs could be problematic."}
