{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern wooden flooring, built-in wardrobes with accent lighting, a large TV unit, AC, and a Maxirest branded mattress. The living area has decent natural light through large blinds-covered windows, and the space appears clean with a separate bedroom. For baby safety, the metal-framed dining chairs have sharp corners, and there appears to be a low balcony railing visible in image 5 that would need childproofing; the open TV cabinet shelves are also accessible to a crawling baby. At 20 ping in Da'an district on the 6th floor, it's a reasonable size for a small family but somewhat compact once baby gear is added."}
