{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, newly renovated apartment with modern finishes including white tile floors, modern kitchen with gas stove, Chimei fridge, microwave, and grey wood-tone cabinetry. The living area is minimally furnished with a leather sofa, small dining table, and appears to have multiple rooms including at least one bedroom visible through doorways. Being on 7F/21F strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the hard tile floors could be slippery and the glass interior partition window between rooms is a concern; no balcony is visible in the photos which is a plus. Natural light appears limited with small windows, but the space is very clean and move-in ready. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — verify actual layout and room count in person."}
