{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale modern apartment with elegant finishes including marble accent walls, crystal chandelier, and contemporary furnishings. The space is very clean with good natural light from windows. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors and sharp-edged glass coffee table may need attention, but overall no dangerous balcony railings or stairs visible. Being on 8F of a 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
