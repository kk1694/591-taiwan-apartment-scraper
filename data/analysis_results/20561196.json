{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with marble accent wall, recessed LED lighting, sleek white kitchen with gas stove and built-in microwave. On 19th floor of a 22-story building so elevator is certain. The bay window seating area has good natural light but could pose a climbing hazard for a toddler. Floors are polished tile which may be slippery; furniture has some sharp corners on the coffee table and TV unit that would need padding."}
