{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a well-maintained duplex apartment (spans 2 floors with internal staircase) with modern recessed lighting, clean white tile floors, and updated built-in storage. Baby safety concern: the internal staircase between floors is a significant hazard for crawling/walking children and would require gates. The apartment appears clean with good artificial lighting, though natural light appears limited based on the small windows visible in the second bedroom."}
