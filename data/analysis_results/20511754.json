{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including light wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, glass-backsplash kitchen with induction cooktop, and AC. Major baby safety concern: there is an open loft-style staircase with no railings and steep alternating-tread steps, which is very dangerous for crawling babies and toddlers. The apartment appears to be a loft/mezzanine type with the sleeping area likely upstairs; natural light comes from large windows in the living area but blinds are drawn in all photos, making it hard to assess true brightness."}
