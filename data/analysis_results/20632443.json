{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Dated 1990s-era apartment with ornate white molding, etched glass dividers, and old-fashioned furniture throughout; the space is spacious (~40 ping) with multiple bedrooms, a large round dining table, and a separate kitchen, but the decor and fixtures feel very outdated. Baby safety concerns include balcony sliding doors in at least two bedrooms with accessible railings, sharp-cornered marble side tables, and glass partition panels near the entryway. Natural light appears moderate from the balcony windows but the 3rd floor position in a 19-story building suggests possible obstruction from neighboring structures; the unit is clean but will likely feel musty and would benefit from significant modernization."}
