{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "The listing description is minimal and appears to be a promotional/advertisement template rather than a real property description. At 36.31 ping (119.8 sqm) for NT$65,000/month in Da'an District, the price seems reasonable for the size. Being on the 2nd floor of a 6-story building, it likely lacks an elevator (older Taipei buildings under 7 floors often do), which could be inconvenient with a stroller and baby. Without images or a detailed description, baby safety features (balcony railings, stairs, sharp corners) and overall condition cannot be assessed."}
