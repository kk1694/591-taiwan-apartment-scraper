{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Yanji Street, Songshan District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures and decor from the 1990s-2000s; the living room has decorative ceiling details and older-style AC units. One bedroom shows wall staining and wear. Balcony access via large sliding doors is a potential baby safety concern requiring gates. The glass coffee table with sharp edges is also a hazard. Good natural light from large windows, spacious layout, but overall condition is below average for the price."}
