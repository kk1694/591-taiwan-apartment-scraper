{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern, spacious unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, crystal chandelier, AC, modern kitchen with large refrigerator, and a clean bathroom with bathtub. The unit is on the 10th floor of a 13-story building (very likely has elevator), managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). For baby safety, the large open living space with hard tile floors would need area rugs; the balcony with sliding glass doors visible in images should be checked for railing height, and the bathtub will need supervision. Good natural light from large windows with curtains. No red flags — the unit appears brand new or recently renovated, very clean, and the 60-ping size provides ample space for a growing family."}
