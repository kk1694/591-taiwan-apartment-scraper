{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment in Da'an with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in dark wood cabinetry, and AC units. The living area is very large with clean, glossy surfaces. The flat tile floors throughout are baby-friendly being easy to clean, though the very slick polished surface could be slippery for a toddler; the living room has adequate natural light from large windows with curtains. At 2F in a 6-story building with no elevator confirmed, carrying a stroller up one flight of stairs may be manageable but worth confirming. The description is minimal (agent listing placeholder) which is a minor red flag - request more details on layout, kitchen, and bathroom before committing."}
