{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, recently renovated open-plan studio with industrial-chic exposed ceiling pipes, track lighting, wood-look laminate flooring, and minimalist Scandinavian-style furniture. The kitchen is compact with an induction cooktop, microwave, and small fridge. Being a studio layout with living/sleeping in one open space (no separate bedroom), it will feel cramped for a couple with a baby at ~20 ping. No visible balcony hazards, but the lack of separate rooms and limited storage are concerns; the exposed pipes along the ceiling are out of reach. The 19-floor building on floor 5 very likely has an elevator. Clean and well-maintained but overpriced for a studio in Datong district."}
