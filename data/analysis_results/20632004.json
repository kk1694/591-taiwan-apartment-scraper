{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained upscale apartment on 11F with modern dark wood flooring, recessed lighting, split AC units, and a fully equipped kitchen with granite countertops. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows in both the living room and master bedroom with city/mountain views. For baby safety, the living room has a large balcony with sliding glass doors that should be kept locked; the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding; the overall flat layout with no stairs is good. The apartment is clean and in good condition with built-in wardrobes and an en-suite bathroom, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag worth clarifying with the agent."}
