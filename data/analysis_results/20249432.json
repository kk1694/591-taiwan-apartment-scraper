{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with modern built-in cabinetry, polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and split AC units. At least two spacious bedrooms, a study/dining room with extensive storage, and a clean bathroom with glass-enclosed shower/tub. The slippery glossy tile floors and sharp bed frame corners are baby safety concerns; the balcony visible from the living room has sliding glass doors that should be checked for secure locks. No elevator info available for this 4F/6F older building, and the listing description is just a generic agent ad with no real property details, which is a minor red flag."}
