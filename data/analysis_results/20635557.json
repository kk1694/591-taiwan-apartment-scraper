{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with traditional carved wooden furniture, hardwood floors, and Japanese-style sliding partition doors. The unit is clean and well-maintained but dated, with an AC unit and balcony access providing natural light. For baby safety, the heavy wooden coffee table has sharp corners, the balcony sliding doors need child locks, and the glass-paneled partition could be a concern; the building is 18 floors so likely has an elevator, and at 18.9 ping it is a reasonable size for a small family."}
