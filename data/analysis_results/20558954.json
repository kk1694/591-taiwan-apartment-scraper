{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, recently renovated apartment in clean condition with recessed LED lighting, white tile floors, and updated kitchen with LG refrigerator and induction cooktop. The open-plan layout is spacious at ~85 sqm with a breakfast bar and living area; being on floor 3 of 15 strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp-cornered coffee table/bar stools would need attention, but the flat single-level layout with no visible stairs is a plus. Large curtained windows suggest decent natural light, and the overall condition appears move-in ready with no red flags."}
