{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious and well-maintained apartment with modern fixtures, crystal chandelier, recessed lighting, and high-quality built-in cabinetry. The unit features clean tile floors, spacious living and dining areas, and multiple bedrooms with good natural light. For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors and glass cabinets with decorative items at low height would need childproofing; no visible sharp corners on furniture but the polished tile floors could be slippery."}
