{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with high-quality finishes including light wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, leather sofa, marble-top dining table, open-plan kitchen with gas stove, range hood, and built-in cabinetry. The 52-ping space is spacious and well-maintained with a clean, minimalist design. For baby safety, the open kitchen layout means the gas stove area would need a gate/barrier; the coffee table has a sharp metal frame edge that could be a concern. Natural light appears moderate from the kitchen windows but limited in the living room area. At 9F/11F the building almost certainly has an elevator. No major red flags — this is a premium Da'an apartment at a price point reflecting its size and condition."}
