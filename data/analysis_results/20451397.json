{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment in excellent condition with contemporary furnishings, split AC units, and polished tile/wood floors. The balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors with metal railings visible - these appear safe but height should be verified for baby safety. Good natural light from large windows with mountain views; the open floor plan and smooth floors are baby-friendly though furniture corners may need padding."}
