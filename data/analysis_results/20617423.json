{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated wooden furniture, tatami room, and a bathroom showing visible grout staining and aging tiles — overall condition is fair but not modern. The balcony has metal railings that appear reasonably safe, but the bathtub and glass shelf in the bathroom pose baby safety concerns; the tatami room with sliding door to the balcony also needs childproofing. Natural light is decent from multiple windows and balcony access, and the 24-ping size is spacious, but the aged finishes and window-unit AC in one room suggest the unit has not been recently renovated."}
