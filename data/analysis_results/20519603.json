{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with stylish pendant lighting, two bedrooms (one master with ensuite, one smaller), a modern galley kitchen with gas stove, microwave, and fridge, and a clean bathroom with bathtub and glass shower partition. The 14-story building on 2F very likely has an elevator. For baby safety, the glass shower door and bathtub in the bathroom need attention, and the dining table has some sharp corners; however, the flat layout with no stairs is a plus. Natural light appears moderate from windows visible in the living room and bedrooms, and overall cleanliness is excellent."}
