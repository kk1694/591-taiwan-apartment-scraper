{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated parquet flooring, frosted windows, and old-style window AC units. The kitchen has aging cabinets and fixtures. At 5F/5F with no elevator information visible, climbing stairs with a baby could be challenging. Floors are relatively flat and rooms are spacious with no visible stairs inside, but the overall condition is dated and would need thorough cleaning and childproofing."}
