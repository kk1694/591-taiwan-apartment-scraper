{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment on 1F of a 4-story walkup building in Shilin. The living room is spacious at 43 ping with wooden-frame furniture, light-colored laminate flooring, and AC, but the kitchen is dated with olive-green cabinetry, cluttered counters, and a step stool posing a tripping hazard. The bedroom has decent natural light with barred windows and greenery outside. For a baby, concerns include the sharp-cornered coffee table in the living room, the low marble-top TV stand edges, and the generally cluttered dining area; the 1F location is convenient for stroller access but the overall condition is lived-in and would need a thorough cleaning."}
