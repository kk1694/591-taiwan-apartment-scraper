{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including clean tile floors, updated kitchen with appliances, and good natural light through large windows facing greenery. The open floor plan with spacious living and dining areas is baby-friendly with no visible stairs, though the glass coffee table and sharp furniture corners would need childproofing. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) without confirmed elevator access could be challenging with a baby and stroller."}
