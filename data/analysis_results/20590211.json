{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with high-quality polished tile floors, modern recessed LED lighting, and elegant chandeliers. The unit appears unfurnished with spacious rooms providing good natural light through large windows. Very baby-friendly with no visible balconies, low window sills, or sharp corners; the open floor plan and smooth surfaces are ideal for a crawling baby. At 3F of a 20-story building, an elevator is almost certain."}
