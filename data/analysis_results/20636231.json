{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with clean white tile floors, decorative wallpaper accent walls, built-in TV unit, split AC, and a compact open kitchen with full-size refrigerator. The unit is on 8F/8F (top floor) which is a concern as older buildings at this height may lack an elevator. Image 3 shows what appears to be an internal staircase visible behind the kitchen area, suggesting this may be a walk-up or a duplex unit — a significant baby safety concern with stairs. The floors are smooth tile with no visible sharp corners, and natural light appears moderate from the side windows; no balcony is visible, which is actually positive for baby safety."}
