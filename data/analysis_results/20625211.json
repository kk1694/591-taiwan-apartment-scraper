{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou, near a public park with pergola and green space", "notes": "Modern high-rise residential complex (14 floors) with clean tile floors, white walls, and dark trim baseboards. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at 35 ping with multiple rooms visible; polished tile flooring is slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby, and the exposed electrical panel near the entrance should be secured. Good natural light from windows, building has a well-maintained communal park/garden area with seating — nice for families. No visible balcony hazards from interior photos but the building exterior shows glass-railed balconies which would need child-proofing."}
