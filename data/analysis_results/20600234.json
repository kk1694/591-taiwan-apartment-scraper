{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained upscale apartment with modern fixtures including recessed lighting, split AC units, and quality hardwood floors. The spacious layout with open living/dining area and large floor-to-ceiling windows provides excellent natural light. For baby safety, the glass dining table has sharp corners, the balcony visible in image 1 has relatively wide railing gaps, and the mirrored wall panel could be a concern; the floor-to-ceiling windows have adequate railings but would need childproofing."}
