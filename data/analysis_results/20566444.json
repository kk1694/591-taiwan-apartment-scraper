{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated wood-grain vinyl flooring and traditional wooden doors, showing some wear. The living space is very spacious (35 ping) with adequate natural light from balcony windows. For baby safety: the balcony has floor-to-ceiling security grilles which is good, but the overall condition appears basic with some wall staining visible; no visible stairs but the 2nd floor location in a 4-story building may require stair climbing if no elevator."}
