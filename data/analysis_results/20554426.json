{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, newly renovated apartment with modern recessed lighting, polished tile flooring in living areas, and hardwood floors in bedrooms. The unit has good natural light through large sliding glass doors and windows. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors that appear secure; no visible stairs or sharp corners in the main living space. Being on the 12th floor of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
