{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu", "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern wood flooring, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing abundant natural light. The unit is on the 13th floor of a 15-story modern high-rise building, which certainly has an elevator. The space is very clean and open with no visible sharp corners or hazardous features; however, the large windows on a high floor are a baby safety concern and would need window locks or guards, and the unit is completely empty so all furniture and appliances would need to be purchased."}
