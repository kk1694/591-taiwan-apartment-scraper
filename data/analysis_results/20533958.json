{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Renovated older apartment with clean white floors and walls but dated wood-framed frosted glass partitions and an older-style intercom. The glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a baby safety concern, and the frosted glass doors/partitions could shatter if a toddler runs into them. The unit appears mostly unfurnished with a small balcony visible through sliding doors; natural light seems limited as photos were taken at night, and the kitchen/utility area visible through doorways looks cramped with exposed pipes and a wall-mounted water heater."}
