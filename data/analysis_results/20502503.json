{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Songshan Road, near Yongchun area, Xinyi District", "notes": "This is clearly a ground-floor commercial storefront, not a residential apartment. Image 1 shows a bare commercial space with concrete floors, drop ceiling with fluorescent lights, and a large Apple repair shop logo on the wall — it was previously used as a retail/repair shop. The remaining images show the surrounding street area with shops, a 7-Eleven, dental clinics, and busy commercial activity near Songshan Road and Yongchun. Completely unsuitable for a couple with a baby — this is a commercial space with no kitchen, bathroom, or residential facilities visible, and the 1F location on a busy commercial street would be noisy and not baby-safe."}
