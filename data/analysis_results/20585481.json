{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, renovated apartment with recessed lighting, AC, built-in white cabinetry, and light wood flooring in excellent clean condition. The space is completely empty/unfurnished with no visible balcony, stairs, or sharp corners - making it relatively safe for a baby with proper furniture setup. Large windows provide decent natural light, though images were taken at night; the 22-story building on floor 7 almost certainly has an elevator."}
