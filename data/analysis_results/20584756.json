{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, upscale apartment with modern finishes including crystal chandeliers, recessed lighting, sleek kitchen with built-in appliances, and polished tile floors throughout. The large living area and bedroom appear clean and well-maintained. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp furniture corners (coffee table, dining chairs) may need padding; the balcony visible through sliding doors should be checked for secure railings. Good natural light from large windows."}
