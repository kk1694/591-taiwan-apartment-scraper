{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Keelung River, Neihu", "notes": "Well-maintained, upscale apartment with hardwood floors, recessed lighting, modern bathroom with soaking tub, and excellent river views. The large floor-to-ceiling windows provide abundant natural light but the balcony access could be a concern for baby safety. Glass coffee table with sharp corners in living room would need childproofing. Overall very clean and spacious at 67 ping."}
