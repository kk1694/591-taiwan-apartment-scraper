{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern finishes including marble accent walls, light wood flooring, stylish sputnik chandeliers, recessed lighting, and a separated kitchen with glass doors. The spacious living and dining area is very clean and bright. There is a large enclosed balcony/sunroom with tile flooring and a hanging egg chair, which is a baby safety concern as a child could climb into it; the balcony sliding glass doors help mitigate access risk. Being on 5F/5F (top floor, no elevator info) means carrying a stroller up 5 flights could be a significant issue, and the top floor may have heat/leak concerns. Overall excellent condition and generous 47 ping size, but verify elevator access."}
