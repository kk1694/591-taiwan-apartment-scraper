{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District, with view of Taipei 101", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, modern LED light fixtures, split AC, and a sleek open kitchen with built-in appliances. The unit is on the 10th floor of a 15-story building (almost certainly has elevator), with a balcony that has metal railings — the balcony railing gaps could be a concern for a crawling baby and would need childproofing. The highly polished tile floors are slippery which is a fall risk for toddlers, but the open layout with no stairs and minimal sharp corners is otherwise baby-friendly. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors, and the unit appears very clean and move-in ready."}
