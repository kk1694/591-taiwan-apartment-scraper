{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated wooden fixtures and cabinetry throughout. The unit is spacious at 41.7 ping with multiple rooms including a living room, kitchen with glass dining table, master bedroom with hardwood floors, an empty room suitable as a nursery, and a second bedroom. The glass dining table has sharp corners that are a baby safety concern, and the kitchen has a glass-top table at child height; the master bedroom has hard wooden bed frame edges. Natural light appears decent from large windows with blinds, though photos were taken at night. The overall condition is clean but dated, with some wall discoloration visible — manageable for the price but not modern or recently renovated."}
