{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "This is a loft-style duplex apartment with exposed wooden beams, a large tree trunk decorative element, and an internal staircase leading to a mezzanine level. The wooden floors show visible wear and scratches, and the overall aesthetic is rustic rather than modern. Major baby safety concerns: the open staircase with no gate, the metal railing visible near the stairs, the glass coffee table, and the mezzanine/loft level with ornate but potentially climbable railings all pose significant fall hazards for a crawling baby or toddler. The living room has good natural light from large sliding glass doors with a balcony, but the bedrooms appear somewhat dark and compact."}
