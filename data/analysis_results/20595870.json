{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District, An Ho area", "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with premium finishes including marble dining table, recessed LED lighting, glossy tile floors, and a sleek white kitchen with black glass backsplash and gas stove. The open-plan layout with marble accents and designer pendant lights suggests a luxury renovation. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp marble counter/table edges are concerns; the blinds appear to have cords which should be secured. Natural light is limited in the photos shown (blinds closed), but windows are present. At 29 ping on 5F of a 12-story building, this is a spacious and well-maintained unit likely with elevator access. Listed by An Ho Real Estate (安禾房屋). The description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and number of rooms."}
