{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Da'an Forest Park", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with wood paneling, recessed lighting, and clean tile/wood flooring. Multiple bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and en-suite bathrooms. The glass coffee table with sharp corners and balcony sliding doors are potential baby safety concerns. Good natural light from large windows and balcony access. The nearby park shown in one image suggests a pleasant neighborhood environment."}
