{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment on the 12th floor with high-end finishes, elegant light wood flooring, stylish furniture, and good natural light from large windows with city views. The open-plan kitchen with bar-counter seating and glass partitions look upscale but the small decorative items on open shelves and the glass coffee table with thin metal base could be hazards for a crawling baby. Being on the top floor (12F/12F) of what appears to be a newer high-rise building, it very likely has an elevator; however, top-floor units may have heat or leak concerns."}
