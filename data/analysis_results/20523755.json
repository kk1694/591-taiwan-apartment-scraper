{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Older unfurnished apartment with dated yellow tile flooring throughout, old-style window AC units, and a basic but clean kitchen with gas stove and stainless steel countertop. The unit is spacious at 33 ping and appears freshly cleaned with white walls, but fixtures and finishes are clearly from an older era. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard and slippery, and exposed cables running along baseboards would need to be secured; on the positive side, the flat layout with no stairs is good, and the windows appear to have security grilles. Natural light seems limited with small windows and interior transom-style glass panels between rooms."}
