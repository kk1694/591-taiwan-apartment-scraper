{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious modern apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, black leather sectional sofa, and sleek built-in cabinetry. The unit features a spacious living room, master bedroom with ensuite bathroom, dedicated study/office space, and a modern kitchen with island bar. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners, and there is a balcony visible from the kitchen that would need childproofing. Excellent natural light from large windows with good cleanliness throughout."}
