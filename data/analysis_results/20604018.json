{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment from likely 1990s with dated fixtures - tile floors, older style windows, and a notably outdated kitchen with decorative tiles and arched doorway. The unit is clean and empty with decent natural light from bay windows. Windows have security bars which are good for safety but the hard tile floors and sharp-cornered built-in furniture would need attention for baby-proofing; the kitchen pass-through counter has sharp edges at toddler height."}
