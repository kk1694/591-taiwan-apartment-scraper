{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern, well-maintained apartment with good natural light. The living space features clean white walls, wooden flooring, and contemporary furniture including a comfortable sofa and dining area. For baby safety, the balcony area visible in the images has floor-to-ceiling windows which is positive, though the upper floor location (4F/4F) means no elevator access may be challenging with a stroller and infant. The kitchen appears compact but functional with modern appliances."}
