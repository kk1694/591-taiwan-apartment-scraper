{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or nearly new unfurnished apartment in excellent condition on the 14th floor of a 24-story building with modern finishes including polished tile floors, built-in kitchen cabinetry with built-in appliances, split AC units, and modern bathrooms. The balconies have decorative wrought-iron railings with wide gaps in the scrollwork pattern that pose a serious safety hazard for a baby or toddler — these would need childproofing mesh or plexiglass barriers. Abundant natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows; the unit is completely empty/unfurnished so you would need to furnish it entirely, but the spacious 4-bedroom layout with 3 bathrooms and 3 balconies is very family-friendly."}
