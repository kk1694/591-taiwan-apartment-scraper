{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District, near major intersection", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment in a new high-rise building (14 floors, clearly has elevator). Clean contemporary finishes with light wood flooring, recessed lighting, modern kitchen with glass backsplash, and stylish furnishings. The balcony has glass panel railings which are a baby safety concern as a toddler could potentially climb on the low wall section; the metal coffee table also has sharp corners. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling sliding doors. The unit appears well-maintained and move-in ready with appliances included, though at 21 ping it may feel compact for a growing family with separate living, dining, and bedroom areas."}
