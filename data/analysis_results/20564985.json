{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with bright white tiles, recessed lighting, and floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. The balcony has proper railings visible through the glass doors, and the open-plan living area has minimal sharp corners - glass coffee table edges would need baby-proofing. Kitchen is well-equipped with LG refrigerator, built-in oven/dishwasher, and modern cabinetry. Building appears to be a newer high-rise (5F/15F) which would have an elevator."}
