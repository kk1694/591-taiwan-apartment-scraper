{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-appointed apartment with high-end kitchen featuring a large LG side-by-side refrigerator, built-in oven, gas stovetop, and glossy cabinetry with central air conditioning throughout. The bedroom has a padded headboard wall, built-in TV mount, and dark wood finishes; the laundry area on the enclosed balcony includes a front-loading washer and gas water heater. For baby safety, the laundry balcony area looks narrow with exposed pipes and a water heater that should be kept inaccessible; the dark living room area has sharp-edged built-in cabinetry that may need corner guards. Natural light appears moderate from windows visible in the kitchen and bedroom, though curtains are drawn in some photos. At 34.4 ping and NT$70,000/month in Songshan on 6F/7F, this is a spacious, modern unit but the listing description is minimal (just an agent promotion), which is a minor red flag — request a full walkthrough."}
