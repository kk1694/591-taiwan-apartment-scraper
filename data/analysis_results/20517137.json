{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern unfurnished apartment with polished tile floors, wall-mounted AC units, and good natural light from multiple windows. The space appears safe for a baby with no visible stairs, balconies appear to have proper railings seen through windows, and rooms have rounded ceiling corners. The unit is spacious but completely empty so furniture will be needed."}
