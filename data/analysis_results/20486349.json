{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment (37.92 ping) in decent condition with tile floors in living/dining areas and wood floors in bedroom. Multiple rooms visible with dark wood doors, wall-mounted AC, and basic furnishings. The balcony has ornamental iron railings with wider gaps that could be a concern for a crawling baby; the bookshelf in the bedroom has open shelves and sharp corners that would need baby-proofing. Being on 4F/5F with no elevator visible, carrying a stroller up stairs daily would be a significant inconvenience. The listing description is essentially empty (just an ad for agent packages), which is a minor red flag suggesting limited landlord engagement."}
