{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including light wood flooring, recessed lighting, and a clean minimalist kitchen with gas stove. The unit is unfurnished with excellent natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the balcony has proper metal railings but will need childproofing; the space has no sharp corners and flat floors throughout. Being on the 7th floor of an 8-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator."}
