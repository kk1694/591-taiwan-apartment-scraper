{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with recently renovated flooring but dated fixtures - walls show wear, old-style AC units, and basic bathroom with bathtub visible. The unit is unfurnished with good space (38.9 ping) and appears to be undergoing cleaning/preparation. For baby safety: no visible stairs or dangerous balconies, but the wall-mounted shelves and exposed wiring near windows would need attention; some walls show damage/patches that could present concerns."}
