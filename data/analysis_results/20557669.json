{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, recently renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, track lighting, and light wood-tone flooring. The unit appears very clean with modern fixtures including AC and built-in storage. For baby safety, the space has no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access in the photos, but the bedroom shown has a single bed which may be too small for a couple. Natural light appears limited to one window in the living area. The small bedroom without windows could be a concern for baby room ventilation."}
