{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very stylish, high-end modern apartment with designer finishes including recessed LED lighting, built-in cabinetry, wall-mounted TV, glass-partitioned kitchen with bar counter, and quality appliances. The open-plan layout is clean and well-maintained, managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). For baby safety, the dark round coffee table has hard edges, the glass kitchen partition could be a concern, and the raised platform in the bedroom area near the doorway could be a tripping hazard; no balcony visible in these photos. The 14-floor building on floor 3 very likely has an elevator, and natural light appears limited based on the photos shown."}
