{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, newly renovated apartment in a high-rise (7F/21F) building with clean white tile floors, modern kitchen with Chimei fridge and gas stove, wall-mounted AC units in multiple rooms, and contemporary cabinetry. The apartment appears very clean but the bedrooms are quite small with only single beds, and natural light seems limited with small windows; the balcony was not shown so railing safety cannot be assessed. For a couple expecting a baby, the 3-bedroom layout offers enough space for a nursery, but the tile floors throughout could be slippery and the rooms feel compact."}
