{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a dated but functional apartment on the top floor (14F) of a high-rise in Zhongshan district, with dark wood flooring, older-style wooden furniture, a small kitchenette with gas stove, microwave, and mini fridge, and recessed lighting. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that pose a baby safety risk, and exposed cords/vacuum on the kitchen floor are hazards; the small fridge and compact kitchen suggest limited family cooking capacity. Good natural light from windows with city views, but the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — being on the top floor (14/14) may also mean potential roof leak or heat issues."}
