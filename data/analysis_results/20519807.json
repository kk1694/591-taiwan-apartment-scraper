{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be an office or commercial space rather than a residential apartment. The living room area has modern furniture with sofas and TV, but one room is clearly set up as an office with a conference/work desk, multiple office chairs, and a whiteboard — strongly suggesting this is being used as a business office. At floor 12/14 it likely has an elevator. The description is just a generic 591 agent ad with no real property details, which is a red flag. Not suitable for a family with a baby as this does not appear to be a genuine residential listing."}
