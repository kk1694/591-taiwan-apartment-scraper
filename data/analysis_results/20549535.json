{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Upscale, spacious apartment with luxurious European-style finishes including marble flooring, recessed ceiling AC, chandelier, and elegant crown molding. At least 3 bedrooms with the living/dining area being very large. The marble floors in common areas could be slippery for a crawling baby; the hard stone edges at floor borders are a minor concern. All bedrooms have wood flooring which is safer and warmer. Good natural light through windows in all bedrooms. The apartment appears very clean and well-maintained, listed through a Japanese real estate agency (Okumura). A 14-story building on the 5th floor almost certainly has an elevator. No visible balcony hazards in these photos, but the description is minimal (just an agent promotion) so kitchen/bathroom condition is unknown."}
