Located on 13F with good natural light and city views. The unit is unfurnished with exposed ceiling pipes typical of new Taiwan apartments. No visible balcony railings to worry about for baby safety, but the unit appears to be a single-level flat with no internal stairs. Very clean and move-in ready."}
