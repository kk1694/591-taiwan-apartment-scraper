{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with hardwood flooring, recessed lighting, AC units, built-in wardrobes, and stylish furnishings including Togo-style leather sofas and a Noguchi glass coffee table. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp edges is a concern and would need to be removed or padded; no balcony or stairs are visible which is positive. The apartment appears clean with decent natural light from large curtained windows, and at 18.54 ping with a separate bedroom it offers reasonable space for a small family, though the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only) which is a minor red flag."}
