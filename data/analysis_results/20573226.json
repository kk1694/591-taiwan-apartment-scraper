{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious high-floor penthouse (26F) with modern finishes, floor-to-ceiling windows, and excellent natural light with panoramic city views. Very spacious open-plan living with quality wood flooring and contemporary furniture. For baby safety: the large windows appear secure with proper framing, but the height (26th floor) means balcony/window locks should be verified; floor plan is flat and single-level with no stairs visible, which is ideal for a crawling baby."}
