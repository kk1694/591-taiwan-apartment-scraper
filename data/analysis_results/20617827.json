{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very clean, recently renovated apartment with polished white tile floors, recessed lighting, crown molding, wall-mounted AC units, and a modern security door. The 50 ping space is spacious with a large open living area and at least two rooms. The slippery glossy tile floors could be a concern for a crawling baby, and the black baseboard trim has sharp edges at corners; no balcony or staircase hazards are visible. Natural light comes through multiple windows but appears moderate due to nearby buildings. Being on 4F of a 7-floor older-style building, it likely has no elevator, which would be challenging with a stroller and baby."}
