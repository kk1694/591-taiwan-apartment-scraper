Good natural light from large windows in living room. For baby safety: tile floors are easy to clean but slippery; no visible balcony or stairs; furniture has some sharp corners on the wooden bed frame and TV cabinet that may need padding. The kitchen floor drain visible in image 5 should be covered."}
