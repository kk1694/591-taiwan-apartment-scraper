{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern light wood laminate flooring, track lighting, AC, and built-in cabinetry. The unit is unfurnished and very clean with large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light; the bedroom features a built-in window seat and shelving. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors with railings visible behind sheer curtains, and the window seat area in the bedroom should be monitored; overall the flat layout with no stairs and rounded/minimal corners is relatively baby-friendly. Being on 5F of a 9F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
