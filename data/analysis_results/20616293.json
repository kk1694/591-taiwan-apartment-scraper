{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious luxury-style apartment (84 ping) with polished marble floors, recessed lighting, and crown molding — well-maintained but dated decor from the 1990s-2000s era rather than truly modern. The unit is completely unfurnished with a separate kitchen visible through glass sliding doors. For baby safety, the hard marble floors are slippery and unforgiving for falls, and the raised platform/step between dining and living areas is a tripping hazard; large windows appear to have adequate railings but balcony details are unclear. Good natural light from multiple windows on the 5th floor of a 14-story building which almost certainly has an elevator."}
