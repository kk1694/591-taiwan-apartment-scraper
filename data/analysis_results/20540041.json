{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with contemporary finishes including track lighting, light wood-look flooring, and a fully equipped kitchen with gas stove and full-size refrigerator. Clean and spacious open layout with separate bedroom. For baby safety, the open-concept design has minimal sharp corners; however, the metal clothing rack in the bedroom could be a tipping hazard and the dining chairs have exposed legs that a crawling baby could bump. Natural light appears limited as curtains are drawn, but the space is bright with artificial lighting."}
