{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious unfurnished apartment (70 ping) with a mix of tiled living areas and wood-floored bedrooms. The living room has an older-style decorative ceiling medallion and Japanese-style sliding doors, suggesting a 1990s-2000s renovation rather than modern finishes. The bedrooms are clean with light wood flooring, AC units, and decent natural light from windows. For baby safety, the hard tile floors in the main living area and raised platform between rooms are concerns; no balcony railings or stairs are visible but the listing is completely empty so kitchen/bathroom condition is unknown. The description is essentially a placeholder ad with no real details, which is a red flag — verify actual unit condition and layout in person."}
