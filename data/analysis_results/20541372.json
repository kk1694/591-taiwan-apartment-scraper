{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with stylish fixtures including ring pendant lights, modern kitchen with appliances, and contemporary furniture. The unit appears to be a loft-style layout with a raised sleeping area accessed by what looks like stairs or steps, which could be a safety concern for a baby/toddler. Good natural light from large windows with zebra blinds. The hard tile floors throughout are easy to clean but slippery; the elevated bedroom area with no visible railings is a significant baby safety concern."}
