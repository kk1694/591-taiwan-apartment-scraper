{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, spacious apartment with modern white tile floors, split AC units, and video intercom system. The unit is on the 1st floor which is convenient but windows have security grilles limiting light; good for baby safety as no stairs visible and minimal sharp corners. The space is sparsely furnished with built-in storage cabinets, appearing well-maintained."}
