{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with high-end finishes including warm wood paneling, recessed LED lighting, large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors, and clean tile flooring. The unit is spacious at 45 ping with multiple rooms, a modern bathroom, and built-in storage. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings that appear adequately spaced but should be checked in person; the large glass sliding doors near the balcony could be a concern for a crawling toddler. Excellent natural light throughout from the full-height windows. No elevator information available — at 4F/6F in an older Zhongzheng district building, it likely lacks an elevator, which would be difficult with a stroller and baby."}
