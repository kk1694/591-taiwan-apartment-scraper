{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with sleek dark kitchen cabinetry, built-in appliances, and contemporary furnishings. The space is clean with good natural light from the balcony. For baby safety, the balcony has vertical metal railings that appear adequate, but the bar-height dining area with high stools could be a concern as the child grows; the open floor plan has minimal sharp corners which is positive."}
