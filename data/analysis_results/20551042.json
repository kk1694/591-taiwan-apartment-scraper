{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in near-new condition with high-end finishes throughout including built-in cabinetry, concealed ducted air conditioning, marble-look tile flooring, and a luxury bathroom with bathtub, glass shower partition, and electronic bidet toilet. The unit on 6F/16F strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the living room has a low marble coffee table with sharp corners that would need padding, and the bathroom glass partition and bathtub area would require supervision; windows appear to have secure black frames with no accessible balcony visible, which is positive. Very clean, spacious at 62 ping with good natural light from multiple windows, and the walk-in closet provides ample storage for a growing family."}
