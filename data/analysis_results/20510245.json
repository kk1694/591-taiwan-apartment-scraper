{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District, residential neighborhood", "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment (69.5 ping) in a European-style Taiwanese townhouse complex with ornate ceiling moldings, decorative iron front door, and older window-unit ACs. The unit is clean but dated with a somewhat baroque aesthetic. For baby safety, the balcony has brick and iron railings with gaps that could be concerning for a crawling toddler, and the large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors to the balcony would need child locks. The marble tile flooring in the living room is very hard and slippery which is a fall risk for a baby. Natural light is excellent with large windows in multiple rooms. Being on the 6th of 7 floors with no visible elevator, this could be a walk-up which would be very difficult with a stroller and baby."}
