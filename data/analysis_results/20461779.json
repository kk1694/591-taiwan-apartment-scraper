{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older-style unfurnished apartment with dated finishes including dark wood trim and traditional louvered doors. The unit is clean but appears to have limited natural light with small windows, and the empty rooms show some wear. For baby safety, the lack of visible balconies is positive, but the hard tile flooring throughout and multiple room doors would need childproofing."}
