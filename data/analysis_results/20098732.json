{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern studio apartment with updated fixtures including split AC, LG refrigerator, sleek white kitchen cabinets with glass backsplash, and modern bathroom with glass shower enclosure. The space appears clean but cluttered with moving items/plastic bags. For baby safety, the glass shower door and mirrored closet panels may need childproofing; no visible balcony railings or stairs but the floor-to-ceiling windows leading to what appears to be a small balcony would need attention. Natural light appears limited based on the nighttime photos."}
