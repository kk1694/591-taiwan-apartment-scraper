{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including LED cove lighting, designer ceiling details, light wood laminate flooring, TOTO bathroom fixtures, glass shower enclosure, and stacked LG washer/dryer. The space is very clean with a minimalist white aesthetic. For baby safety, the living area is spacious and open with no obvious stairs; the enclosed balcony/laundry area has windows with grilles which is positive. The glass shower door and some sharp furniture corners would need baby-proofing. Managed by UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a foreigner-friendly rental agency, which is a good sign for a foreign couple. The description is minimal (just a promotional placeholder), so layout details and number of bedrooms are unclear despite the generous 31 ping size."}
