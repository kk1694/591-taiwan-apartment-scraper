{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, recently renovated apartment with glossy white tile floors, modern LED ceiling lights, built-in TV cabinet with mirrored upper shelving, and a well-equipped L-shaped kitchen with large Sharp refrigerator, gas stove, and under-cabinet lighting. The polished tile floors are very slippery which is a baby safety concern; the bedroom has a window-unit AC and window with metal grille railings visible outside suggesting a lower floor. Overall very clean and bright with decent natural light, but the description is minimal (agent boilerplate only) which is a minor red flag — confirm layout details and whether there are stairs, as 38 ping at NT$85K in Shilin may indicate a townhouse/walkup with multiple levels."}
