{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated, empty unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed and track lighting, wood-look flooring, split AC units, smart digital door lock, and clean modern bathrooms with glass shower partitions. At 22F/24F the building almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the glass shower doors and open bathroom sliding door would need child-proofing, but there are no visible stairs, balconies, or sharp corners — the flat open layout is quite baby-friendly once furnished. Natural light appears limited to horizontal strip windows with roller blinds, which may feel somewhat dim during daytime."}
