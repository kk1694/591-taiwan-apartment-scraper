{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment with fresh white walls, modern LED ceiling lights, split AC units, light wood-tone flooring, modern dark-framed sliding balcony doors, and a new tiled bathroom still wrapped in protective plastic. The unit appears to be still under final fit-out with workers and construction debris visible. Being on the 5th/top floor with a balcony, the balcony railing height and type should be verified for baby safety; no elevator info is available but top-floor walkup with a stroller and baby would be a significant concern. The space is very generous at 31 ping with good natural light from the balcony and bedroom windows, and the clean modern finishes are a plus, though the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad) which is a minor red flag."}
