{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Modern, luxuriously decorated apartment with European-style crown molding, crystal chandelier, glossy white tile floors, and LED-lit mirror accents. The space appears to be a well-furnished studio/1-bedroom with a separate bedroom behind glass sliding doors, a kitchenette with microwave, range hood, and washing machine, plus a balcony visible in image 2. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has hard edges, the polished tile floors could be slippery, and the glass sliding doors between rooms would need child-proofing; the balcony railings appear adequate but should be verified in person. The apartment is very clean with decent natural light from the balcony side, though at 13 ping it may feel tight for a couple with a baby. On floor 7 of 14, the building almost certainly has an elevator. The listing description is minimal (just a promotional ad for the agent platform), which is a minor red flag — request full details directly from the agent."}
