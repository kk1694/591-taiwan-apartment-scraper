{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated studio apartment with stylish minimalist design, track lighting, wood-tone flooring, built-in kitchen with washer/dryer combo, microwave, and open metal shelving system. The space is compact at ~35 sqm as a single open-plan room with bed, small dining nook by the window, and kitchenette all in one area — quite tight for a couple with a baby. For baby safety, the metal open shelving unit with wire baskets could be a climbing/tipping hazard, and the bed frame without mattress shows slatted base that could trap small fingers; natural light is limited to one window but the unit appears very clean and well-maintained."}
