{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, fully renovated apartment with high-end finishes including marble accent walls, crystal chandelier, hardwood flooring, and a modern bathroom with Japanese-style toilet. Spacious open-plan living/dining area with excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows and a balcony. For baby safety, note the balcony access with sliding glass doors (will need child locks), and the round coffee tables with no sharp corners are a plus. Being on the top floor (7F/7F) is a concern if there is no elevator, and potential for roof leaks or heat issues. Listed through Dingli Rental Service agent."}
