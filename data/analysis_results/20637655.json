{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment in Xinyi with modern recessed lighting, wood-panel TV wall, leather sofa, and clean tile/wood flooring across a spacious living area and at least two bedrooms with en-suite bathroom and built-in wardrobes. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and the 2nd-floor walkup (no elevator evidence) are baby safety concerns; natural light appears limited as windows face neighboring buildings closely. Overall the unit is in very good condition but the minimal listing description (agent placeholder text only) is a minor red flag."}
