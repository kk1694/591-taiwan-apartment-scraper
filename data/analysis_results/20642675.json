{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "This space has an industrial/commercial feel with exposed ceiling pipes, track lighting, and concrete flooring at the entry — it may be a converted commercial or office space rather than a standard residential apartment. The kitchen is very minimal with just a small sink counter and no visible stove or proper cooking setup. For baby safety, the open layout with hard wood flooring is decent, but the lack of visible bedrooms in all 5 photos is a major red flag — the space appears to be a single large open room with only a small partitioned area. Natural light appears limited with few windows visible, and the overall feel is sparse and institutional despite being clean."}
