{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with recessed lighting, marble-pattern coffee table, large TV, and contemporary furniture. The bedroom appears to be a loft-style with low ceiling which could be awkward for adults. The apartment has clean tile and wood flooring, good for baby crawling. The coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding for baby safety, and the decorative iron candle holders in the dining area should be secured. No balcony visible in photos, reducing fall risk concerns."}
