{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated top-floor (7F/7F) apartment with clean white walls, marble-look flooring, modern bathroom with glass shower partition, and updated fixtures. The large rooftop balcony/terrace has glass and metal railings which are reasonably safe but the wide wooden deck area with planters and hoses could be a tripping/climbing hazard for a toddler; being the top floor with no confirmed elevator is a significant concern for carrying a baby and stroller. Good natural light through tall windows with double curtains, and the 38-ping size is spacious, but the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad) which is a minor red flag — verify amenities and lease terms directly."}
