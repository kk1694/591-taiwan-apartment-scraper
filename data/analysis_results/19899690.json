{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large apartment with dated interior featuring older-style lighting, furniture, and finishes from perhaps 10-15 years ago. The space appears clean with tile and wood flooring, multiple bedrooms with good storage including a walk-in closet. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, but windows appear to have standard curtains without visible balcony access in these images. Natural light seems limited based on small windows visible in bedroom photos."}
