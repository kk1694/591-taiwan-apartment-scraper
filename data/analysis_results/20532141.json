{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated dark wood furniture throughout, marble floors in living/dining areas, and laminate in bedrooms. The unit is clean and spacious at 34 ping with good natural light from large balcony windows, but the decor and fixtures (glass cabinets, ornate ceiling moldings, window-unit AC in dining area) are from the 1990s. For baby safety, the glass-top coffee table with sharp corners is a concern, the balcony has metal railings with wide gaps that would need childproofing, and the glass display cabinets could be hazardous; the marble floors are also slippery."}
