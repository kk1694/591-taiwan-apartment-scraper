{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with fresh white walls, modern recessed lighting, new wood-laminate flooring, updated doors, and a wall-mounted split AC unit. The space is very clean and spacious at 43 ping, with large windows providing good natural light and greenery views. For baby safety, the window railings appear adequate but the 5th floor walk-up (no elevator evidence) is a concern with a stroller; the sharp column corners in the living area should be padded, and the lack of visible window locks warrants checking."}
