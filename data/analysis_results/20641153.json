{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new, unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed lighting, ceiling-mounted AC, large floor-to-ceiling windows, and a clean open layout with tile flooring in living areas and wood-look laminate in bedrooms. The balcony has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors with what appears to be adequate railing height, and there are no visible sharp corners or stairs — relatively baby-safe once furnished. Good natural light from multiple large windows; the unit appears to be in a newer building (5F/15F strongly suggests elevator access), making it a solid option for a family, though the completely empty state means all furniture and appliances will need to be provided."}
