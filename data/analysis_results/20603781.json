{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious modern apartment on 11th floor with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. The space features contemporary finishes including recessed lighting, polished tile floors, and a sleek white kitchen with modern appliances. For baby safety, the balcony has glass railings that appear secure, but the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need protection; the overall open floor plan is spacious and mostly safe. Very clean condition with high-end fixtures throughout."}
