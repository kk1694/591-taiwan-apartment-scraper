{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment with upscale finishes including marble accents, crystal chandeliers, and mirrored ceilings. MAJOR BABY SAFETY CONCERN: The open floating staircase has no railings whatsoever and marble steps, posing extreme fall risk for a crawling/toddling child. The mezzanine level also has low glass railings. The space is clean and has high ceilings with good lighting, but the two-level design is highly unsuitable for families with young children."}
