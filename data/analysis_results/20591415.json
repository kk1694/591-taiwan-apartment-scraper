{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be an older standalone house or villa with a gated entrance, not a typical apartment. Images show exterior views including a carport with an older Mercedes, a rooftop terrace with washing machine and planters, and older-style windows surrounded by dense trees. No interior photos are provided making it impossible to assess living conditions. For a family with a baby, the rooftop terrace with low railings and multiple stairs to access different levels would be significant safety concerns. The property appears dated and may require maintenance."}
