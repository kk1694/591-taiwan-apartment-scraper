{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "This image shows a secondary bedroom (次臥2-1) with dated furnishings including an older-style wall-mounted AC unit, built-in wooden desk with corner shelving, and colorful drawer units. The room appears clean but not modern, with striped wallpaper and curtained window providing some natural light. For a couple expecting a baby, the open corner shelves with sharp edges and the small room size are concerns; the space would be tight for conversion to a nursery. The listing description is minimal (just an agent advertisement), which is a red flag — at 38 ping and NT$50,000/month in Songshan this could be reasonable, but more photos and details are needed to fully assess."}
