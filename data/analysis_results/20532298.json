{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu, near Audi Centre Taipei, with Taipei 101 view", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment in a quality residential complex with hardwood floors, built-in cabinetry, and a stylish living area with good natural light from large windows. The building features a landscaped courtyard garden and a gym with Chanson equipment, indicating a managed community with elevator access (6F/8F). For baby safety, the windows have iron security grilles which is positive, and the polished hardwood floors are smooth but may be slippery; the window sill area near the bay window seat should be monitored. The view includes Taipei 101, suggesting an open, unobstructed outlook — a very clean, move-in ready unit with no red flags."}
