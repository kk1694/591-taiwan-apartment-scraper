{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "This listing appears to be a residential apartment in Da'an District at 18 ping (59.4 sqm) on the top floor (12F/12F). The description only contains a generic promotional message for real estate agents rather than actual property details, making it impossible to assess condition, modernity, or baby safety features. Being on the top floor (12F/12F) may mean potential heat and leak issues; the lack of layout info and meaningful description is a red flag suggesting this may be a placeholder or agent-bait listing. The price of NT$55,000/month for 18 ping in Da'an is reasonable but should be verified with an actual viewing."}
