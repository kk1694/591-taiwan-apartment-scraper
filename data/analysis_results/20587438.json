{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be an old, run-down street-level townhouse being used partly as a garage/storage space, with scooters parked inside and miscellaneous junk scattered throughout. The floors are dirty and stained, walls show significant water damage and peeling paint, ceiling tiles are deteriorated, and the space lacks any proper residential furnishings or fixtures. Major red flags for a couple with a baby: exposed wiring, filthy floors, stairs between floors with no visible railings or gates, scooters stored indoors (fuel/fumes hazard), and the ground floor opens directly to the street with no secure barrier. This is essentially uninhabitable as a family residence in its current state and appears more like a semi-commercial or storage property."}
