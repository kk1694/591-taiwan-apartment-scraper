{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment in a newer building with white/light wood finishes, recessed lighting, split AC, sliding glass balcony doors, and built-in shoe cabinet at entry. The living room is compact but well-furnished with an L-shaped sofa, TV unit, and decorative brick accent wall. For baby safety, the balcony glass sliding doors should be kept locked, and the furniture corners appear relatively rounded; however, only the living room is shown — no bedroom, kitchen, or bathroom photos are provided, which is a red flag for a 22-ping unit at NT$40K in Wanhua. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), so details about layout, number of rooms, and amenities are unknown."}
