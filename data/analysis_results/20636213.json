{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with light wood flooring, contemporary fixtures, and stylish pendant lighting. The bathroom features a soaking tub with glass partition and modern vanity. For baby safety, the floor-to-ceiling windows with dark frames appear to have a narrow balcony/ledge area that would need childproofing; the glass coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but the open layout and low TV stand may need attention. Good natural light from large windows, very clean, and listed through a Japanese real estate agency (Okumura) suggesting a well-managed property likely in a newer building with elevator access on the 4th of 12 floors."}
