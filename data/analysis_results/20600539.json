{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious and modern unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in wooden cabinetry, split AC, and large sliding glass doors leading to a balcony. At 72 ping on the 10th floor of a 10-building, it is a top-floor unit in what appears to be a modern high-rise likely with elevator access. For baby safety, the smooth hard tile floors are slippery, the balcony glass doors would need child locks, and the built-in cabinet corners may need padding, but overall the open layout with no stairs is very baby-friendly."}
