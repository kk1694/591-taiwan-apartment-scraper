{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with sleek built-in kitchen featuring gas stove, oven, and microwave. Clean minimalist design with light wood flooring and contemporary cabinetry. For baby safety, the space is single-level with no stairs, but no windows or balconies are visible in photos which raises concerns about natural light and ventilation. The unit appears quite narrow/elongated in layout."}
