{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, dark wood-grain flooring, built-in cabinetry, and central air conditioning. The balcony has glass-and-metal railings which are reasonably safe but would need childproofing as a baby grows; the large bedroom windows sit low and should also be secured. Good natural light with greenery views, very clean and move-in ready; at 4F/5F with no elevator info, the walk-up could be challenging with a stroller and baby gear."}
