{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "萬翠城堡 (Wancui Castle), Wenshan District", "notes": "The listing shows only an exterior view of a large residential complex called 萬翠城堡 (Wancui Castle) in Wenshan District, built on a hillside. The building appears to be a mid-rise to high-rise complex (19 floors) with a gated entrance and underground parking. No interior photos are available, making it impossible to assess modern fixtures, baby safety concerns, or cleanliness. The description is just a generic agent advertisement with no useful property details, which is a red flag. At 57 ping for NT$40,000/month in Wenshan, the price seems reasonable but the lack of interior photos and proper description suggests caution."}
