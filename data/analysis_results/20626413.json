{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a ground-floor commercial/garage space in an old walkup building, not a residential apartment. The images show a roll-up metal shutter entrance, an open tiled garage-like area with corrugated roof, exposed wiring, and deteriorating walls. One room has cheap laminate flooring with Mario stickers and a window blocked by cardboard — very poor condition overall. Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby due to the non-residential nature, lack of proper fixtures, exposed wires, damp/dirty surfaces, and no natural light in the interior spaces."}
