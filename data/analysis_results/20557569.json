{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with clean wood-tone finishes, recessed lighting, and contemporary built-in cabinetry throughout. The living room is spacious with a leather sofa, the master bedroom has a stylish accent wall, and there is a second smaller room that could serve as a nursery. The open kitchen has modern white cabinetry and full appliances. For baby safety, the floors are smooth laminate with no visible stairs; corners on the TV console and coffee table are relatively sharp and would need padding. Listed via UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly rental agency) which is a plus. Natural light is decent with zebra blinds on windows. At 23.72 ping on the 5th floor of a 16-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator."}
