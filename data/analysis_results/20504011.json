{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) in Shilin. Spacious living room with stone accent wall, recessed lighting, and large tile flooring; two bedrooms with wood flooring and built-in wardrobes; bathroom features a smart toilet, bathtub, and glass-separated wet/dry zones. The living room has a glass coffee table with sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the bathroom bathtub area should be secured once the baby is mobile. At 52 ping on the 6th floor, the apartment is very clean and well-maintained with good natural light from large windows, making it an excellent choice for a family with a baby."}
