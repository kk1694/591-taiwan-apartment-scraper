{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment listed through UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly agency). The living room has a clean minimalist design with recessed lighting, glossy tile floors, a sofa, wall-mounted TV, and balcony access with floor-to-ceiling windows. There are at least two bedrooms (one master with double bed, one smaller room with a single bed/desk area), a dining area, and built-in shelving. For baby safety, the glossy tile floors could be slippery, the small balcony door needs a child lock, and the smaller bedroom has figurines on low surfaces within reach. Overall the unit is clean with good natural light from the large windows, and the 14-story building on the 4th floor almost certainly has an elevator."}
