{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, polished tile floors, contemporary furniture, and a spacious open-plan living/dining area. The unit is on the 10th floor of a 13-story building (almost certainly has an elevator), with multiple windows providing decent natural light though views face neighboring buildings closely. For baby safety, the tile floors are slippery, the glass-top desk and coffee table have sharp corners, and the open shelving units could be a climbing hazard; the balcony area visible in image 3 should be checked for railing gaps. The description is minimal (just a real estate agent ad), which is a minor red flag — at NT$96,000/month for Datong district this is on the high side, so verify the actual layout and number of bedrooms."}
