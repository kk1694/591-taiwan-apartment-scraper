{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-furnished apartment with high-quality finishes including built-in oven, induction cooktop, front-load washer, and large TV with soundbar. Living room has floor-to-ceiling windows with mountain views and light wood flooring. The balcony visible in image 1 has standard railings that would need baby-proofing; being on 5F/5F with no elevator indication is a concern for stroller access. Clean condition with good natural light."}
