{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with clean modern wood-grain flooring and freshly painted white walls. The space is quite large with good natural light from large windows with security grilles. For baby safety, the floors are smooth and flat with no stairs visible, though the metal shelving units have sharp corners that would need childproofing. The apartment appears clean but sparsely furnished; no bedroom furniture or beds are shown which is unusual."}
