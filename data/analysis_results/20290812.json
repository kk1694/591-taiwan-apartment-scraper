{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large apartment with European-style decor including ornate faux fireplace mantel, chandeliers, and floral wallpaper — dated rather than modern. Floors are polished tile, very clean, and the space is spacious at nearly 58 ping with good natural light from large balcony sliding doors. For baby safety, the balcony railings should be checked in person, and the glass-top coffee table with sharp edges is a concern; the hard tile floors would benefit from rugs or play mats. The listing description is minimal (just an ad for agent services), which is a red flag — no details on layout, rooms, or amenities despite the high NT$73,000 price."}
