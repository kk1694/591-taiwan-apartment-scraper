{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Brand new, completely unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern polished tile floors, wall-mounted AC units, dark-framed doors and windows, and clean white walls. The unit is on 7F of a 15F building which almost certainly has an elevator. Good natural light from large windows with city views. For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery and would need rugs/mats; the large windows appear to have secure railings, and no stairs are visible — single-level layout is baby-friendly. Red flag: the listing description is essentially empty (just a 591 ad template), and the unit is completely bare with no furniture, so expect significant move-in costs to furnish."}
