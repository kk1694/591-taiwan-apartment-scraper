{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern track lighting, new laminate flooring, updated kitchen with range hood, and clean bathroom with marble-style tiles. The space is unfurnished and very clean with good natural light from multiple windows. No visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings; the flat layout with no steps is baby-friendly, though exposed electrical outlets near floor level would need childproofing."}
