{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial or warehouse-style space, not a residential apartment. The images show large empty rooms with bare concrete/vinyl floors, exposed metal sheet roofing, track lighting, and a staircase structure under which there is sloped unusable space. One room has a corrugated metal ceiling typical of a tin-roofed structure or rooftop addition. There is no kitchen, bathroom, or residential furnishings visible. Major red flags for a family with a baby: the space lacks any residential character, has no visible bathroom or kitchen facilities, features steep stairs, and the description is just a generic agent promotion rather than actual listing details. This is likely a commercial/retail space being listed through a 591 house-sale package promotion and is not suitable for residential living."}
