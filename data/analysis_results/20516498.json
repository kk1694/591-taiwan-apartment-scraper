{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "The listing description is essentially empty, containing only a promotional message for the real estate agent platform rather than any actual property details. At 25.73 ping on the 10th floor of a 14-story building in Da'an District at NT$50,000/month, the price is reasonable for the area and size. Without images or a real description, it is impossible to assess modernity, baby safety features, natural light, or overall condition — an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
