{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment with clean tile floors and freshly painted walls, but older-style fixtures including window-unit AC, classic chandeliers, and an older metal front door. Being on the 1st floor is convenient for a family with a baby (no stair climbing), but ground-floor units in Taiwan can have humidity and pest concerns. The unit appears baby-safe with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings, though the completely empty space will need full furnishing; the tile floors are slippery which is a concern for a crawling toddler."}
