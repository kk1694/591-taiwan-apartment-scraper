{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "This listing appears to show multiple individual rooms within a shared apartment rather than a full 30-ping unit — each photo shows a different bedroom with its own bed, desk, and wardrobe but identical staging style, suggesting this is a partitioned suite (隔間套房) being rented as separate rooms. The rooms are clean and recently painted with tile flooring and AC units, but the building is older (crown molding, older-style windows with security grilles, wall-mounted split AC). For a couple expecting a baby, the major red flag is that this likely isn't a full apartment — at 42K/month for 30 ping on floor 4/5 of an older walk-up, it may be the entire floor subdivided into rentable rooms. Natural light appears limited with small windows behind security grilles. No kitchen, bathroom, or living area is shown, which is concerning."}
