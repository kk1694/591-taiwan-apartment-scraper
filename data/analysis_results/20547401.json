{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern and well-furnished apartment with stylish finishes, recessed lighting, built-in AC, sleek leather sofa, and contemporary bathroom with freestanding bathtub and washer/dryer. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), suggesting a building with elevator likely targeting foreign tenants. The coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, the hard tile floors in the living area are slippery, and the bathtub lacks a cover which is a drowning risk for a toddler. The bedroom is compact but functional; natural light appears moderate from what is visible through the dining area window. Overall clean and in excellent condition, though at 12 ping it may feel tight for a growing family with baby gear."}
