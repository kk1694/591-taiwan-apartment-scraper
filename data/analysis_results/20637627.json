{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with high ceilings, marble-look TV feature wall, modern light wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, and a stylish chandelier. The living room is clean and well-furnished with a sofa, TV console, and small dining area; kitchen visible in the back with fridge and washer. The glass transom above the wall suggests a possible loft/mezzanine level which could be a baby safety concern if there are stairs. The ornate iron front door has gaps that may need baby-proofing. Overall very clean and modern, but only the living area is shown — no bedroom or bathroom photos to assess full layout."}
