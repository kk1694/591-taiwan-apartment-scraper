{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious, modern apartment with clean white walls, wood flooring, and good natural light from large windows. The open layout with a kitchen island and living area appears well-maintained. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass railings which are secure, but the kitchen island corners and open staircase to a loft area would need childproofing; the loft railings appear adequately spaced but should be verified."}
