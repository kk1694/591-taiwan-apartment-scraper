{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Very modern and clean apartment with recessed LED lighting, light wood furniture, open-plan living area with kitchen bar stools, and large windows with good natural light. The 15-floor building on floor 3 almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the coffee table has some sharp corners that would need padding, and the bar stools near the kitchen could be a tipping hazard; the floor-to-ceiling window/balcony door should be checked for secure locking. Overall excellent condition, listed through Miller House agency, but the description is minimal (just a promotional placeholder) which is a minor red flag — verify details directly with the agent."}
