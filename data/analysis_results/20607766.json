{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a ground floor commercial or semi-commercial space rather than a residential apartment. The interior shows an empty unfurnished room with dated fixtures, dirty/stained flooring, and a commercial-style frosted glass door with heavy-duty locks. The outdoor area is an overgrown garden courtyard with narrow tiled pathways and many potted plants. Not suitable for a family with a baby - the space lacks residential amenities, appears neglected, and the uneven outdoor pathway with rocks and dense vegetation poses tripping hazards."}
