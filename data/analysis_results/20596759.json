{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and stylish apartment with high-end finishes including marble-look wall panels, recessed LED lighting, granite countertops, and contemporary furniture. The space appears clean and well-maintained. For baby safety, the sharp corners on the granite dining table/island could be a concern, and the small balcony visible in the bedroom has metal railings that would need baby-proofing. Being on the 15th/top floor with a balcony requires extra caution. Natural light appears adequate from the bedroom window."}
