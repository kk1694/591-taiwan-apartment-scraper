{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/office space rather than a residential apartment. The space is completely empty and unfurnished with exposed concrete ceilings, industrial track lighting, visible conduit pipes, an emergency exit sign, and a very large open-plan layout more typical of an office. The exposed brick areas and raw concrete ceiling suggest an incomplete or industrial renovation. Not suitable for a family with a baby — there is no kitchen, no bathroom visible, no residential fixtures, and the description mentions a real estate sales package (售屋套餐), suggesting this is a commercial listing by an agent."}
