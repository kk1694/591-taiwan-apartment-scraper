{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with wood-tone flooring, recessed lighting, sleek white kitchen with island/bar counter, and stylish wood panel dividers. The space is very clean, well-maintained, and nicely furnished with a contemporary aesthetic. At 26 ping on the 6th floor of a 14-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is a plus; corners on the dining table and low side tables may need padding, and the raised platform area in the bedroom could be a minor trip hazard. Natural light appears moderate from the windows visible in several photos, and the overall condition is excellent with no red flags."}
