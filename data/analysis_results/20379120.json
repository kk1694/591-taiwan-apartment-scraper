{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). The unit features high-end finishes with light wood flooring, recessed lighting, modern kitchen with built-in appliances, glass-enclosed bathroom, and stylish furnishings. For baby safety, the large windows have low window seats that would need childproofing, and the glass coffee table has sharp corners worth noting; however, the flat layout with no stairs is a plus. Good natural light from multiple large windows on a high floor (11F), and the overall condition is very clean and move-in ready."}
