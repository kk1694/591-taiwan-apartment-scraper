{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with designer finishes including marble walls, luxury freestanding bathtub, modern kitchen with integrated appliances, and stylish lighting. For baby safety, the open bathroom concept with direct bedroom access and glass partitions could be hazardous for a crawling baby, and the freestanding tub requires supervision. The dark color scheme limits natural light perception, though the space appears clean and well-maintained. The 11-story building at floor 5 likely has an elevator."}
