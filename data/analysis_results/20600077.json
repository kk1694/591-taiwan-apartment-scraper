{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Brand new or newly renovated apartment on 14th floor of a 24-story building with modern fixtures, polished tile floors, new kitchen with gas stove, range hood, built-in oven, and glass backsplash. Very spacious open-plan layout (~80 ping) with multiple split AC units, modern light fixtures, and large sliding glass doors to balconies. Baby safety concerns: balcony railings appear to be ornamental iron with wider gaps that a toddler could potentially reach through—verify spacing; the open balcony access via floor-to-ceiling sliding doors will need child locks. Excellent natural light from multiple balcony-facing windows. The unit is unfurnished and in pristine, move-in ready condition with no visible red flags. Note: the listing description is just a generic agent ad with no useful property details."}
