{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new luxury high-rise apartment on 25th floor with pristine condition - doors still have protective plastic wrapping. Modern finishes include recessed lighting, split AC units, high-quality tile flooring, and a stylish bathroom with glass shower enclosure. Good natural light from large windows with city views. For baby safety: no visible balconies in photos (good), but slippery polished tile floors and the high floor would require secure window locks. Unit is unfurnished/empty shell requiring full furnishing."}
