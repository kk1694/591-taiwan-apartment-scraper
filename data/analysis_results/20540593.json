{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near Taipei 101", "notes": "Upscale modern apartment in a high-rise with marble accent walls, recessed lighting, wood laminate flooring, and a well-equipped open kitchen. The view from the 12th floor directly faces Taipei 101, confirming a prime Xinyi location. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp edges that would need corner guards, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows appear to lack child safety locks; no visible balcony reduces fall risk. The apartment is clean with good natural light, though the bedroom is compact with an en-suite bathroom — overall a quality unit but the 83K price and limited bedroom space may be tight for a growing family."}
