{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, minimalist studio-style apartment with high-end finishes, recessed LED lighting, sleek built-in kitchen, and large sliding closet partition. The open-plan layout on the 13th floor of a 15-story building (almost certainly has elevator) offers good natural light through large windows with city views. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp metal legs, the open kitchen is not gated, and the glass/mesh room divider partition could be a concern; no balcony is visible which is actually a plus for child safety. Listed through UR HOUSE (foreign-friendly rental agency), which is a good sign for expat tenants."}
