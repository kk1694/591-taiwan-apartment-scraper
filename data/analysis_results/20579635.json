{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Well-furnished apartment with modern interior design featuring wood-look flooring, stylish lighting, and a fully equipped open kitchen with dining area. At least 3 rooms visible including a master bedroom with mountain views and a green children's room with wall stickers suggesting previous family occupancy. The enclosed rear balcony has a washing machine and gas water heater with exposed piping. For baby safety, the coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but windows appear low in some rooms and would need child locks; the metal wire shelf in the green room has sharp corners. Overall clean and move-in ready, with decent natural light from multiple windows."}
