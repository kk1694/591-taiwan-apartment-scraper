{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Excellent modern renovation with high-end built-in cabinetry, recessed LED lighting with cove accents, large Panasonic refrigerator, and sleek kitchen with marble-look countertops. The apartment is very clean with smooth tile floors throughout; the living room has large windows with good natural light and a city/greenery view from the 5th floor. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard (consider rugs), small coffee tables have sharp edges, and the glass-panel kitchen partition and glass display cabinets may need child-proofing; no dangerous balcony access is visible. At 44 ping this is a spacious, move-in ready unit in great condition with no red flags, though the description is minimal (agent listing placeholder) so layout details and lease terms should be confirmed directly."}
