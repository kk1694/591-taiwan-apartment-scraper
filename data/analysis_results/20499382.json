{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Upscale, well-renovated apartment with polished marble floors, recessed LED ceiling lighting, elegant wallpaper, and a formal dining room with chandelier. The unit is unfurnished in the living area (empty) but includes a large dining set; the highly polished marble floors could be very slippery for a crawling baby and would need rugs. At 53.8 ping on the 5th floor of a 14-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator; natural light appears moderate from the visible windows, and the overall condition is very clean and move-in ready, though the listing description is minimal (just a generic agent promo) which is a minor red flag."}
