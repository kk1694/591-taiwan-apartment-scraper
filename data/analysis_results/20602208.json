{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu", "notes": "High-end modern apartment with luxurious finishes including herringbone dark wood flooring, designer room divider with embedded TV, recessed lighting, and built-in appliances. The open-plan layout appears to be a large studio/1-bedroom with living and sleeping areas separated by a decorative partition; the glass coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need baby-proofing and the hard dark floors may need rugs for a crawling baby. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with curtains, very clean and well-maintained condition; listed through Miller House agency suggesting it targets expat/foreign tenants, and the 11-floor building on 3F almost certainly has an elevator."}
