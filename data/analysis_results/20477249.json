{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with premium built-in cabinetry, recessed LED cove lighting, polished stone floors, and a sleek U-shaped kitchen with glass backsplash and gas cooktop. The bathroom features a modern electronic bidet toilet and contemporary vanity. For baby safety, the polished tile floors in the living area are very slippery and the window sill area has decorative objects that could be pulled down; the bedroom has a raised platform/window seat with a small step edge. At 40 ping in Da'an on the 6th floor of a 16-story building, this is a spacious and well-maintained luxury unit, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — verify actual terms directly."}
