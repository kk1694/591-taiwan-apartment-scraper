{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very spacious unfurnished apartment (84 ping) in excellent condition with polished marble tile floors, recessed lighting, AC units, and a separate enclosed kitchen with modern green cabinetry and granite countertops. The large open living/dining area has abundant natural light from multiple large windows; the highly polished tile floors could be slippery for a crawling baby and the marble round dining table has hard edges that would need corner guards. Building is on 5F/14F suggesting elevator access; the listing appears to be a broker ad with minimal description, so bedrooms and bathrooms are not shown — further inquiry recommended."}
