{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with high-end modern finishes including designer wooden ceiling, sleek kitchen with breakfast bar, and quality flooring. Good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: the balcony visible in image 4 has floor-to-ceiling glass which could be a concern; the open layout with elevated bedroom platform may need baby gates. Overall excellent condition, very clean and stylish."}
