{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment with double-height ceilings, stylish fixtures, crystal chandelier, and clean white/wood finishes. The unit has a mezzanine loft level with low railings that pose a serious baby safety hazard — the open loft edge and low horizontal railing bars could allow a child to fall or climb through. The loft sleeping areas have very low ceilings making them impractical for adults. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows, fully furnished with AC, wardrobe, and sofa. Listed via agent (Going Global/天下亨通)."}
