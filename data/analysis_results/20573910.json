{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with modern recessed lighting, wood-panel accent walls, built-in wardrobes, and clean tile/wood flooring. The living room is spacious with leather sofas and a glass coffee table—the glass table with sharp corners is a baby safety concern. The bedroom has an en-suite bathroom with dark tile finishes. At 2F with only 7 floors and no visible elevator in photos, it may be a walk-up building which could be challenging with a stroller. Natural light appears moderate—bedroom windows face a light well between buildings. Overall clean and move-in ready condition."}
