{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white finishes, recessed lighting, and quality fixtures including split AC units in both living and bedroom areas. The bathroom features a glass-enclosed bathtub and modern fittings. For baby safety, the glass coffee table in the living room has sharp edges and the balcony has metal railings that would need supervision; the low platform bed is safer than elevated frames. Good natural light through large windows, very clean condition overall."}
