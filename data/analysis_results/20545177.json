{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern studio apartment with loft bed accessed via storage cube stairs - a significant baby safety concern as there are no gates and the loft railing has wide gaps. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony. Clean and well-maintained with light wood floors and contemporary furnishings, but the compact 10-ping size with loft design is not ideal for a family with a baby."}
