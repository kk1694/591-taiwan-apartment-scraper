{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Older-style apartment with classical white cabinetry and decorative ceiling panels, recently cleaned but not modernized. The unit has at least 3 rooms with good built-in storage, window-unit and split AC, and decent natural light through barred windows. For baby safety, the windows all have security grilles which is good, but the 5th floor without a confirmed elevator would be very inconvenient with a stroller; the living area has some half-height partition walls and exposed corners on built-in furniture that would need child-proofing."}
