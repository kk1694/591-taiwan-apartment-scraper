{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with new tile flooring, modern kitchen cabinetry, split AC units in multiple rooms, and fresh white paint throughout. The unit is very clean and in excellent condition. Being on the top floor (3F/3F) of a low-rise walkup building with no elevator is a significant concern for a pregnant woman and later carrying a baby up stairs; the exterior view shows a typical older Beitou residential neighborhood. The open layout and lack of furniture mean no immediate sharp-corner hazards for a baby, but the frosted glass sliding doors to the balcony area should be checked for secure locking."}
