{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District, near mountains", "notes": "Brand new or nearly new modern apartment in a high-end 12-story building with upscale lobby, concierge desk, and marble-clad elevator hall. The unit is unfurnished with pristine polished tile floors, recessed lighting, AC, and built-in shelving. Windows have proper safety railings which is good for baby safety, and there are no visible stairs or sharp corners. The 9th floor unit has mountain views and good natural light. Red flag: the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), so the actual layout and number of rooms is unclear despite the generous 29 ping size — request more details before committing."}
