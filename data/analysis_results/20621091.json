{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu", "notes": "Very modern, luxurious studio/1-bedroom in a high-end community with pool, landscaped gardens, and resort-style amenities. The interior features sleek minimalist design with light wood flooring, recessed ceiling AC, LED accent lighting, built-in wardrobes, wall-mounted TV, and a small kitchenette. The space is open-plan with a glass partition separating the sleeping area. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors with horizontal louver railings that appear secure; the flat layout with no stairs is good, but the glass partition edges and low TV console corners could need padding. Natural light comes through large windows/balcony doors, and the unit is very clean and well-maintained. Being on 13F of a 15F building in a modern complex, it certainly has an elevator. The pool area would need supervision with a baby/toddler."}
