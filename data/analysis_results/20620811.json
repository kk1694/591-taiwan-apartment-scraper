{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Renovated apartment with a distinctive teal/green color scheme, laminate flooring in living area, tile in bedrooms, modern bathroom with bathtub, rain shower, and smart toilet. The unit has at least 2 bedrooms (one smaller, possibly suitable as a nursery with built-in wardrobe), good natural light from windows, and AC units. Being on 5F/5F (top floor) with no elevator info is a concern for carrying a baby and stroller. The second bedroom is quite small and tight. The living area has an open kitchen visible in the back. Glass partitions and sharp-edged furniture in the living room could be baby hazards; the bathroom glass partition near the tub also needs child-proofing."}
