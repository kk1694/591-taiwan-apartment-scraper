{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Older apartment with hardwood floors, dated wooden cabinetry, and an aging bathroom with bathtub and some mold/grime along tile edges. The unit is spacious at 45 ping with multiple rooms including a smaller room with built-in shelving suitable as a nursery; however, the window-mounted AC units and older-style window grilles suggest the building is from the 1980s-90s. Baby safety concerns include the open bathtub without separation, glass-front cabinets at low height, and the overall dated condition of the bathroom; natural light is moderate with windows in bedrooms but the living area relies partly on track lighting."}
