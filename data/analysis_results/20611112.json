{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment on the top floor (11F/11F) in Da'an district with clean white walls, wood-look laminate flooring, crystal chandelier, leather sofa, built-in kitchen, AC units, and a mezzanine bedroom with low ceiling, wardrobe storage, and desk area. Major baby safety concern: the internal staircase has only a thin metal railing with glass panels and wide open gaps — this is a serious fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler and would require a sturdy baby gate at both top and bottom. The low mezzanine ceiling and top-floor position are also worth noting. The apartment is clean and in good condition with decent natural light from side windows, but the loft layout is not ideal for a family with an infant."}
