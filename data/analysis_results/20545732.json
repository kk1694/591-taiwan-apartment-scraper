{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), featuring recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, a sleek open kitchen with island bar, modern appliances, and clean minimalist furnishings. The balcony has glass sliding doors providing good natural light but the railing height should be verified for baby safety; the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. At 36.67 ping on the 4th floor of an 11-story building (likely with elevator), this is a spacious, clean, move-in ready unit well-suited for a family, though the description is minimal (just a boilerplate agent ad) so details on lease terms and included utilities should be confirmed."}
