{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a property under renovation or possibly a commercial/office space with individual locker-style cabinets featuring locks, which is unusual for residential use. Exposed wiring visible in ceilings, unfinished light fixtures, and floor drains suggest incomplete work or non-residential purpose. The narrow corridor layout and locker cabinets raise concerns about suitability for a family with baby. At 2F/2F with no elevator evidence, stair access would be required."}
