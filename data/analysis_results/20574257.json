{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern, well-designed loft-style apartment with stylish fixtures including designer pendant lights, wood-paneled ceilings, and quality finishes. Major baby safety concern: the internal open staircase leading to the loft level has no railings or gates, posing a significant fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler. The space is clean with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows, but the multi-level design makes it challenging for child safety."}
