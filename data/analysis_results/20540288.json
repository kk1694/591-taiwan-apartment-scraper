{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment with dated wood paneling and parquet floors in a traditional Taiwanese style from the 1990s-2000s. The unit has good natural light from large windows in multiple rooms and a balcony with metal security grilles, which is positive for baby safety. The balcony sliding doors and low built-in cabinets in the living room could pose concerns for a crawling baby, but the flat layout with no visible stairs is a plus. The apartment appears clean but empty and would need significant furnishing; the listing through UR House (a foreigner-friendly agency) is a good sign, though the description is essentially just an ad placeholder with no real details about the property."}
