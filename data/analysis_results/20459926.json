{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin, near what appears to be a department store or commercial building (possibly Shin Kong Mitsukoshi or similar)", "notes": "Spacious older apartment (36.5 ping) on 8F/14F with dated fixtures including old-style AC units, aging light fixtures, and worn wooden flooring. The living room is large with black leather sofas and track lighting, and both bedrooms are generously sized with en-suite bathrooms and good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the wooden floors are a plus but the glass-paneled sliding doors, sharp-cornered coffee tables, and low wall shelving would need childproofing; windows appear to have security grilles which is reassuring. Overall clean but clearly from the 1990s era with no recent renovation, and the description is a generic agent placeholder with no real listing details, which is a minor red flag."}
