{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated unfurnished apartment with pristine white walls, polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and wall-mounted AC units in multiple rooms. The 12th floor location with balconies visible outside windows suggests potential baby safety concerns that would require secure railings. Unit is extremely clean but completely empty with no kitchen/bathroom shown; the hard tile floors and sharp wall corners would need childproofing."}
