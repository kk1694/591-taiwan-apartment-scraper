{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including glossy tile floors, recessed lighting, glass-enclosed shower, and a bidet toilet. The unit is fully furnished with solid wood furniture, includes a washing machine, refrigerator, AC, and a small kitchen area. For baby safety, the living room has a balcony with sliding glass doors that should be kept locked, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the bathroom glass shower door needs a child lock; overall the flat layout with no stairs is good for a crawling baby. Good natural light from large windows on the 10th floor with city views, and the building likely has an elevator given the 15-story height."}
