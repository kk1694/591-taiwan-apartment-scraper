{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern studio/1-bedroom in Da'an with recessed lighting, concealed AC, light wood-look flooring, stylish accent wall, and a well-equipped kitchen with built-in cabinetry. The open-plan layout is spacious and clean with no visible stairs; however, the glass coffee table has sharp edges that would need baby-proofing, and the bathroom appears to open directly into the bedroom area without a full partition. Natural light comes through large curtained windows on multiple sides. At 23.77 ping this is a generous size for a couple with a baby, though the open layout means limited separation between living and sleeping areas."}
