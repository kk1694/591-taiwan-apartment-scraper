{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and clean unfurnished apartment in Da'an with polished tile floors in the living area and dark hardwood floors in the bedrooms. The unit appears well-maintained with recessed lighting, split AC units in each room, and built-in cabinetry; at 2F/4F in a low-rise building it likely has no elevator, which is manageable but a consideration with a stroller. Baby safety looks reasonable with no visible open balconies or dangerous railings, though the glass-fronted display cabinet in one bedroom has sharp edges worth noting; windows have security grilles and blinds providing decent natural light."}
