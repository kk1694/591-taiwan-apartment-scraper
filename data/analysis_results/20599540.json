{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained older-style apartment with polished hardwood floors and traditional fixtures. The spacious layout offers good natural light through sliding glass doors to the balcony, which has floor-to-ceiling windows but the railing height should be verified for baby safety. Very clean condition with built-in storage, though the style is dated (90s-2000s era) rather than modern."}
