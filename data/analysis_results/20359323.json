{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This is a heavily industrial/loft-style space with exposed concrete ceilings, steel beams, track lighting, metal mesh partitions, and glass room dividers — it feels more like a trendy office or studio than a family home. There is no visible kitchen, bedroom furniture, or bathroom, and the space appears largely unfurnished with minimal residential amenities. Major baby safety concerns include hard tile and concrete surfaces throughout, sharp metal edges on industrial fixtures and mesh panels, glass partition walls, and being on the top floor (5F/5F) of a likely walk-up building with no elevator — very impractical with a stroller and newborn."}
