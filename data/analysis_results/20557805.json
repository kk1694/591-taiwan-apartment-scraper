{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang, with Taipei 101 visible from window", "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern light wood flooring, sleek white kitchen with Bosch built-in oven/microwave, induction cooktop, and quality stainless steel sink. The unit is unfurnished and very clean with recessed and track lighting. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). Being on 7F of a 26F building confirms elevator access. For baby safety: the flat layout with no stairs is good, windows have security louver grilles which help prevent falls, and no sharp corners are visible; however the unit appears to have limited natural light from the interior photos. The view photo shows Taipei 101 in the distance confirming the Nangang location. Red flag: the listing description is very minimal (just an ad for agent services) with no actual property details provided."}
