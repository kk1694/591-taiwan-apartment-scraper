{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Older-style top-floor (7F/7F) apartment with dated decor including faux-brick wall cladding, ornate wooden staircase leading to a rooftop addition, and heavy wooden cabinets. The interior staircase is a significant baby safety concern as it has wide-spaced balusters and no gate; the decorative partition with cutout patterns also poses a hazard. Good natural light through large windows and spacious tiled living area, but the dated fixtures, top-floor heat exposure, and rooftop-addition character suggest this may be an illegally added structure (頂加), which is a red flag."}
