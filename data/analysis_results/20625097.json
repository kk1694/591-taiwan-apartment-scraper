{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with clean finishes, wood flooring, AC, and contemporary fixtures. The building has an elevator visible on 4F with good common area maintenance. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners and the balcony has floor-to-ceiling windows which should be secure, but the enclosed balcony space is narrow. Good natural light from large windows. Spacious bedroom with two beds and central AC."}
