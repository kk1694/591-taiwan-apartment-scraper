{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older-style Taiwanese apartment (likely 1980s-90s) with dated but clean interiors. The living areas have tile flooring and classic white built-in cabinets with glass fronts; one room has hardwood floors with basic furnishings. The enclosed balcony has metal railing bars and sealed windows which is good for baby safety, but the bathroom has a slippery tile floor with no separation between wet/dry areas and exposed glass shelves at low heights that could be hazardous. Natural light is decent from the balcony side but limited elsewhere. The listing description is minimal (just a promotional ad), which is a red flag — at 33 ping for NT$48k in Shilin this is spacious but the aged condition and lack of detail suggest it may need negotiation or further inspection."}
