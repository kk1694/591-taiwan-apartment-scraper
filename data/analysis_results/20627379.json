{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Renovated unit with modern light wood flooring and white brick walls, but has concerning open stairwell/railing visible which is a significant baby safety hazard. Kitchen area has an unfinished raw wall that looks deteriorated. The space appears to be a duplex or multi-level unit within an older walkup building. Good natural light through large windows, but the open stairway railing gaps would require baby-proofing."}
