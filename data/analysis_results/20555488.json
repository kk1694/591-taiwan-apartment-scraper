{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Old building with exposed raw concrete ceilings showing significant wear and water staining throughout the main living areas. The space is very large and open-plan but has an industrial/unfinished feel with mismatched old furniture, mattresses on the floor, and a separate tiled room with dated fixtures. Being on 4F/4F of a walkup with no elevator is a major concern for a couple expecting a baby, and the exposed concrete ceiling condition suggests possible moisture issues. Limited natural light from small windows, and the rough unfinished surfaces are not baby-friendly."}
