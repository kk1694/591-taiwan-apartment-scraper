{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated interior with new wood-look flooring, fresh white paint, updated kitchen tiles and gas stove, and a clean new bathroom, but the building exterior is an aged 4-story walk-up with visible weathering and no elevator—stairs at the entrance are a concern with a stroller. The 1F unit is spacious at 39 ping with decent natural light from the front window, though the long narrow rear corridor/balcony area shows some ceiling moisture stains; the wet bathroom floor (no shower partition) could be slippery and would need baby-proofing."}
