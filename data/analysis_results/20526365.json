{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, recently renovated unfurnished apartment with clean white built-in cabinetry, recessed LED lighting with cove ceiling details, light wood laminate flooring, and wall-mounted AC. The unit is on floor 7 of a 22-story building, strongly suggesting an elevator. The space is completely empty and very clean, with large windows providing good natural light potential. For baby safety, the flat open layout with no visible stairs is a positive; however, exposed electrical cables and low power outlets on the walls would need to be child-proofed. No kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom photos are shown, which is a notable gap — only the main living area is visible across all five images."}
