{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, spacious unfurnished apartment with polished tile floors, multiple AC units, and good natural light from large windows. The unit appears well-maintained with a modern front door intercom system and decent kitchen. For baby safety, the open floor plan is good but the small balcony area near the kitchen would need childproofing; no visible stairs or major hazards."}
