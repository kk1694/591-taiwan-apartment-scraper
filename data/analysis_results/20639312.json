{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Very modern, stylishly renovated apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency with Japanese services). The unit features sleek built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, a well-furnished living room with sofa and TV, a clean kitchen area, and a nicely appointed bedroom with open wardrobe shelving and sliding glass doors. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp edges that would need corner guards, and the sliding glass doors between rooms could be a pinch hazard; no balcony is visible in the photos. Being on 4F of a 15F building strongly suggests elevator access, and the overall condition is excellent and very clean."}
