{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxury modern apartment with high-end finishes, designer furniture, marble accents, and LED accent lighting throughout. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety: glass coffee table corners may need padding, no visible balcony railings to assess, but overall very clean with minimal sharp edges. Being on 9F/9F of a modern high-rise building strongly suggests elevator access."}
