Clean condition with multiple rooms including bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and a visible kitchen. Being on the 5th floor of a 5-story building with no elevator evidence could be challenging for parents with a baby and stroller. The balcony has security grilles which is good for baby safety, and the open floor plan has minimal sharp corners."}
