{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Very spacious and modern apartment (62.7 ping) with recessed LED ceiling lighting, light wood flooring, and quality wooden furniture including a projector screen for home theater. The kitchen is narrow but well-equipped with modern built-in appliances and ample cabinetry. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light with mountain/hillside views, though the balcony railings visible in photos appear to have wide gaps that would need baby-proofing; the open floor plan is great for a family but the balcony access doors should be secured once a baby becomes mobile. Listed via An-Ho Real Estate agent; being on 5F/6F with no elevator info is a concern for carrying a stroller and baby gear."}
