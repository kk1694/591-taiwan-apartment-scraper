{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment with high-end finishes, built-in storage, full kitchen with microwave and oven, and excellent natural light from large windows. The unit appears very clean with rounded/minimal furniture edges and no visible balcony, which is good for baby safety. The open floor plan and glass partitions create a spacious feel, though the studio layout may feel cramped once baby items are added."}
