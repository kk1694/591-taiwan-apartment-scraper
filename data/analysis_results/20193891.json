{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a multi-room apartment with basic, dated furnishings. The rooms show different flooring (tile and hardwood) and older window AC units alongside split AC. Natural light appears limited with small windows and blinds. For baby safety, the tile floors are slippery and furniture has some sharp corners; no visible balcony hazards but rooms appear cramped for a growing family."}
