{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed lighting, large TV, leather sofa, and clean white tile flooring. The open floor plan with smooth surfaces and no visible stairs is good for baby safety, though the glass partition near the living room may need childproofing. Natural light appears limited with small high windows, but artificial lighting is good. Very clean condition overall."}
