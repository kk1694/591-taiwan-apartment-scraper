{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean and modern apartment with updated fixtures, split AC, large flat-screen TV, modern kitchen with stainless steel refrigerator and washing machine. The open floor plan and raised platform bedroom area with tatami-style table has no visible stairs but the elevated platform could be a minor concern for a crawling baby. Good recessed lighting throughout, intercom system present indicating a managed building. Being on 6F of an 11F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
