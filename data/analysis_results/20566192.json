{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with brand-new modern finishes including marble-look TV feature wall with LED accent lighting, light wood-grain flooring, recessed lighting, and sleek black-framed windows. The space is very clean, spacious, and unfurnished with multiple bedrooms. For baby safety, the balcony has railings visible through sliding glass doors that should be checked in person; being on the top floor (4F/4F) with no elevator is a significant drawback for carrying a stroller and baby up stairs daily. Good natural light from large windows on multiple sides."}
