{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with recessed lighting, central AC, marble-look tile floors, and designer built-in cabinetry. The bathroom features quality fixtures and stone finishes. For baby safety, the balcony has glass railings visible through the sliding doors which would need childproofing; the open floor plan with minimal sharp corners is generally safe but the low TV console edges and open shelving may need padding. Good natural light from balcony doors, excellent cleanliness, and move-in ready condition."}
