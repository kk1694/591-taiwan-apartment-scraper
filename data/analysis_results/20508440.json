{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, unfurnished apartment in a 17-floor building with tile floors, AC units in rooms, and built-in closet. The unit appears to be in fair condition with somewhat dated fixtures (ornate ceiling light, patterned wallpaper accent wall) but freshly cleaned. The living room has a balcony with sliding glass doors providing decent natural light, though bedroom windows appear to use frosted/obscured glass suggesting limited views. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard and slippery, and the balcony access would need childproofing; no stairs visible which is good. The listing description is minimal (just an agent promo), which is a minor red flag — confirm layout details and actual room count in person."}
