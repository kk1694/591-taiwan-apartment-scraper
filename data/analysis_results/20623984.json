{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-designed apartment with contemporary furniture, designer lighting, wall-mounted AC, and wood panel TV wall. The hallway image shows a high-end building with elevator access and modern finishes. The space appears clean with minimal baby hazards visible, though the balcony with railings would need childproofing; good natural light through large windows with sheer curtains."}
