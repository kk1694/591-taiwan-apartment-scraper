{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern 1F unit in a newer 6-story building with clean finishes, large floor-to-ceiling windows, and polished tile floors. Floor plan shows 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, separate kitchen, dining area, 2 living rooms, plus front and back courtyards - excellent for a family. Being on 1F with private courtyard access is ideal for baby safety (no stairs/balcony fall risk), though the courtyards would need childproofing; abundant natural light from large windows."}
