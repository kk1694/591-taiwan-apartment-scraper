{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including recessed ceiling lighting, wood-look flooring, and split AC units. Very clean and well-maintained with minimalist decor. The apartment has at least two bedrooms. For baby safety, the window sills are wide and could be concerning as a child grows; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings. Good natural light from large windows with security grilles. Being on 4F/4F with no elevator visible in images may be challenging with a stroller and baby."}
