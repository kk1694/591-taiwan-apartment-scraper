{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern and clean apartment with stylish interior design featuring recessed lighting, decorative chandelier, accent wall, and polished tile flooring. The open-plan living/dining/kitchen area is spacious at ~95 sqm. The smooth tile floors and low coffee table with sharp corners are minor baby safety concerns; no stairs or dangerous balcony railings visible. Being on the 8th floor of an 18-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Good natural light and overall excellent condition, though only one image is available so bedrooms and bathroom condition are unknown."}
