{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial or office space rather than a residential apartment. The large open rooms have fluorescent grid ceiling lights, parquet wood flooring, and no kitchen or living amenities — it looks like a vacated office. The bathroom is dated with old tile and basic fixtures. Walls show water staining and discoloration. Not suitable for a family with a baby — it would require significant renovation to convert to residential use, there are no windows visible for natural light, and the commercial-style layout lacks the rooms and facilities needed for family living."}
