The open-plan living/dining area is very spacious at 55.9 ping with floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light and city views. For baby safety, the balcony has glass railings which should be checked for height adequacy, the polished tile floors are very slippery and would need rugs/mats, and the marble coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. Listed through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency, a firm specializing in foreign tenants, which is a positive sign for an expat couple."}
