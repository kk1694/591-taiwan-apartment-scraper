{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with sleek minimalist design featuring recessed LED lighting, open-plan kitchen with island bar, concrete accent walls, and quality wood-look flooring throughout. The space is spacious at 37 ping with large floor-to-ceiling windows surrounded by lush greenery, though the 2nd floor position and dense vegetation outside may limit direct sunlight. For baby safety, the glass display shelving and sharp-cornered kitchen island with bar stools are concerns, but the open layout and smooth flooring are positives; no dangerous stairs or balcony railings visible."}
