{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "大直青境 (Dazhi Qingjing), Zhongshan District", "notes": "Large 40-ping unfurnished apartment in a well-maintained high-rise complex with landscaped courtyard. The unit is clean but dated with older-style tile floors, wood parquet bedrooms, and recessed ceiling details typical of 1990s-2000s Taiwanese construction. The balcony has tiled half-walls with sliding glass doors which provide reasonable baby safety, though the balcony railing height should be verified in person. Natural light is decent through large windows and balcony doors. Being on the 1st floor is convenient for a family with a stroller but may mean less light and more noise/humidity. No furniture or appliances visible — you would need to furnish entirely."}
