{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, floor-to-ceiling windows, and central air conditioning. The unit is unfurnished and very spacious with abundant natural light. Baby safety concerns include accessible balconies with glass sliding doors that should be secured, but the balcony railings appear solid. Clean, well-maintained building in a tree-lined area near what appears to be Daan Forest Park."}
