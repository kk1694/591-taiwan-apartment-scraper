{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with stylish finishes including wood-look flooring, modern LED pendant lights, wall-mounted AC, marble-look dining table, and designer furniture. The spacious living and dining area is open-plan and very clean. Baby safety concerns include an accessible balcony with sliding glass doors and metal railings visible from image 1, plus the low coffee table with metal edges; the balcony would need childproofing. Natural light appears decent from the balcony windows, though photos are mostly taken at night. At 50 ping and 5F with no elevator info, carrying a stroller up 5 flights could be a significant issue — confirm elevator availability. The listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag for transparency."}
