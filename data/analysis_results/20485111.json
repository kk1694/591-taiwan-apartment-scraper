The living room is spacious with large windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the glass panels/partitions and open balcony area with horizontal bar railings may need childproofing; furniture has rounded edges which is positive. The kitchen is fully equipped with gas stove and modern appliances. Overall excellent condition and very clean."}
