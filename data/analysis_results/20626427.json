{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment with modern recessed lighting, polished tile floors, and elegant crown molding throughout. The spacious living room and two visible bedrooms have large windows providing good natural light with mountain/city views. For baby safety, note the glass coffee table with sharp corners in the living room, the balcony access from the master bedroom with sliding doors that should be secured, and the hard tile flooring throughout which may need area rugs for a crawling baby. The unit is very clean and appears to be in a higher-end residential building on the 6th of 10 floors, almost certainly with elevator access."}
