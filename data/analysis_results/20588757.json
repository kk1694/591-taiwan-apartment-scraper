{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment (37 ping) in clean condition with a mix of tile and hardwood flooring, decorative wooden beam ceilings, built-in white shelving, and window-unit AC. The unit is on 2F of a 7-story walkup with no elevator visible, which is a concern for carrying a stroller and baby. For baby safety, the tile floors are slippery, the balcony areas have metal security grilles (good for safety), and the raised floor transitions between rooms could be a tripping hazard; the open layout and lattice room dividers have sharp corners to watch for."}
