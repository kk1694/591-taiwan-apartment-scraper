{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment in a well-maintained 12-story building with clean finishes, tile flooring, AC units, and a full kitchen with gas stove and fridge. Major baby safety concern: the open-riser floating staircase leading to the mezzanine/loft level has no risers and only a thin glass/metal railing, posing a serious fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler. The loft sleeping area has very low ceilings and open edges. The balcony area visible from the kitchen also needs childproofing. Good natural light from multiple windows on 9F, and the building exterior looks modern and well-kept."}
