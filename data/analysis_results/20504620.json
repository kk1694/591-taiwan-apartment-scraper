{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern duplex-style apartment with high ceilings, recessed lighting, stone accent wall, and high-gloss white tile floors. The interior staircase with open railings is a significant baby safety concern — the gaps between balusters and the open design would require baby gates at top and bottom. The space is bright, clean, and well-furnished with a large L-shaped sofa, dining table, and built-in kitchen cabinetry. Listed via UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly agency); the 27-floor building on 2F almost certainly has an elevator."}
