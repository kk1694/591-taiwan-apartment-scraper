{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious 3-bedroom apartment with mixed condition - some rooms have modern LED lighting and decent flooring, but the living room looks dated with older fixtures and clutter. The walls show wear marks and peeling in some areas. For baby safety, the glass coffee table poses a concern, and the metal bed frames have hard edges. Natural light appears limited with small windows, and windows have security bars which could be a positive safety feature."}
