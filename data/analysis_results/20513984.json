{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex-style apartment with split-level design, recessed LED lighting, and contemporary finishes throughout. Major baby safety concern: interior stairs with no visible railings or gates pose a significant fall hazard for crawling infants/toddlers. Good natural light from large windows, clean condition with polished floors and modern kitchen, but the stair access between levels would require childproofing."}
