{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Brand new or nearly new modern apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, LED cove lighting, modern light fixtures, split AC, video intercom, and a sleek enclosed kitchen with built-in oven. The balcony has glass panel railings which are a baby safety concern as a toddler could potentially climb on the lower horizontal rail or push against the glass; the balcony door should be kept locked. The unit is unfurnished with generous natural light from floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors, very clean, and on the 10th floor of a 15-story building which almost certainly has an elevator."}
