The unit is extremely clean with light wood flooring and minimalist aesthetic. Baby safety concern: the balcony has glass railings that appear climbable and relatively low - would require child-proofing. The glass coffee table also has sharp corners. Good natural light from large windows, includes washing machine and AC on balcony."}
