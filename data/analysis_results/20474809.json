{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment with ornate classical crown molding and recessed lighting, clean polished tile floors throughout, and multiple rooms including a large living area and bedroom with wardrobe. The unit appears clean but dated with an older Taiwanese decorative style rather than modern finishes. For baby safety, the slippery high-gloss tile floors are a concern, and the sparse furnishing with folding metal chairs suggests minimal livability; natural light is moderate from several windows but views appear to face neighboring buildings closely. At 4F with no elevator confirmed, carrying a stroller up stairs could be a significant daily inconvenience."}
