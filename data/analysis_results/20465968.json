{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is clearly a ground-floor commercial/storefront space, NOT a residential apartment. It has a large street-facing glass storefront door, drop ceiling with commercial fluorescent lighting, and an empty rectangular layout typical of a shop or office. The space is completely unfurnished with exposed conduit along baseboards. Totally unsuitable for a couple with a baby — it lacks any residential character, has no kitchen, no visible windows besides the storefront, and the glass door opens directly onto the street with scooters parked outside, posing serious safety concerns for a child."}
