{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 3-bedroom apartment in Zhongzheng district with a large living/dining area featuring polished tile floors, built-in shelving, and wall-mounted AC; bedrooms have hardwood flooring but are furnished with mismatched, basic furniture and single beds - the master bed is only a double. At 3F of a 4-story walkup with no elevator, carrying a stroller and baby up stairs daily would be inconvenient; windows have security grilles which are good for child safety, but the overall condition is dated with aging walls and the description is suspiciously sparse (just a generic agent ad), suggesting it may be an agent-listed property with additional fees."}
