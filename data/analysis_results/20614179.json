{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern kitchen featuring gas stove, range hood, and stainless steel refrigerator. Spacious living room with tile flooring, ceiling fan, and good natural light from windows. The apartment appears clean with standard fixtures. For baby safety: the low platform bed frame has no sharp corners, but the kitchen has accessible lower cabinets that would need childproofing. Being on floor 13 of 14 strongly suggests elevator access."}
