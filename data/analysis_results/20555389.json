{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with high-end modern finishes including recessed lighting, marble-look dining table, stylish glass partition kitchen, and quality built-in wardrobes. The open-plan living/dining area is spacious and very clean; a small child's stool visible in the kitchen suggests previous family occupancy. For baby safety, the coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but the glass kitchen sliding door and low electrical outlets would need childproofing. Being on the 1st floor eliminates balcony fall risks but may mean less natural light — the living room appears to rely heavily on artificial lighting with thick curtains drawn over the balcony/patio area."}
