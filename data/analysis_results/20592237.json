{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial or institutional space rather than a residential apartment. The fluorescent grid ceiling lights, large open floor plan with no furniture, internal window cutouts between rooms, and especially the communal bathroom with colorful mosaic tiles, multiple low faucets, and a gendered restroom door sign all strongly suggest this is an office, school, or daycare facility—not a standard apartment. The 55-ping size is unusually large for a residential rental at this price. Not suitable for a couple with a baby as this is not configured as a living space and would require significant conversion work."}
