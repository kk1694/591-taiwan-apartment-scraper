{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with high-end finishes including marble-look wall tiles, crystal chandelier, and contemporary furniture. The unit appears clean with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows and a small balcony. For baby safety, note the glass sliding door to the balcony and the bar-height counter with tall stools; the furniture has relatively rounded edges. Being on 4F of a 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
