{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a dated, older-style apartment with dark wood paneling, parquet flooring, and heavy traditional furnishings from likely the 1980s-90s. The unit is very spacious at 66 ping but appears cluttered with covered furniture, stacked boxes, and plastic-wrapped items suggesting it may be a storage situation or recently vacated. For a couple with a baby, concerns include the old parquet flooring which may have gaps, the heavy traditional round dining table and chairs with hard edges, limited natural light due to vertical blinds and window bars, and an overall musty/dated aesthetic that would require significant cleanup and likely furniture replacement to be livable."}
