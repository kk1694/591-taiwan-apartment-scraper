{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern unfurnished apartment with polished tile floors, split AC units, and large windows providing good natural light. The unit appears to be in a newer high-rise building (4F/15F suggests elevator access). For baby safety, the floors are smooth and easy to clean, no visible stairs or dangerous railings, though the highly polished floors could be slippery; windows have proper frames but low-set designs would need childproofing once baby becomes mobile."}
