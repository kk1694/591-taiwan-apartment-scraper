{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment in a modern high-rise building (2F/14F) with clean polished tile floors, white walls, AC units, and a bathroom with bathtub. The balcony has glass panel railings which are a baby safety concern as a toddler could potentially climb on the lower rail or ledge; the bathtub also requires supervision. Good natural light from windows in bedrooms and balcony. The unit appears clean and well-maintained but completely empty, so it will need full furnishing. Nearby construction visible from balcony could mean noise."}
