{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained modern apartment with recessed lighting, marble countertops, large tile flooring in the living area, and hardwood flooring in the bedroom. The unit features glass sliding partition doors between rooms, built-in storage shelving, AC units, and an intercom system. For baby safety, the glass partition with low open shelving between the bedroom and living room would need childproofing, and the marble step-up at the entryway is a minor trip hazard; however, no dangerous balcony railings or stairs are visible. Good natural light from multiple windows on a high floor (11F) in Songshan district."}
