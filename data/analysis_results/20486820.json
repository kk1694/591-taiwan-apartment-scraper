{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older, unfurnished apartment with dated parquet wood flooring showing visible wear and dark staining. The kitchen has basic tile work and older stainless steel cabinets with a gas stove setup. The rear balcony has low metal railings that are a serious baby safety concern, and the narrow corridor-style balcony with an outdoor sink area looks worn. The apartment is spacious at 31.5 ping but on the 3rd floor of a 4-story walk-up with no elevator, which would be difficult with a stroller and baby. Natural light appears limited in the main living area."}
