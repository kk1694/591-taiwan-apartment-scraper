{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, recently renovated apartment with modern minimalist furnishings, white kitchen with new cabinetry and appliances, and a well-lit bedroom with zebra blinds. Listed by Elegant Realty (expat housing agent). Good natural light from large windows in the living room. For baby safety, the coffee/side tables have some sharp edges and the low platform bed frame has exposed corners that may need padding; no visible balcony railings or stairs, which is positive. Overall in excellent condition with no red flags, though at 25 ping the space may feel snug for a growing family."}
