{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained upscale apartment with modern LED ambient lighting, wood flooring, and quality dark wood cabinetry throughout. Very spacious living room and formal dining area with chandelier. For baby safety, the rounded coffee table edges are good, but the hard tile kitchen floor and lack of visible outlet covers may need attention. Natural light appears moderate through large windows with greenery views."}
