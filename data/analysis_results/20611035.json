{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang", "notes": "High-end modern apartment with premium finishes including marble TV wall, light wood flooring, recessed lighting, central AC, designer pendant lights, and sleek black glass partition/storage walls. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) at 55 ping on 9F/14F, so an elevator is virtually certain. For baby safety, the large glass partition walls and sharp-cornered marble dining table are concerns; however the open floor plan with smooth wood floors is generally baby-friendly and the large windows provide excellent natural light."}
