{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with European-style décor, crystal chandeliers, crown molding, and marble-look flooring in living areas with hardwood in bedrooms. The glass coffee table in the living room has sharp edges which is a concern for a crawling baby; the unit appears very clean with good natural light from wide windows. At 41 ping this is spacious for a family, managed by Hoyuan Real Estate Agency (禾源外商租屋管理公司) suggesting it is marketed to foreigners, but the 5th floor with no visible elevator evidence is worth confirming."}
