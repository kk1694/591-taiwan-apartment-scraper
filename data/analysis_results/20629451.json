{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment in a newer building with high ceilings, clean white floors, built-in wood-panel TV unit, kitchenette with white cabinets, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. The building appears to have an elevator (exit sign visible, modern corridor). For baby safety, the balcony has railings visible through the windows that appear reasonably spaced but would need checking; the space is quite open and minimally furnished with smooth floors, which is good. At 22.59 ping and NT$58,000/month in Xinyi, the listing appears to show multiple small studio-style rooms rather than one large unit — possibly a subdivided suite — which may feel cramped for a couple with a baby despite the stated size."}
