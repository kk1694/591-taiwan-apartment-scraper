{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxury high-end apartment with excellent natural light, modern recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, and contemporary furniture. The open layout is spacious and clean with glass coffee tables that have sharp corners to consider for baby safety; balcony access visible in images should be checked for secure railings. Being on 11F/11F of an 11-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
