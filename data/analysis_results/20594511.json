{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with dated wooden furniture and fixtures from the 90s-2000s era. The unit is clean with good natural light from multiple windows, and the high floor (10F) in a 14-floor building strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is good, but the tile floors may be slippery; no visible balcony railings to assess, and furniture corners appear rounded but some sharp edges on the wooden cabinet and desk should be child-proofed."}
