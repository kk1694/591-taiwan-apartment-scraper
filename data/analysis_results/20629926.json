{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shuhai (樹海) community, Beitou", "notes": "Clean, unfurnished 3-bedroom apartment in a modern high-rise building (2F/14F) with glass balcony railings, polished tile floors, and AC units pre-installed. The balcony has glass panel railings which are a baby safety concern as a toddler could climb or press against them; the apartment is otherwise spacious with no interior stairs or sharp corners visible. Bedrooms have good natural light from large windows with security bars, and the bathroom is clean with modern tiling and a separate shower enclosure, though the unit comes completely empty so all furnishing would be needed."}
