{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with contemporary furnishings, large windows providing good natural light, and polished tile floors. The unit includes a loft bedroom area with low ceiling which could be a concern for a crawling/walking baby due to fall risk from the loft edge. Furniture has relatively rounded edges but the hard tile floors and floor-to-ceiling windows should be baby-proofed."}
