{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older apartment from the 1990s-2000s era with dated wood-tone cabinetry, wallpaper borders, and fluorescent lighting throughout. The unit appears clean but worn, with dark hardwood floors showing some age. For baby safety, the raised platform bed area poses a fall risk, and the bathroom opens directly to bedrooms with hard tile floors; no dangerous balconies visible. Natural light appears limited with small windows, and the overall decor feels tired and needs updating."}
