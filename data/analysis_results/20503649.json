{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Longcheng Market", "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including window AC unit and basic light fixtures. The unit is unfurnished with clean white tile floors and appears spacious at 50 ping. Building exterior shows age with visible staining. For baby safety, the flat layout is good with no visible stairs, but exposed electrical cords along baseboards need attention. Natural light appears limited based on the heavy curtains covering windows."}
