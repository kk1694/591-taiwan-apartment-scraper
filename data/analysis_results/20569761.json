{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious luxury apartment in excellent condition with polished marble/stone floors in living areas and hardwood in bedrooms, recessed ceiling AC, large floor-to-ceiling windows providing abundant natural light, and a landscaped balcony/terrace with greenery. The 21-story building almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the polished stone floors are very slippery and the large sliding glass doors to the terrace would need child locks; no stairs visible and corners appear rounded, but the unfurnished state means sharp furniture edges are not yet a concern. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout, number of rooms, and included appliances before committing at NT$100K/month."}
