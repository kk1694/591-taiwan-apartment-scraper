{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with modern recessed lighting, split AC units, polished marble-look tile floors, and a fully equipped kitchen with walnut-tone cabinetry and large refrigerator. The living area is very open with large windows providing good natural light and greenery views. For baby safety, the marble coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the rear balcony/laundry area has metal security grilles which are good for safety but the space is narrow and utilitarian with older tile flooring. The 13-story building on the 4th floor very likely has an elevator, and at 48 ping this is a generously sized family apartment in clean condition with no major red flags."}
