{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new, unfurnished apartment in a modern high-rise building with elegant lobby and landscaped grounds. The unit features polished tile floors, modern black-framed windows, a new kitchen with gas stove and range hood (still wrapped in protective plastic), clean modern bathroom with glass shower partition, and a spacious balcony with washer hookups and AC outdoor unit. For baby safety, the balcony has metal bar railings which are good, but the glass shower partition in the bathroom and the hard tile floors throughout would need attention; the unit is completely empty so there are no sharp furniture corners to worry about initially. Excellent natural light from large windows, impeccably clean new-construction condition with no red flags."}
