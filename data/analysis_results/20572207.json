{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with 2 bedrooms, clean tiled floors, fitted kitchen with fridge and washing machine, and a bathroom with bathtub. The raised platform area in the living room and the glass coffee table with sharp metal edges are baby safety concerns; the bedroom windows appear to have secure frames but should be checked for child locks. Good natural light from large bay windows in both bedrooms, and the 15-story building on floor 6 almost certainly has an elevator."}
