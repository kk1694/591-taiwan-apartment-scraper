{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Older but well-maintained apartment managed by UR House rental agency. The living room is spacious with large windows providing good natural light, L-shaped sofa, TV unit, and wall-mounted AC. Two bedrooms are modest in size with windows and built-in wardrobes. The building appears to be an older walk-up (3F of 4F with no elevator visible, typical older Taipei construction with window security bars). For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the windows have security grilles which is a plus. Walls show some aging/discoloration but overall the unit is clean and functional at 29.46 ping."}
