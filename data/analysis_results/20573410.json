{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, crystal light fixtures, modern kitchen with marble backsplash and gas stove, wall-mounted AC, and intercom system. The 15-floor building on the 3rd floor almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are very slippery, the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom could be a concern, and the kitchen has a glass door leading to what appears to be a rear balcony area — all worth checking in person. The apartment is completely empty/unfurnished so you would need to furnish everything, but the blank canvas and generous 31.89 ping size is great for a growing family."}
