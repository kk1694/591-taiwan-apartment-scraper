{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near a park with playground", "notes": "Older building with recently refreshed light wood laminate flooring and freshly painted white walls, but the building structure, window frames, and exposed AC piping indicate an aged property. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at 32 ping with a nice bay window area providing decent natural light. For baby safety, the 3rd floor walkup with no confirmed elevator is a concern for stroller access; the bay window area has a low ledge that would need childproofing. A nearby park with a playground is a plus for families. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag—ask for more details on layout and amenities."}
