{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylishly renovated apartment with modern track lighting, white brick accent wall, light wood flooring, and contemporary furniture including a sofa, dining set, and flat-screen TV. The space appears clean and well-maintained with a separate kitchen area visible through a doorway. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is a plus, but the low TV console with sharp metal edges and the small bench-style dining seating would need childproofing; no balcony is visible in the photos. At 10F/12F in Da'an district, an elevator is very likely. Only the living/dining area is shown — no bedroom or bathroom photos are available, which is a minor red flag as it limits full assessment of the space."}
