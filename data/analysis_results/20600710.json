{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious apartment (36 ping) with polished hardwood floors, recessed lighting, and ceiling-mounted AC units. The interior is clean but dated with older-style furniture (ornate sofa set, marble coffee table) suggesting a renovation from 10-15 years ago rather than truly modern. At 2F of a 6-floor walk-up building (likely no elevator), the marble coffee table with sharp corners and glass shelf units in the bedroom are baby safety concerns. Natural light appears moderate from the windows, and the open floor plan with large living area provides good space for a family."}
