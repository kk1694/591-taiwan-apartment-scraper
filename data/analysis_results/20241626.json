{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale modern apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, sleek black marble TV console, designer leather sofa, and open kitchen with breakfast bar. The unit is very spacious at 30 ping with excellent natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the highly polished tile floors are slippery, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, and the raised TV console platform is a tripping/climbing hazard; no bedrooms or balconies are shown so railing safety cannot be assessed. The unit is very clean and well-maintained but only shows living areas — no bedroom, bathroom, or kitchen details are visible, which is a red flag for such a high-priced listing."}
