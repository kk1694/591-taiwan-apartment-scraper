{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, modern kitchen with built-in appliances and LG refrigerator, and good natural light through large windows with curtains. The building appears to be a newer high-rise (3F/20F) in Zhongzheng district with a well-landscaped courtyard and covered entrance area. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery but easy to clean; no visible balcony access or dangerous railings in the photos, and the open floor plan with rounded crown molding is relatively baby-friendly, though corner guards would be recommended on the dark baseboards."}
