{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed lighting, light wood flooring, and open-plan living/kitchen layout. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking greenery. For baby safety: the raised bar counter with metal stools may need childproofing, and the low glass coffee table has sharp corners. Overall very clean and well-maintained with no obvious red flags."}
