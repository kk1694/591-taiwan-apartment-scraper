{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "泰興大廈 (Tai Xing Building), Wanhua District", "notes": "Dated apartment with heavy dark wood paneling, old-style window AC unit, and ornate 1980s-90s era decor including decorative wall-mounted owls and arched display cabinets. The building (泰興大廈) has an elevator with 24H surveillance, but the common areas show their age with old green tile walls. For a baby, the sharp corners on the wooden wainscoting and heavy ornate front door are concerns; only one room is shown (unfurnished living area) so kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom conditions are unknown — a major red flag given the limited photos and near-empty listing description."}
