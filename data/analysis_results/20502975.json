{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean white cabinetry, wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, and new appliances including range hood and AC units. Open-plan layout is spacious with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: no visible stairs, furniture has rounded corners on the dining table, but the low coffee table edges and TV stand would need attention; no balcony visible in photos which is safer for a toddler."}
