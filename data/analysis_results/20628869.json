{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with a European-style white interior, faux brick accent walls, decorative moldings, and modern amenities including AC, large TV, and dehumidifier. The space appears clean with tile flooring throughout. For baby safety, the organic-shaped coffee table has rounded edges which is positive, but the glass display cabinet and decorative rose panel divider could pose risks; a bedroom visible through a doorway appears to have a low mattress on the floor near a window/balcony that would need childproofing. At floor 11/13, an elevator is very likely present."}
