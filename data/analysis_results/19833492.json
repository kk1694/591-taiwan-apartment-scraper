{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including marble accent walls, recessed lighting, and designer furniture. Very clean and well-maintained with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: the space appears safe with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings, but the sharp corners on the coffee table and low furniture may need padding. Being on floor 9 of 9 suggests a newer building likely with elevator, but not confirmed in images."}
