{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment in excellent condition with clean white tile flooring, wall-mounted TV, and contemporary kitchen with built-in appliances. Good natural light from large windows. The balcony has metal security grilles which provide baby safety, but the kitchen has a gas stovetop that would need childproofing. Overall very clean and well-maintained with no visible red flags."}
