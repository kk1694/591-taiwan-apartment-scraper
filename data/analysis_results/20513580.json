{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/office space rather than a residential apartment. The space features an industrial-style black painted exposed ceiling with track lighting, an emergency exit sign, and a large open-plan layout with no visible bedroom or bathroom partitions — more typical of a studio, gallery, or office. There is only a minimal kitchenette sink with dangling exposed wires from the ceiling, and the windows appear to have frosted/obscured glass limiting natural light. Completely unsuitable for a couple with a baby: no proper kitchen, no visible bathroom, exposed wiring, and the commercial layout would require significant renovation to function as a livable home."}
