{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Very well-maintained modern apartment with high-end finishes including marble TV accent wall, recessed LED lighting, polished tile flooring in common areas, and hardwood flooring in bedrooms. The spacious living room has large windows with greenery views providing good natural light. At 77.94 ping this is a large unit with at least 2 bedrooms, a dining area, and ample built-in storage. For baby safety, the glass dining table has sharp corners, the master bedroom has a sliding glass door to what appears to be a balcony that should be checked for railing safety, and the polished tile floors in the living area can be slippery — but overall the apartment is clean, well-organized, and very suitable for a family."}
