{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylish studio/loft apartment with high ceilings, built-in cabinetry, LED accent lighting, wood-look flooring, and a mezzanine loft accessed by a ladder. The unit is clean and well-designed with a kitchenette, washing machine, dining counter, and full-size bed on the main level. Major baby safety concern: the metal ladder to the loft area is completely open with no gate or barrier, and the loft has no visible railing — this is dangerous for a crawling/toddling child. The space is essentially one open room (studio layout) which may feel cramped for a couple with a baby at 14 ping, and the high bar-style dining chairs are not child-friendly."}
