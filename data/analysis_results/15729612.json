{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed LED lighting, split AC units, and new appliances throughout. The living area has clean light-toned flooring and a raised platform bedroom with a brand-new mattress still in plastic wrap; the raised platform edge in the bedroom is a minor tripping/fall hazard for a crawling baby. Multiple windows provide decent natural light though views face neighboring buildings. No balcony visible which is actually safer for a child, and the 2nd floor in an older 7-story building likely means no elevator — confirm before committing."}
