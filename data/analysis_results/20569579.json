{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Very spacious unfurnished apartment (71.56 ping) with dark hardwood floors throughout, crown molding, and older-style light fixtures. The unit is clean but dated, with an older wall-mounted AC unit and traditional Taiwanese interior styling from the 2000s era. There is a balcony accessible via sliding doors with green-tinted glass railings that would need baby-proofing; the balcony door latches should be checked for child safety. Good natural light from multiple windows, and the open floor plan with no visible stairs is positive for baby safety, though the hard wood floors and low electrical outlets at baseboard level are concerns to address."}
