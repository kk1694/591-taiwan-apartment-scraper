{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment managed by UR HOUSE rental service. Features marble accent walls, recessed lighting, light wood laminate flooring throughout, a sleek kitchen with Bosch appliances and induction cooktop, and at least 2-3 bedrooms (one empty room could serve as a nursery). The balcony has railings visible in image 3 which would need baby-proofing; the round coffee table in the living room has no sharp corners which is positive. Being on 5F/5F (top floor) with no confirmed elevator is a significant concern for carrying a stroller and baby up five flights of stairs, and the top floor may also have heat/leak issues."}
