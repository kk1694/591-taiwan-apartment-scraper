{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white/beige finishes, recessed lighting, and contemporary furnishings. The unit features good natural light from large windows with balcony access. For baby safety, the red bar stools have slippery chrome bases and sharp edges, and the balcony railing spacing should be checked; the overall open floor plan with minimal sharp corners is relatively baby-friendly. Video intercom system and central air conditioning indicate a quality building."}
