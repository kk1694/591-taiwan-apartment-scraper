{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated 1-bedroom apartment in Da'an with modern finishes including recessed LED lighting, herringbone tile backsplash, built-in cabinetry, and quality wood furniture. The space is very clean and well-maintained with an open kitchen/living layout. For baby safety, the bedroom has large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to what appears to be a balcony area that would need childproofing; the coffee table has sharp corners worth padding. Being on the 6th of 7 floors with no elevator info, this could be a walk-up which would be challenging with a stroller and baby. Natural light appears moderate — the living room relies on frosted glass from the bedroom, while the bedroom gets decent light from the large windows."}
