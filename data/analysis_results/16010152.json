{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with light wood-tone flooring, recessed LED lighting, split AC units, and a minimalist grey-toned interior. The space is very clean with an open living area, separate bedroom, and a small entryway kitchen area. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is a plus, and the floors appear smooth and easy to clean; however, natural light appears limited with small windows, and being on 4F of a 5F walkup with no confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller and baby. The description is minimal (agent listing placeholder) so further details on layout and amenities should be confirmed directly."}
