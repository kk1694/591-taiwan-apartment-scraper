{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with designer finishes including sculpted ceiling, recessed lighting, open-plan living/kitchen with breakfast bar, hardwood floors in bedrooms, and clean bathroom with glass-enclosed shower. At least 3 rooms visible (master bedroom with TV/AC/concrete accent wall, a smaller bedroom with single bed suitable as nursery, and an empty room). Good natural light from large windows with greenery views. For baby safety: no visible balcony or dangerous railings, windows appear secured, but the glass shower partition and hard tile/stone kitchen countertop edges could be concerns. The 18-story building on 7F almost certainly has an elevator. Overall clean and move-in ready, though the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag."}
