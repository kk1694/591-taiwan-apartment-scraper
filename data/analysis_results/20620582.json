{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with high-end minimalist designer interior, LED cove lighting, built-in ceiling AC, modern kitchen with glossy cabinetry, wall-mounted TV, and light wood laminate flooring throughout. The space is very clean and stylish but appears to be a well-designed 1-bedroom layout at 25 ping; for a couple with a baby, the open-plan living/dining/kitchen area has rounded furniture (good for baby safety) but limited space for baby gear. Natural light appears limited based on photos (mostly artificial lighting visible), and no balcony or windows are prominently shown, which is worth verifying; the 14-floor building on floor 4 almost certainly has an elevator."}
