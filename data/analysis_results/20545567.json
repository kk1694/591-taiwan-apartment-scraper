{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment in excellent condition with clean minimalist design, polished tile floors, modern furniture, and split AC units. The balcony has proper railings visible through floor-to-ceiling windows; living area has rounded furniture with minimal sharp corners, making it reasonably baby-safe. Good natural light from large windows with mountain views. Being on 12F of a 12-floor building strongly suggests elevator access."}
