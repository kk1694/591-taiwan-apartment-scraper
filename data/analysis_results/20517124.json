{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Lin Sen South Road, near Shandao Temple MRT (185m)", "notes": "Well-located 3BR/2BA unit on 4F of 12F elevator building, very close to MRT. Fully furnished with appliances. No pets allowed. Cannot assess modernity or baby safety features (balcony railings, sharp corners) without seeing actual photos. The balcony and being on 4th floor are considerations for child safety."}
