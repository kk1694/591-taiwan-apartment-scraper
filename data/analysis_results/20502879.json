The space is well-maintained with a separate bedroom featuring large windows for good natural light. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and there appears to be a balcony area in the bedroom that should be checked for railing safety. No visible stairs, and the overall cleanliness is excellent."}
