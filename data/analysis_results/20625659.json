{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with recessed lighting, split AC units, marble coffee table, and quality furnishings. The living space is clean with tile flooring and the bedroom has hardwood floors with good natural light. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need edge guards, but overall the flat layout with no visible stairs is suitable for a young family."}
