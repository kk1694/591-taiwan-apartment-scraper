{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with mixed flooring (tile in living areas, hardwood in bedroom). The unit is clean and well-maintained but features dated decor including wooden ceiling beams and older window-unit AC. For baby safety, the balcony has standard metal railings which may need childproofing, and there are no visible stairs. Good natural light from multiple windows and balcony access."}
