{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Upscale modern apartment on the 15th floor of an 18-story building with high-end finishes including recessed LED cove lighting, polished tile and hardwood flooring, leather sectional sofa, stone accent wall, and large panoramic windows with mountain views providing excellent natural light. The unit is very spacious at ~63 ping, appears clean and well-maintained with no visible clutter; windows appear to be fixed or have secure frames which is positive for baby safety, no balconies visible in the photos, and the open floor plan with rounded furniture edges reduces hazard risk, though the glass coffee table with sharp metal legs would need baby-proofing. Note: the listing description is minimal (just a promotional agent message) which is a minor red flag — request full details on layout and amenities directly."}
