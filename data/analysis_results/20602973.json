{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious furnished apartment in Zhongshan with modern recessed lighting, central AC, white leather L-shaped sofa, full kitchen with gas stove, washing machine, and dining area. The unit appears clean with tile flooring and a generally open layout, though natural light seems limited as no exterior windows are prominently visible in the photos. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the kitchen is open-plan without barriers, so the gas stove area would need to be gated off; no balcony or stairs are visible which is a plus."}
