{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with brand-new modern finishes including marble-look TV feature wall with LED accent lighting, light wood-tone flooring, recessed lighting throughout, and clean white walls. The unit is completely unfurnished and appears freshly renovated in excellent condition. Being on the top floor (4F/4F) of a low-rise building with no elevator is a significant concern for a pregnant woman and later carrying a baby plus stroller up four flights of stairs. The balcony has metal railings visible through sliding glass doors which would need child-proofing later; overall the flat open layout with no stairs inside is baby-friendly, but the lack of kitchen/bathroom photos and the very sparse listing description (agent cross-promotion only) are minor red flags."}
