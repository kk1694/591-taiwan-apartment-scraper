{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, recently renovated studio with murphy bed, built-in desk, washer-dryer combo, stainless steel fridge, kitchenette, and AC. Clean and well-maintained with light wood flooring. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency). However, at only 11 ping this is a compact studio — very tight for a couple with a baby. The murphy bed mechanism and small open kitchen with exposed appliances could pose baby safety concerns. Natural light appears limited with roller blinds covering what seem to be the only windows."}
