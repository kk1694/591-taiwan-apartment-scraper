{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment from likely 1980s-90s with dated fixtures, tile floors, and window-mounted AC unit. The bathroom and kitchen show significant age with discolored grout and older-style cabinets. Being on 5F/5F with no visible elevator indicators is a concern. Large open layout is baby-friendly but balcony access and tile floors require childproofing. Good natural light through large sliding glass doors."}
