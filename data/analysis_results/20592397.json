{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated luxury apartment with high-end finishes including marble-style kitchen island countertop, Hitachi refrigerator, built-in dishwasher, recessed lighting, and designer furniture. The open-plan living area has clean lines with minimal sharp corners, and the bedroom features wood flooring with good natural light; being on floor 10/10 (top floor) the windows have city views but the kitchen island corners and glass partition door between bedroom and adjacent room could pose baby safety concerns. The unit appears very clean and move-in ready, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder) which is a minor red flag — verify actual terms directly."}
