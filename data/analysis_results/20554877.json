{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including track lighting, recessed ceiling AC, glass partition walls, open-concept kitchen with breakfast bar, and light wood flooring throughout. At least 2 bedrooms with brand-new mattresses; the second bedroom has a sloped ceiling suggesting it may be near the roofline (4F/5F). Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light with mountain views. For baby safety, the living room windows have metal railings but the glass partitions have sharp black metal frames that could be a concern; the spacious open layout is otherwise very baby-friendly with no visible stairs on this level. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), so details on elevator, parking, or lease terms are unknown — worth confirming given it is floor 4 of 5 with no elevator indication."}
