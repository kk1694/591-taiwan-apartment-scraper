{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end studio apartment in a luxury building with rooftop pool. The unit features stylish geometric pendant lights, recessed lighting, split AC, floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors to a balcony with proper metal railings, built-in wardrobes, and light wood flooring throughout. For baby safety, the balcony has railings but the sliding glass doors provide good containment; the open-plan layout lacks sharp corners and the smooth flooring is easy to clean. Being on floor 12 of 12 in a building with a rooftop pool confirms elevator access; however, this appears to be a studio/1-room layout which may feel tight for a couple with a baby at 16.58 ping."}
