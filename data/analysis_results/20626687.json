{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin, near mountains (likely Yangmingshan area)", "notes": "Very spacious luxury apartment (72 ping) with European classical-style furniture and marble accents, but the decor feels dated rather than modern. Excellent natural light from large panoramic windows with mountain/greenery views. For baby safety: the marble coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the open kitchen area visible in image 4 shows a balcony with metal railings that should be checked for gap width; the hardwood floors throughout are a plus for a crawling baby. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — no details on layout, rooms, or amenities despite the high NT$48,000 price."}
