{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean studio-style apartment with recessed LED lighting, wall-mounted AC, washing machine, microwave, fridge, TV, and a small kitchenette area. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and hard tile floors are baby safety concerns; the bedroom area is separated only by a curtain rather than a door, offering limited room separation for a family. At 23 ping on the 9th floor of a 15-story building (very likely has elevator), natural light comes from one window — the space feels compact but well-maintained, though quite small for a couple with a baby."}
