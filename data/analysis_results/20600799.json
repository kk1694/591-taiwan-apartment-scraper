{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment (32 ping) in Zhongzheng with dated tile flooring, traditional wooden furniture, and basic fixtures — functional but not renovated. The balcony has iron railings with wide gaps that are a significant baby safety concern and would need childproofing; the glass coffee table with sharp corners is also a hazard. Natural light appears limited from the balcony side only, and the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — managed by UR HOUSE, a foreigner-friendly agency."}
