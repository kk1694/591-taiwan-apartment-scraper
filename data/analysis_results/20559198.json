{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment with older-style decorative wooden beam ceiling and dated kitchen with HCG brand fixtures. The living area has clean white tile floors and good natural light from balcony sliding doors. The balcony has metal security grilles which are good for baby safety, but the kitchen is narrow and the overall style is from the 1990s-2000s era; being on 2F without confirmed elevator could be manageable with a stroller but worth verifying."}
