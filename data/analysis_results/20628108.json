{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with marble TV feature wall, built-in display cabinets, polished tile floors, and elegant lighting fixtures. The unit has a split-level/loft design with stairs visible in image 4, which is a significant baby safety concern - the stairs appear to have no gate and could be dangerous for a crawling infant. The glass shelving in the display cabinet also poses a risk. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with curtains. The living area is spacious and clean, and the bedroom has warm wood flooring with AC. Being on 10F of a 14F building strongly suggests elevator access. Overall a high-quality unit in a desirable Da'an location, but the internal stairs require childproofing."}
