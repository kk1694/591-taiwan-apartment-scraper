{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin", "notes": "Upscale modern apartment in a luxury residential building with excellent amenities including rooftop swimming pool, rooftop garden with pergolas, and a well-equipped fitness center. The living room is spacious with hardwood flooring, recessed lighting, modern furniture, and wood-panel accent walls; natural light enters through curtained windows. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need padding, and the rooftop pool area is a significant hazard requiring supervision; however the interior appears very clean and well-maintained with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings. Being on 6F/7F of a building with these amenities strongly suggests elevator access; managed by UR HOUSE, a foreign-friendly rental agency."}
