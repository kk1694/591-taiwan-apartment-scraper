{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older building with textured ceiling tiles and crown molding suggesting 1990s-era construction, but reasonably maintained with dark hardwood floors and updated furniture. The open kitchen has a raised counter/bar area with a step-up transition between kitchen tile and living room hardwood that could be a tripping hazard for a crawling baby. Natural light appears limited with small windows and security grilles; the spacious 39-ping layout is good for a family, but the slightly dated condition and window bars on a 2F unit without confirmed elevator access are worth noting."}
