{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, modern recessed lighting, laminate wood flooring, and new furnishings across multiple rooms. The unit appears to be subdivided into several individual rooms (possibly a shared apartment or suite-style rental at 30 ping), each with a bed, wardrobe, and AC — one room is very narrow with a single bed crammed next to a desk area. No balcony visible but windows have frosted/textured glass limiting natural light; being on 3F of a 4F walk-up building with no elevator could be inconvenient with a stroller and baby. Baby safety concerns are minimal as rooms appear flat and self-contained, though the narrow room layout and lack of visible kitchen/bathroom in photos warrant further inquiry."}
