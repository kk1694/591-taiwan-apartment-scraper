{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with clean tile flooring, recessed LED lighting, and a crystal chandelier. Large glass partition walls give an open feel with good natural light. Listed by UR HOUSE (a foreign-friendly rental agency). For baby safety, the large glass panels could be a concern if not tempered/safety glass, and the unfurnished space has hard tile floors throughout. The 47.8 ping size is very spacious for a family. No visible balcony railings or stairs in this image."}
