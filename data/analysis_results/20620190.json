{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated traditional wooden furniture and 1990s-style decor. Living room has balcony access which may need baby-proofing. Bathroom is functional but aging with a bathtub that requires safety rails already installed, though the space is cramped. The unit appears clean but shows wear; glass coffee table corners and heavy wooden cabinets pose potential hazards for a crawling baby."}
