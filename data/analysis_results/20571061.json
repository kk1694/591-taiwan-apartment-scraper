{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a ground-floor commercial or mixed-use storefront space, not a residential apartment. The exterior shows a metal rolling shutter door and glass entrance typical of a shop or office. Interior has polished dark granite floors, exposed concrete ceilings, an emergency exit sign, and a prominent staircase taking up significant floor area — it resembles an empty commercial shell rather than a livable home. Major baby safety concerns include the open staircase with traditional railings a child could slip through, hard stone floors, and the lack of any residential fixtures (no kitchen, no bedroom areas visible). Not recommended for a family — this is essentially a raw commercial space on the ground floor of a 3-story building in Wenshan."}
