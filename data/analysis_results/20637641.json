{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end luxury apartment with designer finishes including marble TV wall, recessed LED lighting, upholstered wall panels, and stylish furnishings throughout. The 15-floor building on the 5th floor almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the marble coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, the dining chairs have thin metal legs a toddler could trip on, and the bedroom has floor-to-ceiling glass doors/windows that appear to lead to a balcony requiring child locks. Natural light appears limited based on photos taken at night, but large windows are present. The description is minimal (just an agent ad from Sung-Hsin Real Estate), so layout details and room count are unclear despite the generous 29 ping size."}
