{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated yellow tile flooring throughout, window-unit AC, and basic ceiling light fixtures. The unit is unfurnished and spacious (34 ping) but clearly from an older building with no modern renovations. The balcony has glass windows and metal grid barriers which provide reasonable baby safety, but the hard tile floors throughout and black baseboard trim with sharp edges are concerns for a crawling baby. Natural light appears limited with small high-set windows in the main rooms; the bathroom visible in one photo looks dated. At 6F with no elevator confirmed, carrying a stroller up could be a significant issue."}
