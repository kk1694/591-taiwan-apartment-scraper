{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in very clean condition with modern furnishings including L-shaped leather sofa, flat-screen TV, stylish light fixtures, split AC units, and built-in sliding-door wardrobe. The living area appears spacious with a large floor mirror, but being on 12F/12F (top floor) raises concerns about potential roof leaks and heat; only 5 photos shown are of living room and one bedroom with no kitchen or bathroom visible. For baby safety, the wire-frame side tables have sharp geometric edges and the large unsecured floor mirror is a tipping hazard; natural light appears decent from window with sheer curtains near the entrance."}
