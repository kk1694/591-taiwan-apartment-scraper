{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with dated wood furniture (entertainment center, ornate desk) and basic finishes. Clean tile floors throughout with reasonable natural light from windows. For baby safety: no visible balcony hazards in photos, single-level layout is good, but hard tile floors would benefit from area rugs; the furniture has some sharp corners that may need padding."}
