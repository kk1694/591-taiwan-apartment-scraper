{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "The living/dining area has been recently renovated with new laminate flooring, recessed lighting, and modern furniture, but the kitchen reveals the building's true age with old white tile walls, dated brown tile flooring, an aging range hood, and basic gas stove setup. Being on 4F/4F with no elevator is a significant concern for a couple expecting a baby, as carrying a stroller and infant up four flights will be exhausting. Natural light appears limited with small windows behind security bars; the drop ceiling suggests a somewhat cramped feel despite the 30-ping size."}
