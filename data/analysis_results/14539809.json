{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with recessed lighting, light wood flooring, open-plan living/dining/kitchen, en-suite bedroom with attached bathroom, and a spacious main bathroom with bathtub. Very clean and move-in ready condition with good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the coffee table has a metal frame with potential sharp edges, the kitchen is open-plan without barriers, and the bathtub area lacks a non-slip mat; no visible balcony railings or stairs to worry about, and the flat single-level layout is ideal for a crawling baby."}
