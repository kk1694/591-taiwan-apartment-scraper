{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including white marble-look tiles, split AC units, sleek kitchen with water filtration, and stylish gray bathrooms with glass shower enclosures. The smooth tile floors and minimal sharp corners are relatively baby-friendly, though the unit is completely empty and would need furniture. Being on floor 3 of 15 strongly suggests elevator access. Good natural light from windows visible in living areas."}
