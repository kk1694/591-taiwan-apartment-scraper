{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Dapinglin MRT Station, Wenshan District, close to Muzha Riverside Park and Shih Hsin University", "notes": "Large 4BR/2BA apartment (53 ping) on 2F with elevator access, fully furnished with appliances, 2 balconies, and all rooms with windows suggesting good natural light. Pet-friendly and allows cooking with natural gas. For a couple expecting a baby, the 2nd floor with elevator is convenient for stroller access; however, 2 balconies need inspection for railing safety, and the older apartment building type may have less modern baby-proofing features. The broker listing with minimal description is a minor red flag — an in-person viewing is strongly recommended to assess actual condition, cleanliness, and safety details."}
