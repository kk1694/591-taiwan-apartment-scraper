The 7th floor unit in a 22-story building has good natural light from large windows with decorative iron railings that appear secure for baby safety; no visible balcony access, sharp corners are minimal, and the flat open layout is baby-friendly. Listed via An-Ho Real Estate agent; the description is just a generic agent ad with no meaningful property details, which is a minor red flag — request a proper listing description before committing."}
