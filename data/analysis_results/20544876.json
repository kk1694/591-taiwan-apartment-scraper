{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Stylized loft-style apartment with Japanese/traditional wooden beam aesthetic, internal staircase to mezzanine level, and glass partitions. Major baby safety concerns: the open internal staircase with no gate, glass partition walls, and the mezzanine/loft layout pose significant fall risks. The kitchen is basic with older fluorescent lighting and the bathroom features a deep stone soaking tub viewed from above, which is a drowning hazard for a child. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. The 11-story building exterior appears well-maintained and likely has an elevator. Overall the design is more artistic than practical for a family with a baby, and the description is essentially empty (just an agent advertisement), which is a minor red flag."}
