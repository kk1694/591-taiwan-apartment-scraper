{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, split AC units, polished stone tile floors in living/dining areas, and wood-laminate flooring in bedrooms. The large living room has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors to a balcony with adequate railings; the balcony railing height appears standard but should be verified for baby safety. At 71.85 ping this is very large with multiple bedrooms, a separate dining area, and plenty of room for a growing family — no stairs visible, flat single-floor layout, clean condition with good natural light from multiple windows. Being on the 5th floor of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
