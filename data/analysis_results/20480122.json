{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with traditional/classical furniture and finishes rather than modern style. Features recessed lighting, split AC units, and full kitchen with gas stove. Good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: the living room has low coffee table with rounded edges which is good, but the kitchen has accessible lower cabinets and a back utility/balcony area that may need gates; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings in images."}
