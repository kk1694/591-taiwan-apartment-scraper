{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District, near Da Yu Building (大玉樓)", "notes": "Modern building with clean exterior, appears relatively new construction. Interior is unfurnished with polished tile floors in the spacious living area and hardwood floors in bedrooms, built-in closets with frosted glass sliding doors, AC units, and large sliding glass doors to balconies. The 7th floor top-floor unit has good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety: balcony railings appear to be metal horizontal bars which a toddler could potentially climb — verify railing height and spacing; the large open living space with hard tile floors would benefit from play mats. Being on the top floor (7F/7F) may mean heat issues in summer and potential roof leaks; confirm elevator access given the building height of 7 stories (likely has one based on building style)."}
