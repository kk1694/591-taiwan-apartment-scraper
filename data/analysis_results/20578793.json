{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District, Taipei", "notes": "Top floor (4F/4F) of a walkup building with no elevator - carrying a stroller and baby up 4 flights daily will be very tiring. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag suggesting low-effort listing or potential bait. Size is decent at 27 ping for a small family, and Da'an is an excellent district with good amenities, but cannot assess modernity, safety features, or condition without images or a real description."}
