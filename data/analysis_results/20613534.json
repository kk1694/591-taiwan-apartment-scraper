{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Older-style apartment with wooden flooring, crown molding, and traditional light fixtures. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at ~91 sqm with multiple rooms visible. Being on the 3rd floor of a 4-story building likely means no elevator (walk-up). The wooden floors and open layout are decent for a baby, though the sliding glass partition on the left could be a concern; listed through UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly agency). Limited photos make full assessment difficult, and the very short description is a red flag suggesting this may be a placeholder or agent-generated listing."}
