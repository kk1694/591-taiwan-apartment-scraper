{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including recessed LED lighting, black-framed glass partition doors, large-format floor tiles, and contemporary furniture. The living area is clean and well-lit with a separate dining/kitchen zone behind glass partitions; a small study/bedroom has a built-in daybed and desk with natural light from a large window. For baby safety, the round nesting coffee tables have metal edges that could pose a risk, and the glass partition doors would need childproofing. The 14-floor building on the 5th floor almost certainly has an elevator. Only 4 photos provided and no bedroom or bathroom detail visible, and the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request more photos before committing."}
