{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, newly built apartment in very clean condition with polished tile floors, split AC, modern bathroom with glass door, and a textured accent wall. The unit appears to be a 2-room layout with a small living area, separate bedroom, and kitchenette near the entrance. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery; the balcony door in the bedroom should be secured with a child lock, and the low coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. Natural light appears limited based on the photos, with only one visible window/balcony door in the bedroom. Being on the 9th floor of a 15-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator."}
