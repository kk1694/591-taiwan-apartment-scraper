{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with light wood flooring, recessed lighting, split AC units, and built-in wardrobes across at least two bedrooms. Kitchen has a Rinnai gas water heater, gas stovetop, range hood, washing machine, and fridge. Excellent natural light through large floor-to-ceiling windows with sheer curtains. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), suggesting foreigner-friendly. For baby safety, the large windows on the 13th floor would need secure locks and guards; no visible balcony railings or stairs, which is a plus. The exposed gas pipes in the kitchen should be covered or secured once the baby becomes mobile."}
