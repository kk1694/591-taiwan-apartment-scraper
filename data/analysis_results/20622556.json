{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an, near Taipei 101", "notes": "High-end modern apartment on 12F with recessed lighting, glass-partitioned kitchen, sleek dark-tiled bathroom with glass shower enclosure, and dark hardwood flooring in bedroom with a stunning Taipei 101 view. The unit is unfurnished and in excellent, clean condition with built-in cabinetry and central AC. For baby safety, the glass kitchen partition has sharp edges to be mindful of, and the bathroom glass shower door has a metal rail threshold; the balcony appears to have slatted security grilles which is positive, and windows are fixed-pane style reducing fall risk. Excellent natural light from large windows; overall a premium, very clean unit well-suited for a family."}
