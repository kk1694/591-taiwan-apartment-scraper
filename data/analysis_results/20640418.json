{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near Taipei 101", "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean built-in wooden cabinetry, raised platform bed area with storage, split AC, video intercom, and a security door. The window view shows a central Xinyi District location with Taipei 101 visible nearby. The bathroom is clean with a glass-enclosed shower, though compact. For baby safety, the raised wooden platform has edges that could be a minor fall hazard for a crawling baby, and the glass shower door would need attention; otherwise no visible balcony railings or stairs to worry about. Good natural light from large windows on a mid-rise floor."}
