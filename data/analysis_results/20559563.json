{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment in Xinyi with stylish furnishings including Ligne Roset Togo sofas, Noguchi glass coffee table, wall-mounted TV, chandelier, and light wood-tone flooring. The glass coffee table with sharp edges is a baby safety concern and would need to be removed or padded; the large floor-to-ceiling windows appear well-curtained but balcony access should be verified for child safety. Good natural light from large windows, very clean condition overall; however only living room photos are shown — no bedroom, kitchen, or bathroom images, which is a red flag for a listing at this price point."}
