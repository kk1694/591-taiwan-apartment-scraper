{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with stylish fixtures including globe pendant lighting, leather sofa, large flat-screen TV, and open-plan living/dining/kitchen layout. The space appears clean, bright, and spacious at 29.2 ping. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need guards, and the TV stand is low and accessible to a crawling child. The 2nd floor location is manageable without an elevator. No visible balcony railings or stairs in this image. The listing description is minimal (just an ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — more photos and details should be requested."}
