{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with new fixtures, wood-tone flooring, and contemporary kitchen cabinets. Good natural light through large windows with frosted glass for privacy. The unit appears baby-safe with no visible balconies, stairs, or sharp corners; all floors are flat. The bathroom has a glass shower enclosure which would need supervision with a toddler. Being on 5F of an 11-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
