{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Very modern, new-construction apartment in excellent condition with recessed LED lighting, central AC, polished tile floors, glass-enclosed shower, and a built-in kitchen with oven. Multiple rooms have floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to balconies which are a baby safety concern and would need child locks; the balcony railings appear to have wide vertical gaps that should be checked. The apartment is spacious at 49 ping with good natural light, very clean, and essentially move-in ready, though mostly unfurnished aside from the living room sofa and some storage units."}
