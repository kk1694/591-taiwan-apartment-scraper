{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious modern apartment with high-end finishes, recessed lighting, open-concept living/dining/kitchen with sleek white cabinets and polished floors. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety: glass coffee table has sharp edges, balcony visible but appears enclosed; the glass shower partition in bathroom needs attention. Being on 11F of an 11-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Very clean and well-maintained."}
