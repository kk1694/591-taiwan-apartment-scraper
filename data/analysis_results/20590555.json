{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu", "notes": "High-end luxury apartment with designer finishes including herringbone dark wood flooring, stone accent walls, recessed lighting, freestanding soaking tub with dual vanity, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. Major baby safety concern: the bedroom is separated from the living/kitchen area by glass partitions rather than solid walls, and the open-plan layout with hard flooring and sharp-edged kitchen island could be hazardous for a crawling baby. The unit appears unfurnished aside from the bed and built-in fixtures, is very clean and in excellent condition, though the dark flooring and moody aesthetic feel more boutique-hotel than family-friendly."}
