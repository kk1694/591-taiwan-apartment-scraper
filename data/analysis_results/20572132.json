{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment on 17th floor with excellent natural light from multiple large windows. The unit features a spacious living room, built-in shelving, modern kitchen with gas stove, and a master bedroom. For baby safety, the balcony visible in images has floor-to-ceiling glass doors that appear secure, but the low coffee table has sharp corners worth noting. Overall clean and bright with quality finishes."}
