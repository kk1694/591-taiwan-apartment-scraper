{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex apartment with clean finishes, recessed lighting, and tile floors. Major baby safety concern: open internal staircase with metal railings leading to loft/mezzanine level would require baby gates. The apartment appears clean and well-maintained with good artificial lighting, though natural light is limited in the photos. Kitchen is compact but functional with refrigerator, microwave, and washing machine."}
