{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older Da'an district building (likely 1990s) with brown tile exterior, but the unit has been partially refreshed with clean tile flooring, wall-mounted AC, and an intercom system. The kitchen is dated with aging cabinets and a basic gas stove setup. The building has an elevator (confirmed in photo showing elevator lobby on floor 14). Windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, but the unit is unfurnished and on the 2nd floor which may get less natural light; the drop ceiling with fluorescent panels gives it a slightly commercial feel. At 32 ping for NT$45,000 in Da'an it is spacious and reasonably priced, but expect to invest in furnishing and some updates."}
