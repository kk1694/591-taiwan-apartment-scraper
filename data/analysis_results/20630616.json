{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern studio apartment with upscale finishes including crystal chandeliers, built-in furniture, and glass-enclosed bathroom. The space is clean and well-maintained with good lighting. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners, the open kitchen has accessible gas stove and appliances, and the small refrigerator/microwave closet could be a pinch hazard. The unit appears to be on the 9th floor of an 18-story building, strongly suggesting elevator access. Limited floor space at 11 ping may feel cramped with baby gear."}
