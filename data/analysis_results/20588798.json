{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment on high floor (14F/19F) with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. The unit features contemporary finishes, exposed ceiling pipes (industrial style), modern lighting, and appears well-maintained. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners, floor-to-ceiling windows access a balcony that would need childproofing, and the glass partition to the bedroom could be a concern. No stairs visible, single level layout is good for families."}
