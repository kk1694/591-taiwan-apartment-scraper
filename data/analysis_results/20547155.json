{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, newly renovated studio-style apartment with modern marble-look tile floors, new kitchen with stainless steel fridge, microwave, and built-in cabinets, plus a modern bathroom with glass shower partition. The balcony has decorative metal railings with gaps that could be a concern for a crawling baby — the geometric pattern has openings a small child could potentially reach through, and the balcony is on the 6th floor. The space gets decent natural light from the balcony-side windows; the open-plan layout with bed in the living area means limited separation for a growing family, but the 18.9 ping size is workable. Listed through a Japanese real estate agency (エイブル/Aiburu), suggesting foreigner-friendly management."}
