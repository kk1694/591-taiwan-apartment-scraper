{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with new grey wood-grain flooring, modern white kitchen cabinets, new split AC units, and updated black-frame windows throughout. The unit is unfurnished with multiple rooms and good natural light from large sliding doors and windows. For baby safety, the living room has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a balcony that would need child-proofing; the kitchen has a rear door with security grille. Being on 5F of a 7F older building, it likely has no elevator which is a concern for carrying a stroller and baby. At 44 ping this is spacious for the price in Zhongzheng district, and the clean renovation with no sharp corners visible makes it relatively baby-friendly, though the balcony access needs attention."}
