{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious modern apartment with elegant European-style finishes, crystal chandelier, LED-lit mirrors, and high-quality white tile flooring. The unit appears very clean with good natural light from large windows and a balcony with secure railings. For baby safety, the glass sliding doors have low thresholds but the sharp-cornered coffee table and glass surfaces may need childproofing; the open kitchen layout with accessible washing machine could also pose concerns for a crawling baby."}
