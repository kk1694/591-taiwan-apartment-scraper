{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with sleek finishes including recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, leather sofa, wall-mounted TV, modern kitchen with gas stove and ample counter space, and a clean bathroom with modern toilet. The 18-floor building on the 4th floor almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the sliding glass doors to the balcony area and the hard tile floors throughout are concerns; the coffee table has sharp metal corners, and the kitchen is a narrow galley style that a crawling baby could access. Good natural light from multiple windows in living room and bedroom, and overall the unit appears clean and in very good condition."}
