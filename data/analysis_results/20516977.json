{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently repainted unfurnished apartment with new tile flooring and wall-mounted AC units, but the building itself appears older (exposed wiring/pipes on walls, frosted glass entry door, older-style window bars). The unit is very spacious at 40 ping with multiple rooms visible down a hallway. For baby safety, the windows have metal security bars which is good, no balcony is visible, and the flat tile floors are easy to clean but slippery; the completely empty unfurnished state means you would need to furnish everything. Natural light appears limited as photos were taken at night and several windows have frosted/opaque glass facing what looks like a light well rather than outside. The listing description is essentially empty (just an ad for the agent's service package), which is a minor red flag."}
