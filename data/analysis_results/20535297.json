{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment in a modern 14-story building in Da'an district. The living room is very large with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and large black-framed windows providing good natural light; the bedroom has modern wood-laminate flooring and clean walls. The furniture is traditional Chinese style which may have sharp wooden corners on chairs and coffee table — a concern for a crawling baby. The building exterior looks well-kept with balcony railings visible; at 55 ping this is a generously sized unit suitable for a family, though only limited photos are available (no kitchen or bathroom shown) and the listing description is essentially just an agent ad with no real property details, which is a minor red flag."}
