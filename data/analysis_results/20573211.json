{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including recessed lighting, light wood-look flooring, and a clean minimalist aesthetic. The open layout with a spacious living/dining area, separate bedroom, and bathroom is quite baby-friendly — flat floors with no stairs, no visible balcony hazards, and rounded furniture edges on the coffee table and dining set. Natural light is moderate from the windows (2F facing trees), and the unit appears clean and move-in ready; the glass-doored bathroom and metal-frame coffee table legs are minor concerns to baby-proof later."}
