{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern loft-style apartment on 12th floor with excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows and balcony access. Clean white walls, wood flooring, and updated kitchen with modern appliances. For baby safety, the balcony railings appear adequately spaced but the loft area with glass partition to the lower level could be a concern; the space has minimal sharp corners and appears well-maintained."}
