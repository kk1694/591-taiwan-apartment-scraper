{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, light wood-tone flooring, and clean white walls throughout. The spacious open-plan living/dining area has good natural light from large windows; at least two bedrooms are visible (one master with large wardrobe, one smaller with single bed frame and built-in desk/shelving). For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is positive, but the dining table has sharp corners and the bed frames lack mattresses suggesting it may need furnishing; no balcony railings or hazardous edges are visible in photos. Listed through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency which specializes in foreign tenants, which is a good sign for English-speaking renters."}
