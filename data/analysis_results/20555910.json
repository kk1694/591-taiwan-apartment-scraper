{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Well-maintained older-style apartment with wooden furniture, clean white tile floors in living area and dark hardwood in bedroom. The glass display cabinet with open shelves and glass coffee table are baby safety concerns, as are the sharp corners on the wooden furniture. The bathroom has a bathtub which is convenient but the glass shelf above the sink poses a risk. Natural light appears decent from the curtained windows. The unit is managed by Dingli Rental Service and appears clean, but the decor and appliances (older CRT-style TV, dated bathroom tiles) suggest it was furnished some years ago. At 19 ping for ~47K/month in Zhongshan, pricing is on the higher side for the condition."}
