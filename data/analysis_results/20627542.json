{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Well-renovated industrial-chic apartment with modern kitchen (gas stove, range hood, black countertops), light wood flooring, high ceilings, and stylish pendant lighting. Listed by UR HOUSE, a foreigner-friendly rental agency. The open living-dining area is spacious with good natural light from large windows; at least two bedrooms are visible with built-in closets. For baby safety, the metal Tolix-style dining chairs have sharp edges, and the wooden venetian blinds have dangling cords that pose a strangulation risk; no balcony is visible in the photos. Overall very clean and move-in ready condition at a reasonable price for 29 ping in Songshan."}
