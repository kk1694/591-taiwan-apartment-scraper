{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Brand new, unfurnished modern apartment with high-end finishes including built-in kitchen with integrated fridge, induction cooktop, built-in oven, modern bathroom with smart toilet, glass shower enclosure, and washer. The unit appears very clean with recessed lighting and large format tile flooring. Baby safety concerns include the glass bathroom door leading from the main room, the small enclosed balcony with exposed pipes, and hard tile floors throughout; the glass partition between living area and bathroom would need childproofing. Being on 10F of a 15F building strongly suggests elevator access. At 14.7 ping this is a studio/1-room layout which may feel tight for a couple with a baby, and the listing appears to be an agent placeholder with minimal description."}
