{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin, near Yangmingshan", "notes": "Luxury modern apartment with polished marble-like striped flooring, designer curved walls, recessed lighting, and large floor-to-ceiling windows offering stunning mountain views toward Yangmingshan. The unit is spacious (46 ping), unfurnished, and very clean. Baby safety concerns include the highly polished slippery floors, large balcony with open metal railing structure visible in image 5, and the sliding glass doors leading to the balcony that would need child locks. Excellent natural light from multiple large windows on the mountain-facing side. The description is minimal (just a broker advertisement placeholder), which is a minor red flag — further details on layout, rooms, and amenities should be confirmed directly."}
