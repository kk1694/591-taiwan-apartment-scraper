{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern, hotel-style studio with high-end finishes including marble accent wall, LED ambient lighting, smart door panel, and wood paneling throughout. The bedroom features an elevated loft-style bed with storage underneath and a built-in desk, which is a significant baby safety concern as the raised bed has no guardrails and a child could easily fall. The space is clean and well-maintained but compact for a couple with a baby; being on the top floor (8F/8F) may mean heat issues and no penthouse buffer. Limited natural light with small windows. The glass coffee table with sharp metal edges is another baby hazard."}
