{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment in a newer high-rise building (12F/22F) with clean light wood flooring, recessed lighting, split AC, and a digital intercom/smart panel. The unit is spacious at 46 ping with at least 2 bedrooms (one could serve as a nursery), a dining area, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. For baby safety, the large windows appear to have fixed lower panels which is good, no visible balcony railings to worry about, and the flat single-level layout with no stairs is ideal; however, the glass-doored wooden cabinet in the living room and sharp-cornered coffee table would need baby-proofing. The description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder) which is a minor red flag — confirm actual room count and lease terms directly."}
