{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is clearly a commercial office space, not a residential apartment. It features drop ceiling tiles, fluorescent lighting, industrial carpet, and window-unit AC — all typical of an older Taiwanese office. One room shows a significant wall crack indicating possible structural concerns. Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby as it lacks any residential features (kitchen, bathroom not shown), and the description is just a generic agent advertisement with no real listing details."}
