{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated furnishings including worn burgundy leather sofas, old wooden TV cabinet, and a basic kitchenette with gas stove and aging cabinets. The space is reasonably clean with tile floors and appears to have a separate bedroom, living area, dining area, and bathroom. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners, the tile floor is hard, and the kitchen gas stove area lacks child-proofing; no balcony or stairway hazards are visible. Natural light appears limited with only small windows visible near the kitchen area."}
