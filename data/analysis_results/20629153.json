{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "御大德 (Yu Da De) building, Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment in a upscale 13-floor building with elevator (wheelchair accessible sign visible at entrance). Modern finishes throughout including polished tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in central AC, glass-partitioned kitchen with wood-tone cabinetry and gas stove. The 1F location is convenient for a stroller but natural light may be limited as windows appear small with curtains drawn. For baby safety, the hard tile floors are very slippery and all corners appear sharp-edged; the sliding glass kitchen partition is a plus for keeping a crawling baby out. Unfurnished unit listed through ULive Real Estate agent — the minimal description is a minor red flag suggesting this may be a generic agent listing."}
