{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed LED lighting, clean white tile floors, built-in cabinetry, and a sleek open kitchen with induction cooktop, microwave, washing machine, and large counter space. The living room is spacious with a comfortable sofa and ample built-in storage; the bedroom has central air conditioning and a hallway leading to what appears to be a bathroom. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery, the open kitchen cubby shelves and low TV unit have sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the window in the living room should be checked for child locks; no dangerous balcony railings are visible. Being on the 12th floor of a 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access, and the listing is through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency which caters to foreign tenants."}
