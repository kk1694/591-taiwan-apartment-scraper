{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment on the top floor (11F) with stylish curved ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, open-plan living/dining area, and a clean white kitchen with gas stove and full-size fridge. The glass coffee table has sharp edges and there is a raised step visible near the right side of the living room which are baby safety concerns; the balcony is accessible through floor-to-ceiling sliding doors and railing safety should be verified in person. Excellent natural light from large windows on multiple sides with mountain/city views, and the spacious 38.6 ping layout is very suitable for a growing family."}
