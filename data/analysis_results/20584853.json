{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end renovation with recessed lighting, marble accent walls, dark stone tile flooring in the entryway, and light wood laminate in the living areas and bedrooms. The apartment is unfurnished and in excellent, clean condition with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the large mirrored wall panels and hard stone/tile flooring in the entry area are concerns; the windows appear to have secure frames but blinds have accessible cords. At 46 ping this is a spacious unit suitable for a family, and the 6th floor location in Zhongshan is convenient, though elevator access is unconfirmed for a 7-story building."}
