Managed by UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a foreigner-friendly rental agency. The living room has a large window with natural light, the kitchen is spacious with a dining area for four, and the bedroom has a built-in desk area. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has rounded edges but the low TV shelf corners could be a concern; no visible balcony railings or stairs to worry about. At 27.72 ping on the 6th floor of a 10-story building, this is a spacious and well-maintained unit likely with elevator access, suitable for a growing family."}
