{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Clean, well-maintained unfurnished apartment with polished hardwood floors, recessed lighting, AC units, and an intercom system. The unit appears to be in a modern high-rise (6F/16F strongly suggests elevator access). There is a balcony with floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors which is a baby safety concern — the balcony railing and access should be checked in person. The apartment is spacious at ~28 ping with multiple rooms, good natural light from large windows with blinds, and clean white walls. No major red flags; being unfurnished allows full baby-proofing customization, but the hard wood floors may need area rugs for a crawling baby."}
