{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Four Seasons Plaza, Zhongshan District", "notes": "Upscale building with grand marble lobby, rooftop pool and lounge deck with city views. Building has multiple elevators. However, no interior photos of the actual apartment unit are shown - only common areas and amenities. Cannot assess baby safety, natural light, or unit condition. Red flag: listing appears to be a real estate agent advertisement rather than a genuine rental, and at 15.78 ping for NT$40,000 in a luxury building this seems overpriced without seeing the unit."}
