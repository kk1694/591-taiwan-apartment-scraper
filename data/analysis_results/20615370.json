{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with sleek kitchen, front-loading washer, glass-enclosed shower with black fixtures, and two bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and AC units. The space appears very clean and well-staged, though at 13 ping it will be tight for a growing family. Baby safety concerns include the glass shower enclosure with hard edges, low electrical outlets visible in the bedroom, and no visible window guards on the frosted bedroom window; no balcony or stairs are visible which is a plus."}
