{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "High-end modern building with luxury amenities including multiple elevators, an upscale lobby lounge with mailboxes, and an indoor swimming pool. The unit itself appears unfurnished with clean white walls, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and tile flooring at ~19 ping. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery and the unit is on 3F of an 18F building so balcony access should be checked; the empty unfurnished state means no sharp furniture corners but you will need to furnish it entirely. The building common areas are very well-maintained suggesting good management, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent promo) which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and actual interior photos."}
