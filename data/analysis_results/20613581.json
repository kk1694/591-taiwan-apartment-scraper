{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, light wood flooring, and contemporary fixtures including modern LED lighting and wall-mounted AC units. The space appears well-maintained and spacious at 36+ ping with multiple rooms. For baby safety: floors are smooth and easy to clean, corners appear mostly rounded, but no balcony railings visible to assess; the platform bed frame has hard edges that may need padding. Natural light appears limited based on the photos taken at night."}
