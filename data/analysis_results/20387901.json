{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in a luxury high-rise building in Zhongzheng district. The unit is unfurnished with pristine polished tile floors, recessed LED ceiling lighting, central air conditioning, and high-quality fixtures throughout. The building lobby features marble floors, digital notice board, and a well-maintained elevator — all indicating a newer, upscale development. For baby safety, the large windows have solid frames without low railings, and the flat open floor plan has no stairs or sharp architectural corners, though the highly polished tile floors could be slippery for a crawling toddler. Good natural light from large windows in multiple rooms with curtains already installed."}
