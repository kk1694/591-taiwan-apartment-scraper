{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with marble flooring, recessed lighting, and contemporary furnishings. Very clean condition with digital door lock and video intercom. For baby safety: the polished marble floors are slippery, there's a small balcony visible that would need securing, and some sharp-cornered furniture; however the open layout and good natural light from multiple large windows are positives. Appears to be a 2-bedroom unit on a high floor with city views."}
