{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including light wood flooring, recessed LED lighting with decorative ceiling panels, and clean white walls. The space is unfurnished and very clean with an open layout. For baby safety, the unit appears single-level with no visible stairs, but the open kitchen counter area may need childproofing; natural light seems limited to one window. No obvious red flags, but 3rd floor without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller."}
