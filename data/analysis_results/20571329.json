{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including new gray wood-look flooring, recessed LED lighting, built-in cabinetry, and split AC units. Very clean and spacious open layout with good natural light from large windows with security grilles. Baby safety is generally good with no visible stairs, though the open shelving in the kitchen area may need childproofing, and window security grilles provide extra safety."}
