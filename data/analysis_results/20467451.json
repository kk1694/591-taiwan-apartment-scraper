{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Stylishly renovated apartment with trendy industrial-modern design, wood-tone flooring, track lighting, open kitchen with glass backsplash and dining counter. The space is clean and well-furnished with a large TV, sofa, and decorative items. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, the open metal shelving unit could be a tipping hazard, and the kitchen is open-plan with no barrier to the gas stove area. Being on 1F is convenient for stroller access but natural light appears limited based on window sizes; the bedroom is quite compact with windows on two sides providing some light."}
