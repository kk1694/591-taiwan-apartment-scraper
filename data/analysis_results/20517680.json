{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Unfurnished apartment in clean but dated condition with older-style tile floors, track lighting in the living room, and a window-unit AC in the bedroom. The spacious 60-ping layout has a large open living area with sliding glass balcony doors and multiple bedrooms, offering decent natural light. For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors need child locks and the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from play mats; the unit is otherwise fairly open with no visible stairs or sharp built-in corners, but the completely empty/unfurnished state means significant setup cost."}
