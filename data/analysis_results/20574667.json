{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white walls, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and large sliding glass balcony doors providing good natural light. The living room appears spacious with a comfortable sofa and simple furnishings. At 10F/15F this is likely an elevator building; the balcony glass doors with low railings may need baby-proofing, and the coffee table has sharp corners that should be padded. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreign-friendly rental agency), which is a positive sign for expat tenants."}
