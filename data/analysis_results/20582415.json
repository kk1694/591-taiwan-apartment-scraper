{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Tao Zhu Yin Yuan (陶朱隱園) luxury tower, Xinyi District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated green tile finishes and narrow enclosed balcony areas. The balcony has security bars which adds safety for a baby, but the space is cramped with AC units and a washing machine. Limited interior photos shown - only balcony/utility areas visible. The street view shows proximity to the famous Tao Zhu Yin Yuan twisted tower, indicating a prime Xinyi location. Building appears to be a 5-floor walkup (3F/5F suggests no elevator typical for older low-rise buildings)."}
