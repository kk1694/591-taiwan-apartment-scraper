{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex-style apartment with high ceilings, clean white tile floors, contemporary furniture and built-in storage. Key baby safety concern: open staircase with widely-spaced railings would require a baby gate, and the balcony has vertical railings that appear reasonably safe but should be checked. Good natural light from large windows and balcony doors, very clean condition overall."}
