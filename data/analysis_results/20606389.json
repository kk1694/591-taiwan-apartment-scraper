{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment in a high-rise building (12F/22F) with updated laminate wood flooring, air conditioning, and recessed lighting throughout. The unit appears very clean with multiple bedrooms and an open layout. For baby safety, the space is mostly flat with no visible stairs; however, one bedroom has a small window positioned near floor level that may need childproofing. Good natural light in the main bedroom, though one secondary room has limited window space facing another building."}
