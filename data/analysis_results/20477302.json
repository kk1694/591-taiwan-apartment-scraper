{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated kitchen cabinets and yellowed ceiling tiles, though has newer laminate flooring. The unit is mostly unfurnished with a small bar counter area. Limited natural light visible in interior shots. For baby safety, the space is quite open but would need childproofing around the kitchen area and door thresholds. The building appears to be an older 4-story walk-up in a nice Da'an neighborhood with tree-lined streets."}
