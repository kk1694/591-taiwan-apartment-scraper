{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern open-plan apartment with contemporary finishes including wood flooring, built-in shelving, kitchen island with bar seating, and minimalist design. Good natural light from large windows with balcony access. For baby safety: the low coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but the bar stools and glass partitions near the kitchen could pose risks for a crawling/walking child; the balcony railings appear standard height but access should be monitored. Clean condition with no visible red flags."}
