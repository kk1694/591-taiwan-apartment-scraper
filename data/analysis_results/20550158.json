{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, Wuxing Street Lane 600, Daxin Xinyi Wenhua community, 5 min to Taipei 101, 139m to MRT station", "notes": "Brand new completion with modern furnishings, 2BR/1BA layout in a 13-floor elevator building. East-facing with natural light and mountain/green views, which is excellent. Has balcony (verify railing height/spacing for baby safety) and comes fully furnished. No pets allowed. Management fee of NT$2,477/month is additional cost. Good location in Xinyi near Taipei 101. Overall a solid option for a young family, though the single bathroom and relatively compact usable area (12.64 ping) may feel tight once baby arrives."}
