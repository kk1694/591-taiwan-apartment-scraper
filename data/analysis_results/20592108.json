{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment in Da'an with clean white tile floors, modern kitchen with gas stove and large refrigerator, wall-mounted AC units in multiple rooms, and a dedicated study/storage room with extensive built-in shelving and hardwood flooring. The glass coffee table with sharp corners and the sliding glass doors to the balcony area are minor baby safety concerns, but overall the flat layout with no stairs is good for a family. Natural light appears moderate through security-grilled windows; the 14-story building on floor 3 very likely has an elevator."}
