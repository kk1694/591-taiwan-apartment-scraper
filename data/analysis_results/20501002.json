{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a multi-level townhouse/duplex unit in good modern condition with recessed lighting, AC units, and clean tile floors. Major baby safety concern: the internal staircase has no visible safety gate or railings on the open side, which would require childproofing. The unit appears clean with decent natural light from large windows in the living room, though bedrooms have smaller windows."}
