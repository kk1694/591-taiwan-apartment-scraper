{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or newly renovated unfurnished unit with modern marble-look tile floors, split AC units, new kitchen with gas stove and range hood, and clean white walls throughout. The exposed conduit on the ceiling and completely empty rooms give it a slightly commercial/office feel, raising uncertainty about whether this is purely residential. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard and slippery, large windows have no visible child locks, but there are no stairs or dangerous balcony railings visible. Good natural light from large black-framed windows on multiple sides."}
