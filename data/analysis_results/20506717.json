{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment on the 1st floor of a 4-story walkup with new grey laminate flooring, recessed lighting, modern grey kitchen cabinets, and clean white walls. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at ~85 sqm with multiple rooms; being on the 1st floor is convenient for a family with a baby (no stairs to climb) but the window-unit ACs are older-style. The first image shows a nearby park/sports field with running track which is a nice amenity; baby safety looks good with no visible balcony or dangerous railings, though the large sliding glass doors in the living room would need childproofing once the baby is mobile."}
