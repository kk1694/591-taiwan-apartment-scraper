{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with hardwood floors, recessed lighting, and modern fixtures including split AC units and an open kitchen with full appliances. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners and the balcony has floor-to-ceiling windows but appears accessible; the glass dining table also has a rotating lazy susan that could be a concern. Excellent natural light from large windows with city views, clean condition overall."}
