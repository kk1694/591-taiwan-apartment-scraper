{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, new-construction apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, recessed LED lighting, split-unit AC in every room, and large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors in the living room providing abundant natural light. The unit is unfurnished except for one bedroom with a bed, and at 32.9 ping on the 10th floor of a 15-story building it almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling/walking toddler, and the balcony sliding doors would need child locks; however there are no visible stairs or sharp corners, and the overall space is spacious and clean with a flat single-level layout."}
