{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Unfurnished apartment in clean but dated condition with tile floors, basic stainless steel kitchen, wall-mounted AC units, and a long covered balcony/corridor. The unit is spacious at 41 ping but the kitchen is very basic and the overall finishes are older. For baby safety, the long open balcony corridor has low railings that would need childproofing, and the hard tile floors throughout could be a concern; natural light appears limited as windows face into a narrow alley between buildings. The description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag for a unit at NT$58,000/month."}
