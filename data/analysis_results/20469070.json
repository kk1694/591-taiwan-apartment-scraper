{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including polished black marble accent walls, light wood-grain laminate flooring in living areas, dark hardwood in bedroom, recessed LED lighting, wall-mounted AC, and built-in cabinetry. The space is very clean, spacious at 30 ping, and mostly unfurnished which is good for customizing. For baby safety, the glass-topped coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, the rolling office chair could be a hazard, and the kitchen appears to have an open layout without a gate — but overall the flat surfaces and lack of stairs are positive. Natural light comes through windows visible in the living room and bedroom; the 8th floor position should provide decent light and airflow."}
