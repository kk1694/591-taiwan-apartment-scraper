{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment in a 15-floor building (3F) with recessed lighting, central AC, glossy tile floors, white kitchen cabinets, LG fridge, induction cooktop, and a video intercom system. The open kitchen has a breakfast bar with tall swivel stools that are unstable and unsafe for a toddler; the balcony sliding doors and hard tile floors are also baby-safety concerns. The space is clean and bright with a spacious living area, though the kitchen is compact with a very small single-basin sink, and the listing description is mostly agent advertising with minimal detail about the actual unit."}
