{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious modern apartment with high-end finishes including polished marble floors, recessed lighting, decorative ceiling moldings, and premium wall paneling. The open-plan layout has a raised platform area with wood flooring and an open kitchen with glass partitions. For baby safety: the raised platform/step between living areas poses a tripping/falling hazard; the hard marble floors would benefit from area rugs; the glass kitchen partition has sharp edges. Good natural light from windows. Very clean and well-maintained condition."}
