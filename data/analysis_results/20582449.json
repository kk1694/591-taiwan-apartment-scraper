{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-furnished apartment in a high-end building with a grand lobby, concierge desk, and elevator (14-story building). The living room features contemporary finishes with light wood paneling, recessed lighting, a sofa, TV unit, and a small dining area. The building has organized trash/recycling and food waste rooms, indicating good management. Only the living room is shown so bedroom/kitchen/bathroom condition is unknown; the glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a baby safety concern, but overall the unit appears clean and well-maintained. Limited photos make it hard to assess natural light and full layout."}
