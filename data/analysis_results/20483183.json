{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with recessed LED ceiling lighting, marble-look flooring, white brick accent wall, and quality wood furnishings. The space is clean and spacious at 25 ping with a large living area, small kitchen, and a balcony visible through sliding glass doors. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) with no elevator info is a concern, and the balcony railing height should be verified for baby safety; the marble-like hard flooring could also be slippery for a crawling child. The listing is through HoYuan Real Estate Agency and the description is minimal (just a generic agent promo), which is a minor red flag for lack of detail."}
