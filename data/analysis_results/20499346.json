{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with updated white kitchen cabinets, LG refrigerator, induction cooktop, and breakfast bar with stools. Bathroom has modern tiles and fixtures with a glass-partitioned shower. Baby safety concerns: the loft bed in one room has a ladder and elevated sleeping area that would be dangerous for a toddler, and the bedroom window shows balcony railings with wide gaps that need childproofing. The 15-floor building on the 3rd floor almost certainly has an elevator. Natural light appears limited based on the window views."}
