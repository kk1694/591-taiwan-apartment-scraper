{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Very modern, newly built or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, decorative ceiling details, and central/concealed AC units. The unit on the 13th floor of a 14-story building (almost certainly has elevator) features a spacious living room with floor-to-ceiling sliding doors to a balcony with proper railings, plus at least two bedrooms with good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the balcony sliding door should be secured with a child lock, but otherwise the flat open layout with no stairs and smooth floors is very baby-friendly; the unit is completely empty/unfurnished so there are no sharp corners to worry about from existing furniture."}
