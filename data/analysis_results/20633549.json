{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious, recently renovated unfurnished apartment with clean white tile floors, modern AC units, recessed lighting, and an open kitchen with white cabinets and gas stove. The unit appears freshly painted with accent walls and is in excellent condition. The large windows with horizontal railing bars provide good natural light; the balcony railings appear adequate but loose cables on the floor and exposed electrical wiring near walls would need to be secured before a baby arrives. Being on 6F/7F with no elevator information is a concern for stroller access. Listed via HOYUAN Real Estate Agency, which specializes in foreign tenants."}
