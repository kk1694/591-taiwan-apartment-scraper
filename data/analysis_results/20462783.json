{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Very modern and clean apartment with minimalist white interior, new kitchen, AC, track lighting, and contemporary furniture. The balcony has a sliding glass door with low railing that could be a safety concern for a toddler; the glass coffee table has sharp metal corners worth baby-proofing. Good natural light from the balcony side, overall in excellent move-in condition with no visible red flags."}
