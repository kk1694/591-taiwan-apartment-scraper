{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern and stylishly renovated apartment with light wood finishes, recessed lighting, white brick accent wall, and black-framed glass partition doors. The flooring is laminate/wood-look and the space appears clean and well-maintained. Managed by UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a rental service catering to foreign tenants. Glass partition doors may need baby-proofing; no balcony or stairs visible in this image, and corners appear relatively smooth. Natural light comes through windows visible in the bedroom area. At 21.2 ping in Da'an on the 6th floor of 13, this is a decent-sized modern unit, though only one image limits full assessment of baby safety."}
