{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new, high-quality modern apartment in a recently constructed 9-story building with elevator. Interior features LED cove lighting, light wood laminate flooring, modern kitchen with gas stove, sleek cabinetry, and built-in entryway shoe cabinet with intercom. The living space is very clean with a balcony accessible through sliding glass doors; the balcony railings appear to have adequate height but would need baby-proofing for the glass door access. Good natural light from large windows. Excellent condition with no red flags — a very appealing unit for a family, though the 17 ping size may feel tight once baby gear is added."}
