{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Upscale, well-furnished apartment with crystal chandeliers, built-in cabinetry, glossy tile floors, and decorative wallpaper — clearly a high-end renovation. At 57.5 ping this is very spacious for a family. Baby safety concerns include the highly polished slippery tile floors throughout, glass-front display cabinets at low height, and sharp-cornered dark wood dining furniture; the balcony visible through curtains in image 1 should be checked for railing gaps. No bedrooms or kitchen shown in the photos, so full assessment is limited, but the living/dining areas are clean and in excellent condition with good ceiling-recessed lighting. The 8th floor of a 14-story building very likely has an elevator."}
