{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated studio-style apartment with stylish minimalist design featuring light wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, concrete accent wall, built-in cabinetry, open wardrobe area, wall-mounted TV, and a large refrigerator. The space is clean and well-maintained with rounded soft furniture, but as a large open-plan studio it lacks separate rooms for a nursery; natural light appears limited with only one window visible behind curtains. For baby safety, the low round coffee table and smooth furniture edges are positives, but the open clothing rail with metal bars and lack of room separation could be concerns as the child grows."}
