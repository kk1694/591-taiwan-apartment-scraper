{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older building in Da'an with partially renovated interior — new laminate flooring throughout but dated ceiling fixtures, old window-unit AC in one bedroom, and worn walls/ceiling with some discoloration. The kitchen has been updated with modern cabinetry, an island counter, and recessed lighting, which is a plus. The apartment is unfurnished and spacious at ~30 ping with multiple rooms. For baby safety, the windows appear to have security grilles which is good, but the window sills in the living area are low and accessible; no visible balcony railings or dangerous stairs. Natural light is moderate — windows face adjacent buildings closely, limiting direct sunlight especially in the smaller bedroom."}
