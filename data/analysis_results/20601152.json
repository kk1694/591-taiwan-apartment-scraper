{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Xinyi District, near Taipei 101", "notes": "This is NOT a residential apartment — it is a ground-floor commercial/garage space (車庫) with roller shutters, bare concrete floors, and industrial fluorescent lighting. The floor plan explicitly labels a large garage area. Interior rooms show severe water damage, mold stains on walls, peeling panels, and debris. The outdoor area has a deteriorating corrugated roof with exposed wiring. Completely unsuitable for a couple expecting a baby due to poor hygiene, no residential facilities, and numerous safety hazards. Located in an older low-rise building near Taipei 101 with a 'for rent' sign showing phone number 2378-0880."}
