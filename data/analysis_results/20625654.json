{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with custom built-in wooden cabinetry throughout, modern lighting fixtures, and split AC units in multiple rooms. The living room has a large L-shaped sofa, built-in TV wall unit, and clean tile flooring; bedrooms include built-in wardrobes and shelving. The glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the open wall shelves could be a climbing hazard for a toddler. Natural light appears limited based on photos with curtains drawn; the second bedroom is quite small with just a mattress on the floor, but could work as a nursery. The listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and amenities."}
