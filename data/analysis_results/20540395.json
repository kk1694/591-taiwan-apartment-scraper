{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older walk-up building (3F/4F) with dated 1980s-90s style interior including textured ceiling tiles, wooden furniture, and parquet flooring. The apartment is spacious and reasonably clean but shows signs of age with wall stains visible. For baby safety, the balcony has metal security bars which is good, but the many built-in cabinet corners and raised platform in bedrooms could be hazards. Natural light appears limited through security-barred windows."}
