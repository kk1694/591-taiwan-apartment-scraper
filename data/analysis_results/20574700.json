{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with new light wood laminate flooring throughout, freshly painted walls, modern recessed lighting, and clean condition. The space is unfurnished with multiple bedrooms featuring built-in wooden storage cabinets. Good natural light from windows with curtains. For baby safety: no visible balcony railings to check, single-level layout with no stairs visible, relatively minimal sharp corners on the built-in furniture. Being on floor 10 of a 27-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
