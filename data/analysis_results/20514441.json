{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very limited listing info - description is only a 591 platform ad, not an actual property description. Building is 21 floors (unit on 16F), strongly suggesting elevator access. At 12.68 ping (~42 sqm) for NT$45,000/month in Xinyi District, this is a modestly sized unit at a reasonable price for the area. No images or real description available to assess condition, baby safety features (balcony railings, sharp corners, stairs), or natural light - recommend visiting in person before deciding. The lack of a real description is a minor red flag suggesting a lazy or placeholder listing."}
