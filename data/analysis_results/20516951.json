{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, hotel-style studio apartment in excellent condition with clean minimalist design, recessed LED lighting, built-in cabinetry, vanity desk, central air conditioning, and a glass-enclosed bathroom with modern tiling. Listed by Elegant Realty (expat housing agent). Being on 6F/6F (top floor) with no visible elevator clues is a concern for a pregnant woman; the unit appears to be a compact studio which may feel tight for a couple with a baby. The glass bathroom door and floor-to-ceiling windows would need baby-proofing, but overall the space is very clean and well-maintained with no sharp corners or obvious hazards."}
