{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with traditional dark wood furniture (rosewood-style sofa set, bed frame, TV cabinet) and beige tile floors throughout. The bathrooms appear recently renovated with clean modern gray tiles and new fixtures, but the living areas feel dated. For baby safety, the traditional wooden furniture has many sharp carved corners and edges that would need padding; the window bars in the living room are a plus for child safety. Natural light appears limited based on the nighttime photos showing small windows. At 29 ping on the 3rd floor of a 7-story older building, it is spacious but the lack of visible elevator and the aged building style suggest it may be a walk-up. The listing description is essentially empty (just a generic agent ad), which is a red flag — very little information about the actual property."}
