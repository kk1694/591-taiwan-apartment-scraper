{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Large older-style apartment (51 ping) on 10th floor of a 14-story building with elevator, featuring dated dark wood furniture and cabinets, tile flooring in living areas and wood flooring in bedroom. The unit is clean but has aging fixtures and some wall discoloration near the bed headboard. For baby safety, the tile floors are slippery, the large glass display cabinet has sharp corners, and windows lack visible child-safety locks; however, the flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus. Natural light is moderate with small windows, and the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — more details on layout and amenities should be confirmed."}
