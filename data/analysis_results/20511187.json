{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with brand-new modern finishes throughout including light wood-tone laminate flooring, recessed lighting, modern pendant lights, marble-top dining table, and a fully updated kitchen with new white cabinetry and stainless steel sink. The space is very clean and appears move-in ready with furniture still in protective plastic wrapping. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is good, but the dining chairs have sharp metal legs and the kitchen has a door leading to what appears to be a rear balcony/laundry area that would need child-proofing. Natural light comes from windows in the living room area, though it appears moderate given the mid-floor position facing other buildings."}
