{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, recessed LED lighting with cove accents, modern roller blinds, split AC units, digital door lock, and built-in entryway shoe cabinet. At 40.7 ping this is very spacious; the 14-floor building on floor 5 almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery, windows have high sills with roller shutters which is good, and no visible balcony railings or stairs — overall a clean, safe blank canvas but will need furniture and baby-proofing. Note the listing description is mostly a broker ad placeholder with minimal detail, which is a minor red flag for transparency."}
