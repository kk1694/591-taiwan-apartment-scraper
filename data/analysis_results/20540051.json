{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment in Xinyi with double-height ceiling, stylish pendant lighting, clean white tile floors downstairs and hardwood upstairs, well-designed built-in storage in the staircase, and a walk-in closet area. Major baby safety concern: the steep open metal staircase leading to the mezzanine bedroom has wide gaps between railing bars and no risers, posing a serious fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler — a baby gate would be essential but difficult to install given the stair design. The low mezzanine ceiling height and loft layout may also be impractical with a stroller and baby gear."}
