{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Luxurious, well-maintained apartment with high-end finishes including marble floors, recessed lighting, modern white kitchen with island, and a spacious walk-in closet. The living room has a balcony with glass railings visible in image 1 which would need baby-proofing; the polished marble floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), this 53.72-ping unit on the 9th floor of a 12-story building almost certainly has an elevator, and the overall condition is excellent with abundant storage space."}
