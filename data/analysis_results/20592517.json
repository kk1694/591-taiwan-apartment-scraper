{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) with modern European-style finishes including recessed lighting, marble-look flooring, white built-in cabinetry, large flat-screen TV, crystal chandelier, and central air conditioning. The living room is spacious with large arched windows providing good natural light and what appears to be a balcony with glass doors. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp metal edges and the hard marble/tile flooring are concerns; the balcony access would need childproofing. The 9-story building on the 2nd floor almost certainly has an elevator, and the intercom/security panel by the entrance suggests a managed building with good security."}
