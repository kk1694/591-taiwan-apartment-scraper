{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with new light wood-grain flooring, fresh white walls, modern split AC units, and new doors throughout. The space is very clean and spacious with a large open living area, at least one bedroom, a separate kitchen, and bathroom. For baby safety: the balcony has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors with metal frames which is good, but the balcony railing height should be verified in person; no stairs visible (single-floor unit on 2F). Being on the 2nd floor of a 5-story walkup means no elevator, which could be challenging with a stroller and baby gear. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — request full details directly."}
