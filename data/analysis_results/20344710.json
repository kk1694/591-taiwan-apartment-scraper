{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment with clean polished tile floors and freshly painted white walls, but older-style fixtures including traditional chandeliers, dark wood trim, and wall-mounted AC units suggest a renovated but not modern unit. Windows have metal security grilles which are good for baby safety, and the balcony area appears enclosed; however the hard tile floors throughout and dark wood baseboards with sharp edges could be concerns for a crawling baby. The unit gets decent natural light from multiple windows but the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — no details on layout, kitchen, or bathroom condition."}
