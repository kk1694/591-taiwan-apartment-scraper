{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed lighting, split AC units, and updated kitchen with gas stove and range hood. The loft-style bedroom has low ceiling clearance which may feel cramped. Baby safety concerns include the elevated loft sleeping area (likely accessed by stairs/ladder not shown), and limited natural light in the windowless bedroom area. Overall very clean condition but the layout may not be ideal for a family with an infant."}
