{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed ceiling lighting, clean tile floors, and contemporary furniture. Good natural light from multiple large windows with security grilles. For baby safety: the coffee table has some sharp corners that may need padding, and the floor-to-ceiling windows should be checked for secure locks; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings in images. Overall clean and move-in ready condition."}
