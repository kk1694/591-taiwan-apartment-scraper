{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and well-renovated apartment with minimalist design, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC units, and clean light-colored finishes. The space appears clean and bright with good natural light from the balcony. Baby safety considerations: the balcony has secure metal railings visible from the bedroom, furniture has mostly rounded edges, but the glass partition near the dining area and exposed electrical outlets at low height may need childproofing. Being on 12F of a 12F building (top floor) is a concern if no elevator exists."}
