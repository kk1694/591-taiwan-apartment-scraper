{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious 32-ping apartment on the 3rd floor of a 4-story walkup building in Zhongzheng district, in fair but dated condition. The living room has large panoramic windows providing good natural light, recessed spotlights, AC units, and a leather sectional sofa, but the walls show some discoloration and aging; the kitchen is narrow galley-style with older fixtures, and the bedroom has dark wood built-in wardrobes and a desk. For baby safety, the large low windows in the living room are a concern as they lack protective bars or childproof barriers, the coffee table has sharp corners, and being a 3F walkup with no elevator would make stroller access difficult; the pet cage visible in the living room suggests previous pet owners."}
