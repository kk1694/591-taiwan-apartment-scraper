{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern white kitchen (gas stove, range hood, microwave, cabinets), split AC units in multiple rooms, built-in wooden wardrobe, and polished tile floors throughout. Very clean and baby-safe with no visible sharp corners, stairs, or hazardous balcony access; the sliding windows have secure frames. Good natural light from large windows in bedroom and living area. The unit is completely empty/unfurnished so all furniture would need to be provided; the description is minimal (just an agent promotion) which is a minor red flag — confirm layout details and whether bathroom photos are available."}
