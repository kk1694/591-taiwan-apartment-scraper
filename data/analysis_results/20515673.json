{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with extensive built-in wood cabinetry, raised tatami-style platform area, and clean white tile floors. The unit appears well-maintained with recessed lighting and split AC units. For baby safety, the raised platform with steps could be a concern for a crawling infant, but corners appear rounded and there are no visible balcony railings or major hazards in these interior shots."}
