{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious renovated apartment with hardwood floors, recessed lighting, split and window AC units, built-in cabinetry, and a nice entryway with shoe cabinet and frosted glass partition. The unit is unfurnished and clean with multiple rooms and decent natural light. For baby safety, the windows appear to have adequate railings visible in bedroom photos, but the floor step-up at the entryway and the open shelving unit with sharp corners in the study/living area would need childproofing; being on 6F of a 7-story building without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller and baby gear."}
