{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older, unfurnished 2-story space with commercial/office-like drop ceiling tiles and fluorescent lighting, raising questions about whether it is truly a residential apartment or a converted commercial space. Major baby safety concerns: an open staircase with very low concrete half-walls (no railing or gate), steep concrete stairs between floors, and no visible baby-proofing potential. The kitchen is dated with basic gas stove and old tile flooring; very limited natural light throughout as windows are small and frosted. Overall the space feels like a bare, aging office or shop conversion rather than a comfortable family home."}
