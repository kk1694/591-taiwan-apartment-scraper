The unit is unfurnished with excellent natural light from large balcony doors. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors with railings visible; would need baby gates for balcony access. No stairs inside, flat layout is good for a young family. Built-in storage cabinets in bedroom."}
