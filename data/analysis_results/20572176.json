{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment with high-end finishes including polished tile floors, built-in kitchen appliances, glass-enclosed bathroom with bathtub, and split AC units. For baby safety, the balcony has decorative iron railings that are reasonably safe but should be monitored; the unit is unfurnished with no sharp corners and the space is very open. Good natural light from large windows on 14th floor with city views; extremely clean condition suggesting new or recently renovated."}
