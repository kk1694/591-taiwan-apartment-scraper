{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wenshan District, Mucha Road Section 3, near Wenshan Administration Center MRT and Mucha MRT (186m)", "notes": "Large 4BR/2BA unit on 20F/29F with elevator, two balconies, fully furnished with major appliances. Very family-friendly: permits cooking and pets, near MRT, schools, and shopping. Two balconies require checking railing height/gaps for baby safety; high floor is great for light and air but balcony access should be secured. Management fee of NT$5,300/month adds to total cost. No photos could be verified for condition/modernity, so marking is_modern as unknown."}
