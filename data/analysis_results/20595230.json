{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with premium finishes including marble walls, wood paneling, recessed lighting, and polished tile floors. Very clean condition with good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety: the raised tatami-style platform beds near windows require attention, and the slick tile floors in the living area could be slippery; balcony has standard railings visible. Overall excellent condition with no major red flags."}
