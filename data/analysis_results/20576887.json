{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious, modern unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC units in multiple rooms, and large windows providing abundant natural light. The unit is on 5F of an 11-story building (very likely has elevator), with a hallway leading to multiple rooms suggesting a multi-bedroom layout ideal for a family. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery; no balcony railings or stairs are visible in the photos, and windows appear to be fixed-pane or have limited openings which is a positive safety feature. Note this is listed as an agent/broker listing and is completely empty — you will need to furnish it entirely."}
