{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Recently repainted empty space with new vinyl flooring but an older building structure (exposed concrete ceiling, window bars, older-style bathroom with cramped layout under stairs and basic HCG water heater). The bathroom is very small with a sloped ceiling and no separation between wet/dry areas, posing slip hazards for a family with a baby. The unit is completely unfurnished with no kitchen visible, the laundry area looks rough with exposed plumbing, and the 2F walkup in a 4-story building likely has no elevator — the overall feel is more like a converted commercial or mixed-use space rather than a standard residential apartment, which is a red flag for livability with an infant."}
