{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Clean, modern apartment in excellent condition with white tile floors, wall-mounted AC, modern light fixtures, L-shaped sofa, dining set, and matching wood-tone furniture throughout. The living room has good natural light from large windows, and at 27.85 ping with at least 2 bedrooms it offers adequate space for a family. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery, and the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding; no dangerous balcony access or stairs are visible. Listed through a Japanese/Chinese housing rental agency (聯勝房屋), suggesting it may be foreigner-friendly."}
