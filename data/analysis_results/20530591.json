{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with custom built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, and high-quality finishes throughout. The space appears very clean with smooth tile floors and rounded furniture edges that are relatively baby-friendly, though the glass display cabinet and small decorative items on shelves would need childproofing. Natural light appears limited based on heavy curtains, but artificial lighting is excellent; at 5F/13F this building almost certainly has an elevator."}
