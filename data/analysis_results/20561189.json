{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Highly modern luxury apartment with designer finishes including marble walls, recessed lighting, and high-end furniture. The building is a newer high-rise (12th of 13 floors) which certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the open floor plan is good but the marble flooring could be slippery and the sharp-edged modern furniture and low coffee table corners may need padding; there's a balcony visible that would need secure railings verification. Excellent natural light from large windows, very clean and well-maintained condition."}
