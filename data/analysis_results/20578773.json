{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "This listing appears to be a residential apartment in Da'an District at 13 ping (42.9 sqm) on the 8th floor of an 8-floor building. The description is minimal (appears to be a broker ad template rather than a real property description), which is a red flag - the lack of detail about the unit makes it difficult to assess condition, layout, or baby safety features. Being on the top floor (8F/8F) may mean no elevator and potential roof leak issues; the price of NT$50,000 for 13 ping in Da'an seems reasonable but the sparse listing warrants caution."}
