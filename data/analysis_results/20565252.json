{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean white walls, contemporary furniture, and stylish light fixtures. The space is bright with good natural light through sheer curtains. For baby safety, the furniture has relatively rounded edges and the floor is smooth tile which is easy to clean; no visible balcony railings or stairs to worry about, but the low coffee table edges should be padded when baby becomes mobile."}
