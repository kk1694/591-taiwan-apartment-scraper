{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency with Japanese service). Features hardwood floors throughout, recessed lighting, a large L-shaped sofa in the living room, glass sliding partition doors between living and bedroom areas, multiple rooms including at least 3 bedrooms, built-in closets and desks. The sliding glass partitions between rooms could be a baby safety concern as a crawling child could bump into them; one room has a balcony-facing sliding door at floor level which would need child-proofing. Good natural light from large windows on a high floor (8F), clean condition overall with no visible damage or red flags."}
