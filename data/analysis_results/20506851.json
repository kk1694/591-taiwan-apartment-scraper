{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with new grey wood-look flooring, freshly painted walls, and a modern bathroom with glass-enclosed shower. The living area is spacious with large sliding doors providing good natural light, and the unit is unfurnished. Being on 1F of a 5-floor walkup (no elevator) is convenient for a couple with a baby—no stairs needed. However, the bathroom has a glass shower enclosure with sharp metal edges at floor level that could be a concern for a crawling baby, and the back utility/kitchen area with exposed gas meter and pipes looks dated. The tree-lined street outside appears quiet and pleasant."}
