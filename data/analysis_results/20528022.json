{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, newly renovated apartment with modern minimalist furnishings, marble-style tile flooring, modern bathroom with glass shower enclosure, and Sakura water heater on the balcony. The balcony has metal railings with relatively wide spacing which is a baby safety concern; the glass shower door edges and hard tile floors are also risks for a crawling baby. Natural light appears limited based on the photos with curtains drawn, but the unit is bright with recessive lighting and overall in excellent move-in condition."}
