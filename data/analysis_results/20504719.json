{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/industrial space rather than a residential apartment - it has bare concrete floors with visible wear and staining, fluorescent tube lighting, a simple intercom system, and minimal kitchen cabinets typical of an office or workshop setup. The space is completely unfurnished with a warehouse-like feel. For a couple expecting a baby, the hard concrete floors pose safety concerns for a crawling infant, and the space would require substantial renovation to make it livable as a home. The 4-story building on 2F likely has no elevator."}
