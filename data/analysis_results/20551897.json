{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Brand new or nearly new unfurnished apartment in a modern high-rise (11F/27F) with clean white walls, polished tile flooring in living areas, and wood-look flooring in bedrooms. The unit is very clean with modern split AC units, large windows providing good natural light and mountain/city views. For baby safety: the unit is completely flat with no stairs, no visible balcony access, and windows appear to have secure framing; however the hard tile floors in the living area would benefit from soft mats, and the exposed ceiling pipes/conduits are a minor aesthetic concern but not a safety issue. The space is spacious at 52.8 ping and appears to have multiple rooms suitable for a growing family, though it will need to be fully furnished."}
