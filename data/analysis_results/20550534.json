{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near MRT Xiangshan Station", "notes": "Traditional/dated interior with stone accent wall, crystal chandelier, and calligraphy scrolls. Floor plan shows 2 bedrooms, spacious living area with large outdoor terrace/balcony. For baby safety: the large balcony area would need childproofing; hard granite table and stone fireplace feature have sharp corners. The dated aesthetic and ornate styling may not appeal to those seeking modern finishes, though the space is clean and well-maintained."}
