{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment in a newer building with recessed LED lighting, clean tile floors, and AC. The unit appears freshly renovated but completely unfurnished with only a low wooden shelf/TV stand; images 3-4 show upscale building common areas (meeting room, lounge) suggesting a well-managed residential complex. For baby safety, the bare tile floors are slippery and the unit lacks visible window guards, though the 8th-floor height in an 18-story building confirms elevator access; the description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder) which is a minor red flag — further details on layout and actual rooms should be confirmed in person."}
