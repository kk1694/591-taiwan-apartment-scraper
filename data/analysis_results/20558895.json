{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious and upscale apartment on the 15th floor of an 18-story building with premium hardwood flooring throughout, recessed LED lighting with cove accents, and a decorative stone feature wall. The unit has excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows in multiple rooms with city views; the flat layout with no visible stairs is baby-friendly, though the large windows/possible balcony access would need child-proofing. The apartment appears mostly unfurnished and in very clean, well-maintained condition with high-end finishes befitting the Xinyi district location, but the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — would need to confirm layout details, kitchen, and bathroom condition in person."}
