{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, spacious apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, and contemporary furniture. The open layout with large windows provides good natural light. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need protection, and the balcony areas visible through floor-to-ceiling windows should be checked for secure railings. No visible stairs or major hazards; the flat, single-level layout is stroller-friendly."}
