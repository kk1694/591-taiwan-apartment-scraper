{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Dated 1990s-style interior with extensive wood paneling, decorative ceiling lighting, and older fixtures throughout. The apartment is spacious but shows its age with worn parquet flooring and some visible floor stains/debris in the bedroom. For baby safety, the hardwood floors are reasonable but the treadmill in the living area and various sharp furniture corners would need attention. Being on the 7th of 7 floors (top floor) in an older building raises questions about elevator availability."}
