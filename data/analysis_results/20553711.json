{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment with high-end finishes including wood paneling, recessed lighting, marble dining table, and modern furniture. Very clean and well-maintained with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp edges and display cabinet with glass doors containing breakable items are concerns; no visible balcony or stairs in images. The 9th floor in a 14-floor building strongly suggests elevator access."}
