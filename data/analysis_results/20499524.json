{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Spacious, modern luxury apartment with recessed LED ceiling lighting, large-format tile flooring, leather sectional sofa, and a massive TV wall feature. The unit is very clean and well-maintained with high-end finishes throughout. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows in both the living room and bedroom should be checked for child locks; the hard tile floors throughout may also need soft mats. The apartment gets decent natural light from multiple windows, and the listing is managed by Hoyuan Real Estate Agency which specializes in expat rentals, suggesting foreigner-friendly terms. Listed via an agent promotion rather than a detailed description, so the actual layout (number of bedrooms/bathrooms) should be confirmed directly."}
