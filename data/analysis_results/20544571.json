{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is a multi-level unit (duplex/maisonette) in an older 4-story walk-up building with internal stairs and a mezzanine loft with wooden balustrade railing. Major baby safety concern: the internal staircase has steep, worn stone steps and the mezzanine railing spindles may have gaps wide enough for a child to slip through, requiring baby gates at multiple points. The enclosed balcony area shows aging tile and some discoloration; the living areas have nice herringbone flooring and a crystal chandelier suggesting partial renovation, but overall the building is dated with window security bars and no elevator, making stroller access difficult on the 2nd floor."}
