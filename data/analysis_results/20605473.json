{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Modern, newly built apartment on 12F/15F with clean white walls, polished tile floors, recessed LED lighting, and wall-mounted AC. The unit is unfurnished with multiple rooms visible down a hallway (likely 3 bedrooms), making it spacious at 24.5 ping. For baby safety, the balcony has sturdy metal railings visible through the living room window, and the flat single-level layout with no stairs is ideal; however, the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from soft mats. The high floor provides good natural light and an open city view, and the building almost certainly has an elevator given it is a modern 15-story structure."}
