{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Beitou Thermal Valley river area", "notes": "High-end modern apartment with designer interior, recessed lighting, quality wood flooring, and upscale furniture. Very spacious at 47.84 ping with multiple rooms. For baby safety: the round coffee table has smooth edges which is good, but the raised platform/tatami area in one room could be a fall hazard for crawling babies. Located near a scenic riverside park, which is excellent for family walks. Building on 7th floor of 10-story building likely has elevator."}
