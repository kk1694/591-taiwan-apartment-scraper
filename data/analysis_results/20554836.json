{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment in clean condition with hardwood floors and built-in wooden cabinetry, but the fixtures and style are dated (1990s-2000s era). Good natural light from large windows with security grilles. For baby safety, the low platform beds have sharp corners that would need padding, and window grilles appear secure. No visible balcony hazards or stairs in images."}
