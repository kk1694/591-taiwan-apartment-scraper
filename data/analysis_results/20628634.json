{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern furnishings, light wood flooring, and good natural light from large windows. The space appears clean with at least 2 bedrooms and an open living/dining area. The glass coffee table and glass cabinet panels pose minor baby safety concerns, but overall the flat layout with no visible stairs is suitable for a family with a baby."}
