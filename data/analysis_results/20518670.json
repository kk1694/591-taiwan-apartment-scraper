{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Lavishly decorated apartment with European-style ornate crown molding, padded wall panels, crystal chandelier, and mirrored surfaces throughout. At least two bedrooms plus a study/third room with built-in wardrobes and desk; the living area has a white leather sofa and marble side table. Baby safety concerns include floor-to-ceiling balcony doors in the bedrooms with accessible railings visible outside, large mirror panels that could shatter, and smooth tile floors that are slippery. The building is on the 7th of 14 floors, strongly suggesting elevator access; natural light appears moderate with balcony access in bedrooms, though the ornate style may feel overly busy and the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag."}
