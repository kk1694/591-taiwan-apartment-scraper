{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Muzha (木柵), near Muzha Post Office", "notes": "Older unfurnished apartment with dated ceiling fans, tile floors, and yellowing walls showing its age. The building has a walk-up staircase visible in image 3 with no elevator, which is a major concern at 9F for a pregnant woman. The balcony has metal security grilles which are good for baby safety, but the 9th floor walk-up without elevator is a serious red flag. The unit is spacious at 63 ping with decent natural light, comes with underground parking (spot 155), and is located near Muzha center with a post office and Sinyi Realty nearby."}
