{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with modern recessed lighting, polished stone floors, and quality wood cabinetry throughout. The living room is large with good natural light from multiple windows, and the dining area features a round table with an ornate chandelier. For baby safety, the polished stone floors are very hard and slippery which is a concern for a crawling/toddling baby; the glass coffee table has sharp corners, and several framed paintings are leaning against walls at floor level which could topple. At 2F in a 4-story building this is likely a walk-up without elevator, which would be difficult with a stroller and baby gear."}
