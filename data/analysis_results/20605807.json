{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated green marble flooring, old-style window AC units, and walls showing wear marks. The balcony has traditional low railings which pose a safety concern for a baby/toddler. Good natural light from multiple large windows and balcony access, but the unit is unfurnished and shows its age - being on the 7th floor of a 7-floor building without visible elevator evidence is a concern."}
