{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed lighting, sleek dark stone-tile flooring in the living area, light wood flooring in the bedroom, brand-new white kitchen with gas stove and range hood, and clean white walls throughout. The space is very spacious at 62 ping and unfurnished, with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, note the balcony visible outside the living room windows has metal railings that appear adequately spaced, but the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom with venetian blinds open to a balcony on the 6th floor and should be secured; the hard stone tile in the living area could be a concern for a crawling baby and may need soft mats. Listed through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency, a firm that specializes in foreign tenants, which is a positive sign for a foreign couple."}
