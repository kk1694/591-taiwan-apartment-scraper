{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with clean minimalist design, wood-panel accents, recessed lighting, and quality fixtures including split AC units. The open-plan layout has smooth wood flooring with no stairs visible and rounded furniture edges making it relatively baby-safe, though the low windows may need childproofing. Natural light appears limited with small windows, but the space is well-lit artificially and immaculately clean."}
