{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Da'an Forest Park", "notes": "Spacious upscale unfurnished apartment on 10F with polished hardwood floors, recessed LED lighting, ornate ceiling fixtures, and built-in wooden wardrobes with en-suite bathroom. The view overlooks what appears to be Da'an Forest Park with an elevated MRT line visible, suggesting excellent location. For baby safety: the unit is completely empty with no sharp corners from furniture, but the hardwood floors are very slick and could be slippery; windows appear small and high which is good for child safety; the black marble entryway floor could be slippery. Some wall marks and a removed TV mount suggest previous wear but overall the unit is in good condition with generous natural light."}
