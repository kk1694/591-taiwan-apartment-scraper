{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean finishes, recessed lighting, split AC units, and contemporary furniture. The floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light but the bedroom window has a small balcony area with a low railing that would need baby-proofing. Coffee table has sharp corners; overall the space is clean and well-maintained with minimal clutter."}
