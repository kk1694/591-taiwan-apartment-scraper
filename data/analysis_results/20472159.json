{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with high-quality finishes including recessed lighting, central AC, and polished tile/hardwood flooring. The balcony has proper vertical railings which are relatively baby-safe, though the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need childproofing. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows in both living room and bedrooms. Spacious layout at 49 ping with at least 2 bedrooms visible, suitable for a growing family."}
