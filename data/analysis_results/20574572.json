{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and clean apartment with freshly painted white walls, recessed lighting, split AC units in every room, and polished tile floors throughout. At least two bedrooms plus a large living area with multiple windows providing decent natural light. The bathroom has a bathtub which is a baby-safety concern (drowning risk) and the smooth tile floors could be slippery; the 4th floor without confirmed elevator access would be inconvenient with a stroller. Overall the unit is in good condition but sparsely furnished with basic furniture; no visible balcony railings or sharp corner hazards in the photos."}
