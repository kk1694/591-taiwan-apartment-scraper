{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with contemporary furnishings including grey sofas, modern kitchen with built-in appliances, and split AC units. The space is very clean with good natural light through large windows. For baby safety, the furniture has relatively rounded edges and the flat single-level layout is suitable, though the large windows/balcony doors would need childproofing once the baby becomes mobile."}
