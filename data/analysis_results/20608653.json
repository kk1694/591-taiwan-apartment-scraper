{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older high-rise residential building (likely 1990s era) with community amenities including recreation room with billiards and ping pong, a lobby/common area, and a courtyard garden. No interior apartment photos were provided - only building exterior and common areas are shown. The building appears well-maintained but dated, and the tall high-rise would definitely have an elevator. Cannot assess apartment condition, baby safety features, or natural light without interior photos."}
