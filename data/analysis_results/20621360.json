{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Discovery Hill (碧湖山莊), Wenshan District", "notes": "This is a premium high-rise complex (Discovery Hill) with luxury amenities including an indoor swimming pool, escalators in the lobby, and well-maintained landscaped grounds. The interior shown is modern with clean wood-look flooring, built-in cabinetry, and ceiling-mounted central AC. For baby safety, the pool area is a concern and the building's escalators near the entrance could be hazardous for toddlers; however, the unit interior appears clean and flat with no visible stairs or sharp edges. No interior photos of bedrooms or balconies were provided, so natural light and balcony railing safety cannot be fully assessed — request more unit photos before committing."}
