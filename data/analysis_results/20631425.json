{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment (39 ping) with dated decor including dark wooden beam ceiling accents and older-style window AC units. The space is very clean with polished tile floors and ample built-in white cabinetry, but the overall aesthetic is from the 1990s-2000s era. The unit appears to have multiple rooms with grid-pattern glass partition walls, a visible bathroom, and a balcony with security grilles. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout would need rugs or mats, and the open shelving units have sharp corners at child height; the balcony has metal security grilles which is positive. Being on 2F of a 7F building with no visible elevator, carrying a stroller up stairs could be an issue."}
