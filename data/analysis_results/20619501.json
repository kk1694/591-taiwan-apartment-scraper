{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern studio-style apartment with contemporary design featuring exposed brick accent wall, wooden ceiling details, and dark hardwood floors. The space is clean and well-maintained with modern AC units and furnishings. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is good, but the low coffee table has sharp corners and the iron pipes used as decorative elements could be hazardous; natural light appears limited with small windows behind vertical blinds."}
