Excellent natural light with floor-to-ceiling windows and panoramic city/mountain views. Baby safety concerns: large wrap-around balcony with metal railings has wide gaps between bars that would require childproofing; highly polished slippery floors throughout. Overall immaculate condition in an upscale hillside building."}
