{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated luxury apartment with high-end finishes including LED cove lighting, modern open kitchen with built-in appliances, marble-top island, and spacious bedroom with walk-in closet area. The flat layout with no visible stairs is excellent for baby safety; smooth rounded archways and minimal sharp corners are positives. Natural light appears moderate from windows visible in image 3, though some rooms rely on artificial lighting. Managed by UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly rental service), which is a good sign for a foreign couple. At 31.46 ping this is very spacious and immaculately clean, though the 3rd floor without confirmed elevator could be inconvenient with a stroller."}
