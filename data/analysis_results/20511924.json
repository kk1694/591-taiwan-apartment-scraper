{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious 59-ping apartment listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent). The unit is clean but dated with older-style wooden furniture, traditional dining set, and conventional light fixtures; the kitchen has been updated with modern cabinetry and a gas stove. Good natural light in the living room and bedroom with large windows; floors are smooth tile throughout which is easy to clean but slippery for a crawling baby. No obvious balcony railing hazards visible, but the glass coffee table with sharp corners in the living room and the open shelving units would need baby-proofing. At 3F with no elevator confirmed, carrying a stroller up stairs could be a concern."}
