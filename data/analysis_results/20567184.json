{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Dongmen (東門旅店 visible)", "notes": "Older building with dated interior including drop ceiling tiles and basic laminate flooring. Has internal staircase connecting floors which is a major baby safety concern - stairs lack gates and have low walls. Rooftop terrace has low railings and stained concrete. Multiple windows provide decent natural light but overall feels office-like rather than homey. The space is clean but basic with minimal furnishing."}
