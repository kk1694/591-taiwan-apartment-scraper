{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Older but well-maintained apartment with light wood laminate flooring and clean white walls. The unit is spacious at 51 ping with multiple rooms, a separate kitchen with tiled walls and decent cabinetry, and a narrow enclosed balcony suitable for laundry. One bedroom has a window-mounted AC unit suggesting an older building, while the living room has a wall-mounted split AC. For baby safety, the balcony has a solid half-wall railing which is reasonable, but the balcony is narrow and has exposed pipes; the flat layout with no stairs is good. Natural light is moderate with windows in multiple rooms, though some face close neighboring buildings. The unit is unfurnished and clean but the fixtures (lighting, AC, intercom) appear dated — functional but not modern. Being on 6F of a 7F building with no visible elevator clues, this may be a walk-up which would be very challenging with a stroller and baby."}
