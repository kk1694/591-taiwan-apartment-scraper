{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a 3-bedroom apartment with moderately dated finishes - walls show wear marks and scuffs, furniture is basic/older style. The unit appears cluttered with belongings. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp edges is a concern, and one bedroom shows a bed directly on the floor which could be adapted. Natural light is limited in most rooms with small windows, though the living room gets some daylight."}
