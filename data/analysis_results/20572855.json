{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with white tile floors, split AC units in multiple rooms, and contemporary furnishings. The bedroom appears small with only a single bed, which may be tight for a couple with a baby. The balcony access is visible through curtains but railings are not shown; natural light seems limited as rooms appear mostly artificially lit. Overall very clean condition with rounded furniture edges, though the bedroom size is a concern for a growing family."}
