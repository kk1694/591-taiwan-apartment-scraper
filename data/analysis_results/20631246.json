{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older Taiwan apartment with basic finishes - vinyl flooring, exposed conduit pipes on ceiling, and dated kitchen cabinets. The space is clean and spacious at 42 ping. Baby safety concerns include the balcony with standard railings that would need baby gates, and the rear utility area has window bars and worn condition. Natural light appears moderate from balcony doors; overall functional but dated condition."}
