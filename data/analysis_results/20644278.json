{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with LED cove lighting, contemporary furniture, and clean finishes throughout. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. For baby safety, the balcony doors need attention as they open fully to an outdoor space on the 6th floor, and the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. Overall very clean condition with multiple bedrooms and en-suite bathroom visible."}
