{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious 46-ping apartment in a 17-story building (8F) with older but well-maintained furnishings including hardwood floors, leather sofas, built-in wooden wardrobes, and a piano. The decor is dated (likely 15-20 years old) with traditional fixtures, but the unit is clean and livable. For baby safety: the living room has a glass-topped coffee table with sharp corners, the bathroom has a bathtub and hard tile floors that could be slippery, and the balcony visible through sliding doors would need childproofing; the bathroom notably has accessibility grab bars which is unusual. Good natural light from multiple windows in both the living room and bedroom, and the generous size provides plenty of room for a growing family."}
