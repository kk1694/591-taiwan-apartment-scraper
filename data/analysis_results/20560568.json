{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with high-end finishes including dark marble-look tile flooring, recessed LED lighting, built-in TV console, and sleek curtains. The unit is spacious at 65 ping with multiple rooms visible including a kitchen area and modern bathroom with glass door. For baby safety, the dark polished stone floors may be slippery and hard on falls — area rugs recommended; balcony access visible through floor-to-ceiling windows needs childproofing; large mirrored wardrobe doors in the bedroom could be a shatter risk. The apartment is unfurnished, very clean, and appears move-in ready with good natural light from large windows. Being on the 6th of 7 floors in Zhongshan is a desirable location, though the listing description is minimal (agent promotional text only), which is a minor red flag — request full details directly."}
