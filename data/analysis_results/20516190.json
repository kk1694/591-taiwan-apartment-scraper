{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean finishes, light wood flooring, marble accent walls, and modern kitchen with built-in range hood. The unit appears to have at least 3 bedrooms (master with balcony access via large sliding glass doors, a second bedroom, and a smaller third room). For baby safety, the large sliding glass doors to the balcony on the 2nd floor need child locks, and the balcony railing height should be verified in person. The apartment is bright and clean, managed by UR HOUSE rental agency; at 25 ping with multiple rooms, it offers good space for a growing family, though the kitchen is compact."}
