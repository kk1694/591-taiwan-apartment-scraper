{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, brand-new studio apartment with high-end finishes including built-in concealed AC, smart home panel (security, intercom, smart home controls), digital door lock, built-in oven/microwave, and in-unit washer. However, at only 9 ping this is a compact open-plan studio with bed, sofa, and kitchen all in one room — very tight for a couple with a baby. The balcony area visible through the glass door has railings but the space is extremely limited for baby gear like a crib or stroller storage. No sharp corners are a concern as furniture is minimal and rounded, but the lack of a separate bedroom or any room division is a significant drawback for a growing family."}
