{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with high-quality wood flooring, custom built-in cabinetry, and contemporary fixtures including wall-mounted AC and TV. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light with access to a private garden/courtyard area. For baby safety, the ground floor location eliminates fall risks, but the large glass sliding doors and sharp furniture corners would need child-proofing; the outdoor garden area appears enclosed but would need verification."}
