{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Keelung River riverside park", "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment in clean condition with high ceilings, contemporary furniture, and open kitchen with updated appliances. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the river and parkland. For baby safety: the low window seat area and mezzanine level (visible with glass railings) would need childproofing; the coffee table has rounded edges which is good. Clean, well-maintained space with pleasant river views."}
