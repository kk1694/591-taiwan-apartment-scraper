{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unit with modern open-plan kitchen featuring dark cabinetry, white stone countertops, and a breakfast bar. The main living area is very large with polished tile floors, glass partition walls, recessed lighting, and built-in wood panel storage. However, the space has a somewhat commercial/office-like feel with its glass sliding doors, open layout, circular reception-style counter, and a study room with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves resembling an office — this may be a converted commercial space rather than a standard residential apartment. The bathroom is dated compared to the rest, with exposed plumbing and older tile work. For baby safety, the glass partitions and sharp-edged breakfast bar stools are concerns, and the hard tile floors throughout would need area rugs. Natural light appears limited to the kitchen window area."}
