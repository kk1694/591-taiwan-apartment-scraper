{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including marble-look tiles, wood-grain cabinetry, built-in oven, gas stove, and glass-enclosed shower. Very clean open-plan layout on 13th floor of a building with fitness facilities (indicating elevator). For baby safety: no visible balcony railings but the open layout has few sharp corners; bathroom glass door and low toilet would need childproofing. No windows visible in main living area photos which may limit natural light."}
