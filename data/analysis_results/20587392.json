{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with updated furniture and AC units in each room. The glass coffee table and low balcony railings visible in living room could be baby safety concerns. Good natural light from windows in all rooms, appears well-maintained with tile flooring throughout. Being on 1st floor eliminates stair concerns but balcony access needs child-proofing."}
