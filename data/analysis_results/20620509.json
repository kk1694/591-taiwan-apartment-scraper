{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with high-end minimalist design, recessed LED lighting, built-in ceiling AC, modern kitchen with sleek cabinetry, wall-mounted TV, and light wood flooring throughout. The space appears very clean and well-staged. For baby safety, the rounded partition walls and lack of visible sharp corners are positives, though the small dining table/chair area and low coffee tables could need childproofing; no balcony or stairs are visible in the photos. Natural light appears limited based on the photos which rely heavily on artificial lighting, and the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — confirm actual layout and bedroom count. At 4F/14F the building almost certainly has an elevator."}
