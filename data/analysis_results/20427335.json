{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern LED strip lighting, sleek glass sliding door to kitchen, digital door lock, recessed lighting, and clean white walls with polished tile floors. At 49.57 ping on the 10th floor of a 15-story building (very likely to have elevator), this is spacious with multiple rooms visible down a hallway; bedrooms have zebra blinds and wall-mounted AC units. For baby safety, the flat tile floors are easy to clean, no stairs visible, and no dangerous balcony access shown in photos; however the unit is completely empty/unfurnished so all furniture would need to be supplied, and the hard tile floors may need rugs or mats for a crawling baby."}
