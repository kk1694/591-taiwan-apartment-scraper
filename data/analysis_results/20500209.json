{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious first-floor apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, light wood laminate flooring, and air conditioning. The open layout living/dining area is clean with decent furniture. Being on 1F eliminates stair concerns for baby but natural light appears limited with curtained windows; the floor is flat and relatively baby-safe though the glass-top display table and some furniture corners would need attention."}
