{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Stylishly renovated loft-style apartment with modern fixtures, built-in kitchen with induction cooktop, leather sofa, and decorative fireplace feature wall. Major baby safety concern: the unit has an open mezzanine/loft level accessed by steep, narrow stairs with no railings or baby gates, and the loft has only a low glass railing — this is a serious fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler. The unit is clean with decent lighting, but the compact kitchen and loft layout make it less practical for a growing family."}
