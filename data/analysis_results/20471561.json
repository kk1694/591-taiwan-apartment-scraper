{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with clean finishes, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, AC, and wood-tone partition dividers separating the living and bedroom areas. The glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a baby safety concern, and the bedroom has a floor-to-ceiling window/balcony door that should be checked for secure locking and railing safety. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with good built-in storage, though natural light is hard to assess as photos were taken at night; at 17 ping it is a decent size for a couple but may feel tight once baby gear is added."}
