{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious renovated apartment with modern AC, light wood flooring, and clean white walls. The unit includes an internal staircase/loft area which poses a significant safety concern for a crawling baby or toddler - stairs lack safety gates and have open shelving nearby. Glass coffee table with sharp metal legs and glass display cabinets also present baby-proofing challenges. Natural light appears limited due to security grilles on windows."}
