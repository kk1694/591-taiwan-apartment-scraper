{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-furnished apartment in clean condition with light wood flooring, updated kitchen with washing machine, wall-mounted AC, and stylish decor. The glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a concern for a crawling baby, and the balcony visible in the bedroom and living room has sliding glass doors that would need child-proofing. Good natural light from large windows; the 14-floor building on 4F very likely has an elevator, and at 16 ping it is a decent size for a couple with a baby though not spacious."}
