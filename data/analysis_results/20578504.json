{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, central AC, light wood flooring, stylish furniture, and a modern bathroom with soaking tub and bidet toilet. Listed by Elegant Realty (expat housing agent). Being on 5F/5F (top floor) with no elevator info is a concern for a pregnant woman and baby gear; the glass coffee table with sharp metal edges in the living room is a baby safety hazard. Good natural light from large windows, and the spacious open living/dining area is family-friendly, though the description is minimal (agent promotional text only) so specific layout details are unclear."}
