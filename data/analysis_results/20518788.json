{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white finishes, recessed lighting, and contemporary fixtures including an LG refrigerator and induction cooktop. The unit has a nice living area with balcony access and a compact kitchen with breakfast bar. For baby safety, the bar stools are not ideal (tippy), and the balcony sliding doors would need child locks; otherwise, the space has smooth tile floors and rounded furniture with minimal sharp corners."}
