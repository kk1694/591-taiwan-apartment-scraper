{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with dark wood built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, split AC units, and a fully equipped separate kitchen with gas stove and full-size refrigerator. Listed through UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a foreigner-friendly rental agency. The glass-top coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the 1st floor location eliminates stair/balcony fall risks but may limit natural light — images show mostly artificial lighting with only small windows visible in the dining and kitchen areas. Clean and move-in ready but the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag suggesting limited transparency about the property details."}
