{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with Scandinavian-style decor, recessed lighting, built-in storage, and split AC units. Clean and bright with large windows providing natural light. For baby safety: no visible balcony access in photos, but there appears to be a ladder/loft structure in the living area that would need childproofing; mostly rounded furniture with minimal sharp corners. Overall excellent condition managed by Hoyuan Real Estate Agency."}
