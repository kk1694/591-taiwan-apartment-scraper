{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with clean white tile floors, built-in kitchen with gas stove, oven, and microwave, central AC, and multiple rooms including at least two bedrooms. The flat layout with no stairs is baby-safe, and the dark baseboards have slightly sharp edges but are low-profile; windows have secure black-framed fixtures. Listed by Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) on 9F of a 13-story building which very likely has an elevator; natural light is decent from bedroom windows, though the listing description is minimal and no bathroom photos are shown which is a minor red flag."}
