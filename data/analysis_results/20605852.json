{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean laminate flooring, recessed lighting, and contemporary furnishings. The open layout with separate bedroom is spacious at 27.78 ping. For baby safety: the low window sills and accessible electrical outlets near the floor are concerns; the coffee table has metal legs with potential sharp edges. Good natural light through multiple windows, appears clean and move-in ready."}
