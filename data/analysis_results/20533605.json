{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with light wood laminate flooring, recessed LED lighting with cove lighting, built-in white cabinetry, wall-mounted AC, and a clean minimalist design. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at ~37 ping, on the 7th floor of a 22-story building (very likely has elevator). For baby safety, the flat open layout with smooth floors is good, but exposed electrical cables on the walls need to be addressed, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows should be checked for child locks; no visible balcony or stairs which is a plus. The listing description is minimal (just a promotional ad), which is a minor red flag — would need to confirm layout details, number of rooms, and lease terms directly."}
