{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with stylish fixtures including a designer chandelier, recessed lighting, and contemporary finishes throughout. The unit is clean and well-maintained with a modern bathroom featuring glass shower enclosure. Baby safety concerns include the glass balcony railing which appears to have wide gaps, the high bar stools, and glass shower doors. The space may feel cramped at 13 ping for a growing family."}
