{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Very modern, clean unfurnished apartment with polished marble flooring in the living room and light tile flooring in the bedrooms. The unit is in excellent condition with recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and dark-trimmed doorframes throughout. At 48 ping on the 5th floor of a 15-story building (almost certainly has an elevator), this is a spacious layout with multiple bedrooms; the hard tile floors and sliding glass balcony doors with security grilles are baby-safety considerations — the floors are slippery and the balcony access would need childproofing, but overall the space is very clean with no visible sharp corners or hazards. Note: the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — confirm full details with the agent Ms. Huang at 0918055898."}
