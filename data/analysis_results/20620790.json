{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Upscale, well-furnished apartment with luxury finishes including marble coffee table, crystal chandelier, recessed LED lighting, built-in TV cabinet, leather sofas, and polished tile flooring. The living and dining area is spacious and very clean. For baby safety, the marble coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the glass/metal furniture pieces pose minor risks; however, the open floor plan and flat layout are generally baby-friendly. Only living room photos are shown — no kitchen, bedroom, or bathroom views — which is a minor red flag; the 9-story building on 2F very likely has an elevator."}
