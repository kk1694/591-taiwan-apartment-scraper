{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Dated apartment from the 1980s-90s with dark wood built-in cabinets with glass display panels, older style tile flooring, and fixtures throughout. The galley kitchen has older appliances and tiling, bathroom features an old corner bathtub. Baby safety concerns include the balcony with wide-spaced metal railings that a child could slip through, and glass cabinet doors at child height. Reasonably clean but requires significant updating; natural light appears limited in main living area."}
