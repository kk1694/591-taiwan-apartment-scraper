{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, newly renovated apartment with modern fixtures, white glossy tile flooring, built-in wooden cabinetry, and contemporary furniture. The kitchen features modern appliances including a washing machine. For baby safety, the unit appears to be single-level with no visible stairs or balconies in the photos, and corners appear rounded; however, being on 8F/8F (top floor), elevator access should be confirmed. Good natural light from multiple windows throughout."}
