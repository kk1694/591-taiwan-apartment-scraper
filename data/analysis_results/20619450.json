{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, newly renovated apartment with modern finishes including white tile flooring, split AC units, and a contemporary bathroom with glass shower enclosure. The space appears minimalist with simple furniture. For baby safety, the floors are flat with no visible stairs, but the glass shower door and hard tile floors would need attention. Natural light appears limited from small windows visible in photos."}
