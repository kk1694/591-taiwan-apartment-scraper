{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern hotel-style studio with high-end finishes including recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, smart toilet, and stylish tiled bathroom. The unit is clean and well-maintained but at only 7 ping it is essentially a single room with bed, TV desk, and bathroom — very tight for a couple with a baby, with no visible kitchen or separate living area. The French-style balcony railing with decorative ironwork has gaps that would be a concern once the baby is mobile; the 5th floor walkup with no confirmed elevator would also be challenging with a stroller and infant."}
