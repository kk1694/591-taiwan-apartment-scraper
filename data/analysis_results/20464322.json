{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently completed unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including polished tile floors, new kitchen with gas stove, range hood, and stainless steel sink. The unit appears to be on the 5th floor of a 9-story building which very likely has an elevator. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings visible in images 1 and 4 that would need child-proofing; the open floor plan with no stairs is a plus, but the hard tile floors throughout could be a concern for a crawling baby. Good natural light from multiple windows, completely clean and move-in ready, though being unfurnished means significant furniture investment is needed."}
