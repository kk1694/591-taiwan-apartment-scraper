{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Clean, modern studio-style apartment with recessed LED lighting, built-in TV wall unit, and updated kitchen with induction cooktop, front-loading washer, fridge, and microwave. Bathroom has modern tile and stone vanity. The balcony has a solid brick/wood-panel railing at reasonable height but gaps between slats could be a concern for a crawling baby; the string curtain room divider could also be a minor hazard. Natural light appears moderate from the balcony-side windows on the 2nd floor. At 17 ping this is compact for a couple with a baby, and the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag."}
