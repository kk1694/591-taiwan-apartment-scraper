{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "This listing appears to be a small studio apartment (6 ping/19.8 sqm) on the 5th floor of a 6-story building. The description is essentially empty, containing only a generic advertisement for the agent's listing package rather than any actual property details. The very small size would be challenging for a couple with a baby, and the lack of description or images makes it impossible to assess condition, safety features, or amenities. This is a red flag listing that likely lacks substantive information."}
