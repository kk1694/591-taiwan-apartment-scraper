{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a very spacious and modern high-rise apartment with clean finishes, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture. The unit appears well-maintained with large windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has rounded edges but should be monitored; the open floor plan and flat surfaces are generally safe, though the balcony area behind the curtains would need childproofing."}
