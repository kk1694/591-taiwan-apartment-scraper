{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including polished tile floors, marble-look kitchen backsplash, split AC units, and black-frame windows with curtains. The unit appears to have at least 3 rooms plus a kitchen, with clean white walls and no visible safety hazards; windows have security screens which is good for baby safety. Natural light is moderate as some windows face neighboring buildings closely, and exposed ceiling pipes in one room are a minor aesthetic concern but overall this is a very clean, move-in ready space suitable for a family with a baby."}
