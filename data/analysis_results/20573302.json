{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment in good condition with clean white tile and wood floors, split AC units, and contemporary furnishings. Major baby safety concern: the open staircase with wide gaps between steps and no railing enclosure poses a significant fall hazard for crawling infants and toddlers. Good natural light from large windows, and the space appears clean and well-maintained."}
