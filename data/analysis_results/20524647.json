{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "East Fengshan Street, Da'an District, near Da'an MRT Station (407m)", "notes": "Spacious 3BR/2BA whole-floor apartment (32 ping) on 2F of a 4-story walk-up, though listing mentions elevator access. Move-in ready with furniture and appliances included; no pets allowed and cooking is permitted. Being a 2nd floor unit in an older low-rise building, baby safety concerns include potential open balcony (1 balcony noted), stairs if elevator is unreliable, and unknown railing heights; the listing description is minimal (agent promotional text only) with no details on renovation condition, so modernity and actual unit condition cannot be confirmed from text alone. Excellent location near Da'an MRT."}
