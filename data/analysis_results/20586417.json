{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated duplex/loft-style apartment on the top floor (12F/12F) with modern finishes including stylish grey wall panels, crystal chandelier, LED accent lighting, updated L-shaped kitchen with glass backsplash, and two nicely furnished bedrooms with AC. Major baby safety concern: visible internal staircase connecting levels, which would need gating; the glass coffee table has sharp corners; and the balcony area near the kitchen has iron grille railings that appear secure. Being the top floor, it likely gets good natural light but may be hotter in summer; the watermark shows An-Ho Real Estate (安禾房屋), suggesting the An-Ho/Anhe area of Da'an district."}
