{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Fully renovated modern apartment with high-quality finishes including recessed lighting, wood-look flooring, and sleek built-in cabinetry. Features a modern bathroom with glass-enclosed bathtub and smart toilet. For baby safety: no visible balcony concerns, rounded furniture edges, but the glass shower partition and low bed platform may need childproofing. Good natural light through zebra blinds, digital door lock for security. Very clean condition overall."}
