{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Luxurious, high-end modern apartment on the 18th floor of a 24-story building with recessed lighting, marble-style accent walls, polished tile floors, and premium built-in cabinetry in both bedrooms. The open-plan living/dining area is spacious with excellent natural light from large windows; at least two bedrooms are visible, both generously sized with built-in wardrobes and window-seat ledges. The bathroom features a bathtub with shower curtain. For baby safety, the flat floors with no stairs are ideal, but the low window ledges in the bedrooms and coffee table with sharp stone edges would need childproofing. No balcony is visible in the photos, which is a plus for safety. Overall condition is pristine and move-in ready."}
