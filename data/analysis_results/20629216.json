{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be an older ground-floor unit that looks more like a converted office or commercial space than a residential apartment. The main area has drop ceiling tiles, fluorescent lighting, dark marble-pattern flooring, office chairs, and a large table — giving it a strong office/commercial feel. Walls are stained and aged with outdated wallpaper. The bedroom has a tiny window near the ceiling suggesting poor natural light, possibly semi-basement level. For a couple with a baby, the hard stone flooring is a fall hazard, the space feels dark and poorly ventilated, and the overall condition is quite run-down. Red flags: ambiguous residential vs commercial use, very limited natural light, aged and dirty walls, and the listing description is essentially empty (just an ad for the agent's services)."}
