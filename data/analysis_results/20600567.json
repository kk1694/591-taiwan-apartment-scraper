{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern European-style wainscoting, recessed LED lighting, stone accent TV wall, and light wood laminate flooring. The unit appears to be in move-in/move-out transition with bags of belongings scattered on the floor. At 3F in a 5-floor walkup building with no elevator, carrying a stroller and baby supplies up stairs daily would be a significant inconvenience. Natural light comes from windows at the rear but appears limited due to the low floor and proximity to neighboring buildings. The open living area has smooth rounded cabinet edges which is decent for baby safety, but the wooden slat room divider has gaps a child could reach through."}
