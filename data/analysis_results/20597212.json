{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with high-end finishes. Living room has dark marble-look flooring with recessed lighting and large windows. Kitchen features sleek white cabinetry with modern appliances. Bedroom has clean light wood flooring with venetian blinds. Bathroom is spacious with glass-enclosed shower, marble-look tiles, and modern fixtures. For baby safety: the dark stone flooring in the living room is hard and slippery, the glass shower partition has sharp edges, and the large windows should be checked for secure locks; however, the unit is unfurnished with no visible stairs or dangerous railings, which is a plus. At 46 ping on the 6th floor, this is a spacious and well-lit unit, but the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag."}
