{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinsheng South Road Section 1, Zhongzheng District, near Dongmen MRT (431m)", "notes": "Spacious 3BR/2BA move-in ready apartment in elevator building with security guard. Furnished with appliances including AC, fridge, washer, and gas stove; cooking allowed. Good for a family with baby — elevator access is a plus, but no pets allowed. Description is minimal (appears to be a broker repost), so condition/modernity and baby-safety details (balcony railings, sharp corners) cannot be confirmed without viewing photos. Management fee of NT$2,700/month is additional. Two months deposit required."}
