{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes — glossy white tile floors, recessed LED lighting, sleek grey kitchen cabinetry with under-cabinet lighting, split AC units, and doors still wrapped in protective plastic indicating a newly constructed unit. At 8F/26F in a high-rise building, an elevator is virtually certain. The unit is unfurnished with clean open spaces and no visible balcony railings or stairs to worry about for baby safety; the polished tile floors are very slippery which could be a concern for a crawling baby, so area rugs are recommended. Natural light appears moderate from the dark-framed windows, but views face neighboring buildings at close range."}
