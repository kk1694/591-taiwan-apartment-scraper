{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with clean wood-tone finishes, recessed lighting, and contemporary built-in furniture. Good natural light from multiple windows with adjustable blinds. For baby safety: the raised platform bed in the second bedroom has no railings which could be hazardous, and there's a small step between rooms that would need attention; otherwise the space appears clean with rounded furniture corners."}
