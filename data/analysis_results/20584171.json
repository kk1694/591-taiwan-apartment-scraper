{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern apartment with excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows in living room and balcony access from bedroom. Clean condition with quality finishes including recessed lighting, hardwood floors in bedrooms, and built-in storage. For baby safety, the balcony railings appear to have adequate height but the glass coffee table and open balcony access would need attention; no stairs visible in this single-floor unit."}
