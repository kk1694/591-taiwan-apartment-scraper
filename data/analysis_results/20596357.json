{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "The listing description only contains an advertisement for agent packages (NT$240/listing), not actual property details. At 31 ping (102.3 sqm) and NT$88,000/month in Nangang, this is a reasonably sized apartment for a family. Floor 8 of 12 suggests a mid-rise building likely with an elevator, but cannot confirm. No images or detailed description available to assess modernity, baby safety features, natural light, or condition - recommend visiting in person before deciding."}
