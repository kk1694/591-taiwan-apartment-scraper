{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with marble-look tiles, recessed lighting, split AC units, and a clean minimalist white interior. The 1F unit has a covered outdoor patio/courtyard area with glass roof, and sliding glass doors provide access and natural light. For baby safety, the tile floors are smooth and slippery, the bar-height gold metal stools have no back support and could tip, and the sliding glass doors to the patio need child locks; no dangerous stairs or balcony railings visible. Listed through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency, the unit appears unfurnished and in excellent move-in condition at 61 ping, which is very spacious for a family."}
