{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Reasonably clean older apartment on 7F/7F with wooden flooring, multiple rooms (living room, at least 2 bedrooms, a study/office), and basic furnishings. The unit has good natural light from large windows on the upper floor with city views, but being the top floor of a 7-story building it may lack an elevator and could be hot in summer. For baby safety, the windows appear to have no visible child locks or guards and are at accessible heights; the hardwood floors are smooth but the furniture corners (dining table, TV stand, desk) would need padding."}
