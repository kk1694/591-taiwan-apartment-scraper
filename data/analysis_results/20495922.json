{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment in Da'an with recessed lighting, split AC units, and a well-furnished living area with balcony access through sliding glass doors. The unit includes a mezzanine/loft level accessed by open stairs without railings, which is a significant baby safety hazard; the low-ceiling loft windows also have venetian blinds with cords that pose a strangulation risk. Good natural light from large windows, overall clean condition, but the open staircase and loft design make this problematic for a family with a baby."}
