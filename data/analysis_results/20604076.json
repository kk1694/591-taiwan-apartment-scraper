{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment (46 ping) listed via UR HOUSE agency targeting expats. Furnishings and fixtures are dated (crystal chandeliers, dark leather sofas, old window-unit ACs, 90s-era wood cabinetry) but the unit is clean and well-maintained with marble and hardwood floors. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with metal legs and the raised platform bed in the second bedroom are concerns; the bathroom has a glass shower partition with a step, and window grilles appear present which is good for child safety. Natural light appears decent with multiple windows in both bedrooms, though no balcony is visible in the photos."}
