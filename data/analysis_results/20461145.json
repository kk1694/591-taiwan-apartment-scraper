{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older-style unfurnished apartment with dated terracotta tile flooring, old-style ceiling lights, and window-unit AC. The space is clean but shows signs of age including worn wall patches and exposed wiring. Natural light appears limited due to small, high strip windows. The flat open layout with no visible stairs is good for baby safety, though the bathroom doorway lacks a door threshold which may need attention."}
