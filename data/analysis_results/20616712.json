{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with stylish marble accent TV wall, recessed lighting, wood-tone laminate flooring, and built-in storage. The living room has high ceilings with decorative wooden beams and large windows. The entryway features a video intercom system and a quality security door, suggesting a well-managed building. For baby safety, the open shelving units have sharp metal edges that would need baby-proofing, and the marble-topped bench near the entrance has hard corners; however, the flat flooring throughout with no stairs visible is a plus. The 3F/11F placement in an 11-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Overall very clean and in excellent condition, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad) which is a minor red flag — worth verifying details directly."}
