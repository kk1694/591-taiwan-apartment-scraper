{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older renovated apartment with freshly painted walls and new laminate flooring, but dated kitchen with old tiles and basic fixtures. The unit is clean and spacious with multiple rooms and decent natural light from several windows with security grilles. For baby safety, the windows have protective bars which is good, no visible stairs or dangerous balconies, though the kitchen leads to what appears to be a utility balcony area that would need childproofing."}
