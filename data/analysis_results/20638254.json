{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Fuxing South Road Section 1, Da'an District, near Zhongxiao Fuxing MRT Station", "notes": "High-end furnished studio (獨立套房) in elevator building on 10F/15F, marketed for expats/corporate executives. At 7 ping this is very small for a couple with a baby - it's a single studio unit. Includes balcony (check railing safety for baby), AC, washer, fridge, and furniture. Good location near dual MRT lines and SOGO, but NT$58,000 plus NT$2,900 management fee is steep for the tiny size. No pets allowed and listed for 1-2 occupants - verify landlord accepts a family with infant. Red flag: the description is mostly marketing fluff with minimal property details."}
