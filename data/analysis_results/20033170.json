{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylishly renovated apartment with LED cove lighting, built-in kitchen with oven, recessed AC, and high-end finishes throughout. The bedroom area is on a raised platform separated by a glass partition from the living area, which is a tripping/fall hazard for a crawling baby; the metal-framed shelving unit also has sharp corners. Natural light comes from floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom; the living area appears to rely more on artificial light. Clean and in excellent condition, but at 18 ping it functions as a large studio/1-bedroom, which may feel tight for a couple with a baby and all the baby gear."}
