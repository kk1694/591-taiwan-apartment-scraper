{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment with brand-new fixtures, Murphy wall bed, Panasonic fridge, front-loading washer, built-in kitchenette, AC, and a desk workspace. The building common area (image 2) shows a high-end marble-clad lobby/hallway suggesting a newer building with elevator. For a couple expecting a baby, this is a concern: it is a single open-room studio (~38 sqm) with no separate bedroom, and the fold-down bed mechanism could pose a pinch hazard for a crawling child. Natural light appears moderate with one window side; the space is very clean but quite compact for a growing family."}
