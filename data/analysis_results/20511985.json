{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained older apartment with dated but clean traditional Taiwanese decor and wooden furniture. Spacious layout (45 ping) with good natural light from large windows on high floor (11F). For baby safety: glass display cabinets with sharp corners, exposed electrical cords on floor, and low windowsills need attention; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings in photos."}
