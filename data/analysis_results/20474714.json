{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 50-ping apartment in Da'an with renovated finishes but traditional-style heavy wooden furniture; crystal chandelier in dining area, recessed lighting, and decorative room dividers give it a mid-range Taiwanese aesthetic rather than truly modern. The balcony is long and has tall metal railings with vertical bars which are good for baby safety, though the gaps between bars and potted plants on the ledge could be minor concerns. Good natural light from large living room windows; the unit is clean and well-maintained, but the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — verify layout, number of rooms, and lease terms directly."}
