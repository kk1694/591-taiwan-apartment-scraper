{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and stylishly renovated apartment with clean minimalist decor, wood flooring, and contemporary furniture. Being on the 1st floor of a 4-story building, it likely has no elevator which is actually convenient with a stroller. For baby safety, the open floor plan is good but the clothing rack with wire basket at floor level and folding chair could pose minor hazards; no visible balcony or stairs which is positive."}
