{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, wood-accent ceiling details, and contemporary furniture. The living room is spacious with large windows providing excellent natural light. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp edges that would need padding, and the glass sliding doors to the balcony/utility area should be secured; the tile floors are very slippery. The bedrooms appear clean and well-maintained with a minimalist design, though the sloped ceiling angles in the bedrooms suggest this is a top-floor unit which may get hot in summer."}
