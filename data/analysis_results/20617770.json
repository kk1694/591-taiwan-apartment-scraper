Excellent natural light through large windows with mountain views typical of Beitou. For baby safety, note the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom and living area may need childproofing; no visible stairs or sharp corners are major concerns. Overall clean, well-maintained condition with neutral minimalist decor."}
