{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, modern recessed lighting, and light wood flooring throughout. The spacious open layout with no visible stairs or sharp corners is good for baby safety, though the enclosed balcony area with French doors would need baby gates once the child is mobile. Being on the 5th floor of a 5-story building without confirmed elevator access could be challenging with a stroller and newborn."}
