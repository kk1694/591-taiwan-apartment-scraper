{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment on the top floor (15F) with sleek finishes, recessed LED lighting, marble-look walls, and contemporary built-in cabinetry. At least 2 bedrooms plus a third room with wood-look flooring and large windows providing excellent natural light and city views. For baby safety, the tile floors are smooth but hard (consider rugs), and the windows appear to have secure frames but no visible child locks; no dangerous balcony access is visible. Being top floor in a 15-story building strongly suggests an elevator; the listing description is minimal (agent promotion text only) so no location specifics beyond Wanhua district."}
