{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with bright white tile floors, leather L-shaped sofa, and fully equipped open kitchen with white cabinets. Good natural light from large windows. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, but overall the open floor plan is spacious and relatively safe for a family with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access from the main living area."}
