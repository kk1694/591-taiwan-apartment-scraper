{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Chongyang Road (重陽路), Nangang District, near Nangang Software Park MRT Station", "notes": "Large 3BR/2BA unit (49 ping) on 5F/15F elevator building with flat parking, near Nangang Software Park MRT (435m). Mid-range finishes described as 3+ years old; without interior photos it is hard to confirm modernity or baby safety details like balcony railings and sharp corners. A balcony is listed which warrants inspection for child safety; the spacious layout and proximity to transit, schools, and amenities are positives for a growing family, but the NT$79,900 rent plus NT$5,419 management fee is a significant monthly cost, and no pets are allowed."}
