{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, polished tile floors, and modern bathroom vanity with digital panel. The unit appears to have multiple rooms and a large open living area with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling sliding doors leading to a balcony with metal railings. For baby safety, the balcony railings appear adequately spaced but should be checked in person; the hard tile floors are slippery and would benefit from play mats. The apartment is mostly unfurnished, which is a plus for customizing a baby-friendly layout. Being on 2F of a 5F building with no visible elevator, stairs may be challenging with a stroller."}
