{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "This is NOT a residential apartment — it is a Japanese-style izakaya (居酒屋) restaurant/bar, a commercial space on the ground floor. Images show a bar counter, dining tables, kitchen equipment, sake bottles, Japanese decorations, and restaurant signage. Completely unsuitable for residential use or for a couple expecting a baby. Major red flag: this listing appears to be for a commercial storefront rental, not a home."}
