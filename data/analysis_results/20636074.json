{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with fresh white walls, new light wood laminate flooring, modern LED ceiling lights, black-framed sliding glass doors to a small balcony, wall-mounted AC, and intercom system. The unit is spacious at 40 ping with clean, open rooms and decent natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the balcony has full-height glass sliding doors which is good, no visible stairs or sharp corners, and the flat layout is stroller-friendly; however the bathroom glimpsed in image 5 appears to have an older tile finish contrasting with the renovated living areas, and the apartment is completely empty so all furnishing costs would be on the tenant."}
