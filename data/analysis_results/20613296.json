{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures - traditional wooden door, old-style drop ceiling, retro kitchen with patterned tiles and basic appliances. Spacious living area and bedrooms with laminate flooring in clean condition. For baby safety: no visible balcony railings in photos but glass sliding doors lead to balcony area; kitchen floor tiles may be slippery; traditional wooden furniture has some hard edges. Natural light appears limited in bedrooms. The 3rd floor without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller."}
