{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end renovated apartment with designer ceiling details, quality hardwood floors, recessed LED lighting, and a well-equipped kitchen with built-in dishwasher, gas stove, range hood, and ample cabinetry. At 69 ping this is a spacious family-sized unit on 2F of a 13-story building. The balcony has horizontal slatted metal railings with gaps that could be a concern for a crawling baby or toddler and would need childproofing; a gas water heater is mounted on the balcony wall. The open floor plan with large floor-to-ceiling windows provides excellent natural light, and the overall condition is very clean and move-in ready, though the listing description is minimal (agent advertisement only), which is a minor red flag — verify actual layout and room count in person."}
