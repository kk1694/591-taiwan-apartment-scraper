{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment with dated 1990s-2000s style decor including ornate ceiling details and classic chandeliers. The unit is spacious with polished tile floors but shows signs of age with exposed wiring on the floor and an older bathroom with decorative tile borders. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout and lack of visible balcony railings in images require assessment; the open layout is positive but the unit needs modernization and proper electrical work."}
