{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a loft-style duplex apartment with a prominent open spiral staircase with floating wooden treads and no risers — a major baby safety hazard as a crawling child could easily fall through the gaps or off the open sides. The unit is clean with light tile flooring and decent natural light from a balcony, but the interior design feels dated (early 2000s stone accent wall, ornate ceiling medallion). The mezzanine loft area accessed by the staircase likely serves as the bedroom, and the kitchen area with washing machine is compact; overall not recommended for a family with a baby due to the dangerous staircase."}
