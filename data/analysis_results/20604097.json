{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with dated but clean furnishings including leather sofas, marble-top dining table, and dark wood bed frames. The bathroom is reasonably modern with a glass shower enclosure. At 38 ping on the 2nd floor of a 4-story building (likely no elevator, walk-up), the unit has decent natural light through windows with security grilles. For baby safety, the tile floors are smooth and easy to clean, but the glass shower door, sharp-cornered coffee table, and furniture edges would need child-proofing; no dangerous balcony access is visible. Listed through UR HOUSE foreign rental agency which may simplify the process for a foreign couple."}
