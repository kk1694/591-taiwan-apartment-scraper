{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with recessed LED lighting, sleek built-in cabinetry, modern kitchen with gas stove and dishwasher, and contemporary furniture. Excellent condition with clean lines and minimal sharp corners. The tile floors are smooth but may be slippery; good natural light from large windows. Baby-friendly layout with open floor plan, though the coffee table has sharp edges that may need corner guards."}
