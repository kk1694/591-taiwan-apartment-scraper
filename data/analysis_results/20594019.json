{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with polished hardwood floors, modern kitchen with light cabinetry, and excellent natural light from large windows. The space appears clean with a decorative accent wall. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows and balcony sliding doors need childproofing locks; the window sills in bedrooms could be climbing hazards for a toddler. Being on 7F/7F (top floor), elevator status is uncertain but likely exists given the building quality."}
