{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "High-end modern apartment marketed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) with upscale finishes including recessed ceiling AC, marble bathroom with bathtub and glass-enclosed shower, fully equipped white kitchen with washing machine and induction cooktop, and two rooms (master bedroom plus study/second room). Very clean and well-maintained. For baby safety, the bathtub has no guard rail and glass shower door edges should be noted; the living room has a low glass coffee table with sharp metal edges. No visible balcony railings or dangerous stairs. Good natural light from large windows in both rooms. The 6th floor of a 13-story building almost certainly has an elevator."}
