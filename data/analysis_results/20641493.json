{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with recessed lighting, split AC, air purifier, and contemporary furniture including reclining sofas. Kitchen is well-equipped with gas stove, range hood, and microwave. Balcony has a solid half-wall with metal railings on top - would need child safety measures. The spacious tiled floors and minimal furniture are baby-friendly, though sharp coffee table corners should be addressed. Good natural light from large sliding glass doors."}
