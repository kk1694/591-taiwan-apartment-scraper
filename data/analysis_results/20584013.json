{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Semi-renovated older apartment with new light-colored laminate flooring and freshly painted white walls, but the kitchen and bathrooms appear dated with old tile work and basic fixtures. The unit is spacious and mostly unfurnished with good natural light from large windows and a balcony; the balcony has metal railings that appear adequate but would need childproofing. The kitchen has an exposed gas water heater and older stainless steel sink area which feel outdated; overall the apartment is clean but a mixed renovation — the description is suspiciously sparse (just a generic agent ad), which is a minor red flag."}
