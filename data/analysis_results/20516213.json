{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with hardwood floors, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and a compact but well-equipped kitchen with induction cooktop, range hood, and front-loading washer. The unit appears to have at least two rooms plus a living area with frosted glass partition, providing decent space at 16 ping. For baby safety, the windows appear to have low sills which would need guards, and the frosted glass partition has sharp corners worth padding. Natural light is good from the large windows with greenery views; being on 4F of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
