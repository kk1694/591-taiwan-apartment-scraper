{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated 90s-style decor including ornate ceiling moldings, marble floors, and dark wood furniture. The balcony visible from living room has metal railings that appear adequate but would need baby-proofing. Good natural light through large windows and balcony access. Unit is clean but the glass coffee table with sharp corners poses a hazard for a crawling baby. The space is spacious at 34 ping but the aged aesthetic and window-unit AC suggest an older building."}
