{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with recessed LED lighting, wood laminate flooring, and split AC units. Large balcony visible with greenery views but balcony railings appear to have wider gaps that could concern parents with a mobile baby. Currently cluttered with personal items suggesting lived-in condition. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows; overall clean and well-maintained."}
