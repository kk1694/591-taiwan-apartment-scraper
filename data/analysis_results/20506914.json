{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older Da'an apartment on 2F of a 4-story walk-up with dated fixtures, tile floors, wall-mounted fans, and older-style AC units. The unit is very spacious at 31.69 ping but currently cluttered with boxes and belongings, making condition hard to fully assess; it appears to need cleaning and possibly renovation. For a baby, the hard tile floors throughout the main areas are a concern for falls, exposed wiring is visible in the bedroom, and window security grilles could be a fire safety issue; however the large open floor plan provides ample space, and the 2nd floor walk-up is manageable with a stroller."}
