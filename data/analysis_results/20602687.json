{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern marble-look TV wall, LED accent lighting, wood-tone laminate flooring, Panasonic fridge, washer-dryer, and induction cooktop. The bedroom has a large bed with padded headboard and ample built-in wardrobe storage. For baby safety, the low open TV console shelving has accessible sharp edges, and the kitchen window has security bars but no visible balcony hazards; natural light appears moderate with windows in the bedroom and kitchen. The space is very clean and well-staged, though the description is minimal (agent listing placeholder) which is a minor red flag — verify actual layout and whether it truly is 24 ping or if multiple units are combined."}
