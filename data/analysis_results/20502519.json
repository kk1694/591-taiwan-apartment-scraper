{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with sleek grey cabinetry, built-in appliances, contemporary lighting fixtures, and high-quality finishes throughout. Good natural light from large windows; the living area has a glass coffee table with sharp corners that would need childproofing. The bedroom has a balcony with floor-to-ceiling glass doors - balcony railing appears adequate but access should be secured for baby safety. Clean and well-maintained condition, appears professionally managed by UR House rental service."}
