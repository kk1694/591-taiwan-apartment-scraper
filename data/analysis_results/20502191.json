Clean separate kitchen with gas stove and microwave. Spacious dining area with designer pendant lights. Living space appears baby-safe with rounded furniture edges and no visible balcony hazards. Good natural light through large curtained windows. Being on 11F/14F strongly suggests elevator building."}
