{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older renovated apartment with dated furniture and light blue/cream paint; appears clean but somewhat worn. Being on 4F/4F (top floor with no visible elevator) is a concern for carrying a stroller/baby items. The space is relatively spacious with multiple rooms suitable for a family, but furniture has sharp corners and low electrical outlets may need childproofing."}
