{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older building with mixed renovation levels - entry area and dining/kitchen look dated with worn tile floors and older fixtures, while one bedroom shows newer furniture. Bathroom is clean but basic. For baby safety, the apartment appears single-level with no visible stairs, but the coffee table has sharp corners and some furniture edges may need childproofing. Limited natural light visible in most rooms."}
