{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with recessed lighting, air conditioning, built-in cabinetry, and a fully equipped kitchen with toaster oven and microwave. The glass coffee table with sharp edges is a baby safety concern, and the sliding glass-panel doors between rooms could pinch small fingers. Good natural light from large windows with secure metal-frame grilles; the 15-floor building on the 4th floor almost certainly has an elevator. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), clean and move-in ready condition overall."}
