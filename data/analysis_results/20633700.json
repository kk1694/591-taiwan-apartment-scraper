{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern and well-renovated 1F apartment with high-quality wood-panel ceilings, herringbone flooring, built-in cabinetry, and a private garden/patio area. The interior is spacious and clean with a stylish dining area and ample storage. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the ground-floor garden access with a hose left on the ground is a minor concern; however, the 1F location means no staircase or balcony fall risk, which is a major plus. Natural light appears moderate indoors but the outdoor garden area compensates well. Listed through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency, a foreigner-friendly agent."}
