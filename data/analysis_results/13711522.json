{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wenshan District", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with recessed LED lighting, light wood laminate flooring, built-in white cabinetry, and a sleek galley kitchen with gas stove and range hood. The unit is unfurnished and in excellent clean condition with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the bedroom has a raised platform bed area with an edge that could be a tripping/falling hazard; the balcony visible from the bedroom has metal railings that appear adequately spaced, and the large living room windows appear to be floor-to-near-ceiling but are fixed glass. At 7F/22F the building almost certainly has an elevator. Spacious at 37 ping with a minimalist, move-in-ready feel."}
