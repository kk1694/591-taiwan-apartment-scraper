{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex-style loft apartment with high ceilings, contemporary fixtures, and wood flooring throughout. Major baby safety concern: this is a split-level unit with internal stairs leading to an upper loft area - the stairs have no safety gate and the open design poses fall risks for crawling babies/toddlers. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access; clean and well-maintained condition."}
