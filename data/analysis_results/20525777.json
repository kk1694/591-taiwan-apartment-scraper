{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with traditional dark wood furniture throughout, including carved wooden sofa set and large round dining table with lazy susan. The space is clean but dated with beige tile floors and window AC units. For baby safety, the wooden furniture has sharp corners and decorative carved elements that could be hazardous; windows have security bars which is good. Natural light appears limited based on the photos. Kitchen is functional but older style."}
