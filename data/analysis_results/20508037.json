{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained luxury apartment with classical European-style decor (ornate furniture, crown molding, crystal chandeliers) rather than modern style. Very clean with good natural light from large windows. The glass coffee table with sharp corners and ornate metal ironwork divider could pose baby safety concerns; the slick tile floors may also be slippery. Overall spacious at 38 ping with quality finishes but dated aesthetic."}
