{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin, near hillside/mountainous area", "notes": "Spacious, upscale apartment in excellent condition with hardwood floors, recessed LED ceiling lighting, central AC, and modern kitchen with marble dining table. The balcony has glass railings which are a baby safety concern as a toddler could potentially climb furniture near them; the low coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. Abundant natural light from large windows and balcony with beautiful mountain/greenery views; the unit is clean, well-maintained, and on the 11th floor of a 14-story building which almost certainly has an elevator."}
