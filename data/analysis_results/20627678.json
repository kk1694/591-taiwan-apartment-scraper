{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District, near tree-lined boulevard", "notes": "Very spacious modern luxury apartment (77 ping) on 15F of a 21-story high-rise in Da'an. The unit is unfurnished with pristine polished tile floors, clean white walls, modern entry door with digital lock, and floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors opening to a large balcony with wooden decking. Excellent natural light from the high floor. For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors should be kept locked and the balcony railing height should be verified; the flat open layout with no stairs and minimal sharp corners is very baby-friendly. The unit appears brand new or recently renovated and in immaculate condition, though being unfurnished means significant furniture investment will be needed."}
