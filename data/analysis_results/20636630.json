{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a newly renovated, very modern apartment with high-quality finishes including marble accents, recessed lighting, and split AC units. The space is clean and bright with large sliding glass doors leading to a balcony area. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings visible through the glass doors that a toddler could potentially climb, and the hard tile flooring throughout may need rugs for cushioning. The unit appears unfurnished with minimal furniture shown."}
