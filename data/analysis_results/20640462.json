{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with high-end marble accent walls, recessed LED cove lighting, marble-look porcelain tile floors, and modern split AC units. The kitchen is well-equipped with a galley layout, gas stove, large fridge, and ample cabinetry. Being on 1F is convenient for a stroller but the sliding glass doors to what appears to be a small patio/balcony area would need child-proofing; the TV console has sharp corners at low height. The unit is unfurnished and very clean, offering a blank slate, though natural light appears limited with most illumination coming from artificial sources. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and actual room count."}
