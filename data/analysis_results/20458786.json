{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a clean, well-maintained apartment with traditional Taiwanese wood furniture and decor from the 2000s era. The unit features a spacious living and dining area with tile floors, window AC units, and adequate natural light through balcony windows. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners is a concern, and the balcony access should be checked for secure railings; no stairs visible which is good for a crawling baby."}
