{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with high-end finishes including custom walnut cabinetry, designer pendant lighting, white quartz kitchen island, and quality hardwood flooring throughout. The open-plan kitchen/living area is well-designed with a stylish bar-style counter. For baby safety, the open wine rack shelving with many small cubbies could be a climbing hazard, and the tall bar stools near the kitchen island are a concern; the heavy live-edge dining table has sharp corners that would need padding. Good natural light from windows visible in the kitchen area, and the 13-floor building on the 2nd floor almost certainly has an elevator. Very clean and move-in ready condition with a sophisticated design aesthetic."}
