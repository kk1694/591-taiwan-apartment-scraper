{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylish studio-style apartment with loft sleeping area accessed by a steep ladder-style staircase — a significant safety hazard for a baby/toddler and inconvenient for a pregnant person. The unit features high ceilings, large windows with excellent natural light, light wood flooring, built-in storage, AC, and a small kitchenette. The open metal railing around the loft bed and the steep stairs with no gate are major baby safety concerns; the space is also essentially a single open room which may feel cramped for a couple with a baby at 14.5 ping despite the clever use of vertical space."}
