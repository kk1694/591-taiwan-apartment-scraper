{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large, renovated apartment with polished marble tile flooring in the living area, recessed LED lighting, crystal chandeliers, and wood-laminate flooring in bedrooms. The kitchen is modern with updated cabinetry and gas stove. For baby safety: the metal clothing rails in bedrooms have sharp edges and poles at child height that are a concern; the highly polished marble floor in the living room is very slippery and a fall hazard for toddlers. Windows appear small, limiting natural light in some rooms, and one bedroom connects to an older unrenovated section with mismatched finishes, suggesting uneven renovation quality. At 3F with no elevator evidence, carrying a stroller up stairs could be inconvenient."}
