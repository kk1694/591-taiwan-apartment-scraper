{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style Taiwanese apartment (3F of 4-story walkup) with laminate wood flooring, drop ceilings, and dated fixtures. The unit is spacious at 36 ping with a master bedroom plus at least two additional bedrooms, making it suitable size-wise for a family. The living room has large sliding glass doors to a balcony which could be a safety concern for a toddler; natural light appears limited in the bedrooms (frosted/small windows), and the dark baseboards and overall aesthetic feel dated though reasonably clean. No kitchen or bathroom photos were provided, which is a red flag — important to verify those areas before committing."}
