{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious, spacious modern apartment with high-end finishes including marble/stone accent walls, recessed lighting, and quality furniture. The open floor plan with large windows provides excellent natural light. For baby safety, the balcony visible in image 2 has horizontal railings that a toddler could potentially climb, and the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. Overall very clean and well-maintained with no visible red flags."}
