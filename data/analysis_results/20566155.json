{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with mixed aesthetics — the living room has white built-in cabinetry and tile floors, while the bedrooms feature dated wood-paneled walls, parquet flooring, and older window-mounted AC units. The unit is clean and unfurnished with decent natural light from windows with security grilles. For baby safety, the tile floors are slippery, the open built-in shelving has sharp corners at child height, and the balcony area visible in the living room should be checked for railing gaps; the 2F location means no elevator is critical but the building age (7-story, older construction) makes an elevator unlikely."}
