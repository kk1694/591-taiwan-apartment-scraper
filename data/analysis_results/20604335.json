{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with Japandi-style wood and white interior, recessed LED lighting, split AC, and light wood flooring throughout. Listed by Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), the unit appears very clean with no visible stairs, rounded cabinet edges, and a balcony with floor-to-ceiling glass doors behind sheer curtains—balcony railing condition is not visible and should be confirmed. Good natural light from the large windows; at 10F/12F the building almost certainly has an elevator, and the overall condition is excellent for a family with a baby."}
