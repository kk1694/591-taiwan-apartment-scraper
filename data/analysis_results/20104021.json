{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated open-plan studio with modern recessed lighting, light wood-look flooring, concrete accent wall, wall-mounted TV, built-in storage, desk area, and central AC. Very clean and stylish condition. For baby safety: the space is mostly open and flat with no stairs, but the metal-framed chair has sharp edges, and the windows appear to have low sills that would need childproofing; natural light is moderate from side-facing windows but the unit appears to face other buildings closely. Note this is a large studio layout (no separate bedroom) which may feel cramped for a family despite the 23.65 ping size, and the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag."}
