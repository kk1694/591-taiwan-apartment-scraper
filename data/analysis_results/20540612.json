{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Near Cosmed/康是美 and McDonald's, Zhongzheng District", "notes": "All images show only the building exterior — an old, weathered 4-story walk-up with visibly aged concrete, exposed pipes, metal awnings, and commercial shops on the ground floor (Lo Gusta, bakery). No interior photos are provided, making it impossible to assess the actual apartment condition, layout, or baby safety. The building appears quite run-down from the outside with rust stains and aging infrastructure. Major red flags: no interior photos at all, very high price (NT$63,800) for what appears to be a dated building with no elevator on the 2nd floor, and the listing description is just a generic agent advertisement with no real property details."}
