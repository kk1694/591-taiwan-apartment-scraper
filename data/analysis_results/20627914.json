{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Ximen, Wanhua District", "notes": "Clean, empty apartment with freshly painted white walls and white tile floors throughout. The unit is unfurnished with multiple rooms, a basic tiled kitchen area with accordion door, and wall-mounted AC units. The building appears older (2F of 8-story walkup) with dated window frames and baseboards, but is in decent maintained condition. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard and slippery, the balcony/outdoor area visible in image 1 has a low wall that would need childproofing, and there are no obvious sharp corners but the step-downs between rooms could be a trip hazard. Natural light is moderate from windows but somewhat blocked by neighboring buildings. The watermark indicates a Ximen-area real estate agent (02-2388-6577)."}
