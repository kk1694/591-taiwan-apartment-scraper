{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with 2 bedrooms (master + small room suitable for nursery), modern kitchen with built-in oven, and clean bathrooms. High floor (14F/19F) in a newer building strongly suggests elevator. For baby safety: no visible balcony access in images, glass coffee table in living room should be addressed, floor is smooth tile throughout. Good natural light from large windows, clean condition with minimal clutter."}
