{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older Beitou 1F apartment with renovated wood-laminate flooring but dated kitchen (white tile, exposed pipes, old fixtures) and a worn bathroom area with small doorways. Natural light appears limited, especially in the living areas which feel dim; the bedroom has windows but they seem to face close surroundings. For baby safety, the cluttered hallway area near the bathroom has items on the floor and small step-ups between rooms, and the kitchen is open to the living space with no separation, which could be hazardous for a crawling child. Being on the 1st floor of a 4-story walkup in an older building, there is no elevator, but ground-floor access is convenient for a stroller."}
