{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including marble-look TV wall, LED accent lighting, wood-look flooring, and contemporary fixtures. Kitchen includes washer/dryer combo and large refrigerator. The open layout with no visible stairs and relatively minimal sharp corners is decent for baby safety, though the low TV stand and open shelving would need baby-proofing. Good natural light visible from kitchen area. Very clean condition overall."}
