{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern loft-style studio with high ceilings, stylish fixtures, stainless steel kitchen, and contemporary furnishings. Major baby safety concern: the open loft mezzanine has only low railings and requires ladder/stair access, posing a significant fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access, clean and well-maintained condition."}
