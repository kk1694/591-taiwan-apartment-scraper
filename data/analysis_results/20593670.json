{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, recessed lighting, and built-in ceiling AC units. Multiple bedrooms visible with quality built-in wardrobes and furniture. The apartment appears very clean with minimal sharp corners; the balcony has metal railings visible in image 1 which would need baby-proofing. Natural light is limited as windows appear to face other buildings. At 53 ping this is spacious for a family but images only show bedrooms and balcony - no kitchen, bathroom, or living areas are shown."}
