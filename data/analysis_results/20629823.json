{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with beautiful hardwood floors, recessed lighting, and modern AC unit. The open floor plan with large living/dining area is excellent for a family, and the flat layout with no visible stairs is baby-safe. Good natural light from large windows, though marble coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing. Clean condition overall with fire extinguisher visible indicating safety awareness."}
