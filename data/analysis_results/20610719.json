{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with modern fixtures including ceiling fan, AC, contemporary kitchen with gas stove and range hood. Large balcony with diamond-pattern safety railing is concerning for baby safety - gaps may allow a toddler to climb. Floor-to-ceiling windows in bedroom with balcony access also require childproofing. Overall clean condition with good natural light. Being on 5F of 6F building without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller and baby."}
