{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Brand new, unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including recessed lighting, split AC, polished tile floors, modern bathroom with glass shower partition, and a digital door lock. The unit appears to be on a high floor (8F/26F) in a new high-rise building, which very likely has an elevator. For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery, the balcony has a glass door that should be kept locked, and the unit is completely empty so you would need to furnish it and add corner protectors yourself. Good natural light from multiple windows, very clean move-in ready condition, though the listing description is minimal (just a broker ad) which is a minor red flag — verify layout details and actual room count in person."}
