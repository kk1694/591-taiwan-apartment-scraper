{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is a multi-level townhouse/walk-up (1F of 6F low-rise with visible staircase in dining area), not a flat apartment. The interior is clean with white tile floors and freshly painted walls, but furnishings are dated with traditional Taiwanese wooden cabinetry. Major baby safety concern: the staircase visible in image 4 has no gate and would need child-proofing; the 1F windows have security grilles which is good. Natural light is limited as 1F ground-level windows face close neighboring buildings. The listing description is essentially empty (just an ad for the agent platform), which is a red flag for transparency."}
