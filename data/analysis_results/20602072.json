{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with clean white finishes, leather sofa, and updated kitchen with full appliances. The unit has good natural light through large windows and appears to have 2-3 bedrooms including one that could serve as a nursery. Baby safety considerations include the raised tatami platform with step edges and low furniture corners; the apartment is single-level with no stairs. The 18-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
