Very clean and well-maintained with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the balcony visible in image 1 has railings that appear safe but should be verified; the hard tile floors and sharp cabinet corners may need padding. Includes a spacious walk-in closet with organizers."}
