{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin, near Keelung River riverside park", "notes": "Brand new unfurnished unit with industrial-loft style exposed concrete ceiling, modern white kitchen with induction cooktop, and sleek glass-enclosed bathroom. The apartment is very clean with good natural light and a river view. Baby safety concerns include the exposed ceiling pipes/conduits within reach from furniture, the glass shower partition, and the balcony door which would need child-proofing; the unit is completely empty so furniture choices can be baby-safe from the start. Being on the 8th floor of a 10-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
