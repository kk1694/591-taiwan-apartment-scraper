{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment on 12F with designer finishes, light wood flooring, built-in glass wardrobes, kitchen island bar, and excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with city views. The glass door partitions and sharp-cornered coffee table/bar counter are baby safety concerns; the balcony visible in image 3 has a washing machine but railing safety should be verified in person. Very clean and well-maintained, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request full details directly."}
