{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with high-quality finishes including wood-panel accent walls, recessed lighting, wood laminate flooring, a fully equipped kitchen with Rinnai gas cooktop and built-in dish dryer, and a bathroom with a smart toilet and bathtub. The living room has large sliding glass doors providing good natural light. For baby safety, the floor-to-ceiling windows need childproof locks, and kitchen knives are stored on an open rack that should be relocated; otherwise the flat layout with no stairs is baby-friendly. At 36 ping on the 5th floor of a 16-story building, it very likely has an elevator and offers generous space for a growing family."}
