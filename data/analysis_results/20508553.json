{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Ren'ai Road Section 4, Lane 300, near Guofu Memorial Hall MRT (462m)", "notes": "Full-floor unit in elevator building, good for stroller access. Includes balcony for natural light, allows pets and cooking. At 10 ping (33 sqm) it's compact for a family with a baby. Cannot assess modernity or baby safety features (railings, sharp corners) without seeing actual interior photos."}
