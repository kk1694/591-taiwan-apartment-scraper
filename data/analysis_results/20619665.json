{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Beautifully designed open-plan apartment with a bohemian/natural aesthetic, featuring hardwood floors, designer lighting, abundant indoor plants, and a stylish green kitchen island. The space is very well-maintained and appears to be professionally decorated. For baby safety, the open-plan layout with a bed area separated only by curtains, numerous hanging plants within reach, small decorative objects on open shelving, and the kitchen island with hard corners are concerns; however the flat layout with no stairs and large windows providing good natural light are positives. Being on the 14th floor of a 14-floor building strongly suggests elevator access, but the top-floor location may mean more heat exposure in summer."}
