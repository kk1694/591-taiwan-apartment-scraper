{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with clean modern finishes including light wood cabinetry, recessed LED lighting, vinyl plank flooring, and split AC units. The open layout is spacious at 34 ping with generous built-in storage; the kitchen has a gas stove and the bathroom appears modern. For baby safety, the open shelving units have sharp corners that would need padding, and the window railings visible from outside appear to be older-style iron grilles which should be checked for spacing; overall the flat floors and lack of stairs are positive for a crawling child."}
