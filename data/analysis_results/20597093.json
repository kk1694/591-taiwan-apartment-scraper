{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious, modern apartment on 9F of a 19-story building with recessed lighting, polished marble floors, and a large open living area with floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors to a balcony. The balcony has metal railings that appear adequately high but the sliding doors would need child-locks once the baby becomes mobile. Bedroom has hardwood flooring, new mattress, AC, and a generous walk-in closet with built-in organizers. The unit appears very clean and move-in ready, with excellent natural light from multiple windows; however, only 5 photos were provided and no kitchen or bathroom is shown, which is a minor red flag worth investigating."}
