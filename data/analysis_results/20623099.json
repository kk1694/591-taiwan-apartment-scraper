{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-renovated apartment with modern white cabinetry, polished tile floors, stylish lighting fixtures, and built-in TV unit. The open layout is clean and bright with decent natural light from windows with security grilles. For baby safety, the flat single-level layout is good, but the open cubby shelving units could tip if climbed on and the metal-framed dining chairs have sharp edges; no balcony or stairs visible which is a plus. Note: the listing description is essentially empty (just a generic 591 promo message), which is a minor red flag — request more details from the agent about bedrooms, kitchen, and bathroom condition."}
