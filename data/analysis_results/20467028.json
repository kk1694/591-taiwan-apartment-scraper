{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment on 1F of a 5-story walk-up with dated rattan furniture, old wooden cabinets, and basic fixtures. The space is spacious at 35 ping with clean tile floors, but furnishings are worn and the overall feel is dated. For baby safety, the exposed cables near the TV stand, glass-topped rattan table, and metal dining chairs with thin legs are tipping hazards; being on the 1st floor is convenient but natural light appears limited based on the small window/sliding door area visible in the living room."}
