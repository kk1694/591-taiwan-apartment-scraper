{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, spacious apartment with contemporary finishes including polished concrete floors, wood accent walls, and stylish lighting fixtures. The unit has good natural light from large windows overlooking greenery. Baby safety concerns: balcony has standard metal railings that would need child-proofing, and concrete floors are hard surfaces. Being on 5F/5F (top floor) with no elevator indication may be challenging for parents with a stroller."}
