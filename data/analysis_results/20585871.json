{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Modern open-plan studio with dark industrial-chic design, dark ceiling tiles, recessed lighting, laminate wood flooring, digital door lock, small kitchenette, and a balcony with sliding glass doors. The space is stylish but is a single open room (studio layout) which may feel cramped for a couple with a baby at 12 ping. Baby safety concerns include the balcony access with sliding glass doors on a high floor (14F), and the overall dark ambiance with limited natural light due to dark walls and ceiling. The unit appears clean and new but the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag—verify actual amenities and lease terms directly."}
