{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern light wood flooring, fresh white walls, and multiple split AC units. The unit appears to be a 3-bedroom layout with good natural light from large balcony doors and windows with security grilles. Baby safety considerations: the balcony has proper railings, window grilles provide security, no visible stairs within unit, and rounded ceiling beams present minimal hazard. Top floor (5F/5F) may lack elevator which could be challenging with a stroller."}
