{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment with marble-look flooring, recessed lighting, built-in wood cabinetry, and modern AC units. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and the glass dining table are baby safety concerns that would need corner guards. The large windows provide good natural light, and the apartment appears very clean and spacious at 30.7 ping. Being on the 10th floor of a 12-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Listed by a Japanese real estate agency (奧村不動產), which may indicate foreigner-friendly rental terms."}
