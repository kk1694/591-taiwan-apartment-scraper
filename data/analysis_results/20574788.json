{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Exceptionally modern and spacious unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, central AC, sleek dark kitchen cabinets with built-in oven, and large sliding glass doors to a balcony. The flat layout with no stairs and smooth tile/wood flooring is very baby-friendly, though the balcony sliding doors will need child locks once the baby is mobile. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), the unit is very clean and move-in ready, with good natural light from large windows; at 63 ping this is a generous family-sized space ideal for a couple expecting a baby."}
