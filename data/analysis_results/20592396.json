{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern upscale apartment in a tall granite-clad building with elevator (12-story building, unit on 11F). Interior features high-end finishes including black marble accent walls, crystal chandeliers, glossy tile floors, modern kitchen with gas stove, dishwasher, and built-in cabinets. There is a balcony visible from the kitchen with glass sliding doors and metal railings—baby safety would need attention around the balcony access and the sharp-edged marble/glass surfaces. Good natural light from high floor with open city views; the unit appears clean and well-maintained but the dark color scheme and reflective surfaces may need baby-proofing."}
