{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including curved LED ceiling lighting, marble-look tile flooring, and quality leather furniture. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with views of greenery. For baby safety, the balcony has full-height glass sliding doors that appear secure; corners are mostly rounded and the open floor plan minimizes hazards, though the glass TV console shelf would need childproofing. Very clean and well-maintained condition."}
