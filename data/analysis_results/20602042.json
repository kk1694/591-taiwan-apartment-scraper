{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment with dated interior from the 1990s-2000s era, featuring decorative ceiling panels and dark hardwood floors throughout. The unit is clean and well-maintained with ample built-in storage, but the bathroom shows its age with older fixtures. For baby safety, the open floor plan is positive but the small balcony visible near the dining area and the low window seats in the living room would need attention; no stairs present which is good."}
