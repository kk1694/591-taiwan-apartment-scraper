{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with polished hardwood floors, recessed lighting, and contemporary built-in cabinetry with designer wall panels. The unit appears to have multiple rooms and good natural light from large windows in the main living area. For baby safety, the hardwood floors are smooth and easy to clean but slippery; the angular built-in furniture feature has sharp diagonal edges that would need corner guards. No kitchen, bathroom, or balcony photos were provided, so those areas cannot be assessed. The listing is unfurnished and through a real estate agent (Chang-Sheng Real Estate), and the description is minimal — a red flag suggesting this may be a placeholder or advertisement-driven listing rather than a detailed rental posting."}
