{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern, well-renovated studio apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). The unit is very clean with new white cabinetry, stainless steel fridge, washer/dryer, microwave, AC, and a murphy-style bed that folds into the wall. However, at only 11 ping it is a single open-room studio which will be extremely cramped for a couple with a baby — there is no separate bedroom and the kitchen/living/sleeping area are all one space. Natural light comes from windows at the far end but appears limited; the bathroom is compact with a glass sliding door. No significant baby safety hazards like exposed stairs or dangerous balconies are visible, but the tight space itself is the main concern."}
