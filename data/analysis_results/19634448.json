{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end minimalist finishes including recessed LED lighting, light wood laminate flooring, built-in storage cabinets, wall-mounted AC, and an open-plan kitchen with modern cabinetry. The spacious open layout with no visible stairs and smooth rounded furniture edges is relatively baby-friendly, though the low TV console LED strip lighting and exposed cables near the TV wall would need childproofing. No windows or balconies are visible in the photos, which raises questions about natural light ventilation; the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag."}
