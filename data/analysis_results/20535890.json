{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near a park with bike-sharing station", "notes": "This is an older building (appears 30+ years old) with a staffed lobby and two elevators. No interior photos of the actual unit are provided - only building exterior, lobby, elevator area, and unit entrance door. The building lobby is well-maintained with a concierge desk. Cannot assess baby safety, natural light, or apartment condition without interior photos. Red flag: complete lack of interior images makes it impossible to evaluate living space quality for the high NT$82,500 rent."}
