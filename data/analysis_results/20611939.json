{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/office space rather than a residential apartment — it has drop ceiling with fluorescent panel lighting, bare white walls with black baseboards, and a metal security door typical of ground-floor commercial units. The space is completely unfurnished and empty with no kitchen or residential fixtures visible. Not suitable for a family with a baby: the 1F location in an older walk-up building, iron-barred windows, and commercial layout make this a poor choice for residential living. The listing description is also just a generic agent advertisement with no real property details, which is a red flag."}
