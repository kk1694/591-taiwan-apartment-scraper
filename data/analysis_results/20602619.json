{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, renovated apartment with modern white tile flooring, recessed lighting, built-in cabinets, and wall-mounted AC units. Good natural light from large windows in the bedroom. For baby safety: the raised window bay/platform could be a climbing hazard, and the hard tile floors throughout may need area rugs for cushioning. No visible balcony railings or stairs to evaluate."}
