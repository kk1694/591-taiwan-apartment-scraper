{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "政大里 (Zhengda Li area)", "notes": "This is a spacious older-style apartment with dated fixtures including traditional wood paneling, ornate ceiling details, and aging AC units. The unit is clean but has a 1990s aesthetic. Baby safety concerns include an accessible balcony with standard railings visible in image 2, and the glass cabinet in the dining area. Natural light is good with multiple windows. Being on 4F/4F (top floor) with no visible elevator, climbing stairs with a baby/stroller could be challenging."}
