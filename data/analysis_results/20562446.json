{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with clean finishes, track lighting, wood-look laminate flooring, and contemporary furniture. The space appears very clean with minimalist design; however the bedroom shown has only a single bed which may be tight for a couple. For baby safety, the space has no visible stairs or balconies in the photos, and corners appear rounded on most furniture, though the metal clothing rack has some sharp edges to consider."}
