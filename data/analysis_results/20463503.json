{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with bright white tiled floors, updated kitchen with range hood and water filter, and at least two bedrooms (one with a desk that could serve as a nursery). The unit is on 10F/14F in a modern building that almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the floors are smooth tile with no stairs visible, sliding room dividers have no sharp edges, and windows appear to have secure frames; however, the low coffee table corners and the kitchen area would need baby-proofing once the child is mobile."}
