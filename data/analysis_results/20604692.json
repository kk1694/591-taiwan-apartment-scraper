{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained modern apartment with recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, and quality furnishings across a large living area and at least two bedrooms. The floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding glass balcony doors provide excellent natural light but the balcony access in bedrooms is a safety concern for a crawling baby—railings appear adequate but the sliding doors would need child locks. The hard tile floors throughout are very clean but slippery and unforgiving for a toddler; area rugs would be advisable. At 6F/10F in a modern high-rise building in Zhongshan, an elevator is almost certainly present. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag—request full details on layout, lease terms, and whether the listed price includes management fees."}
