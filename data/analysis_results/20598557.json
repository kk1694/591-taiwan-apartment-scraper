{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including window AC units, traditional wooden furniture, and tile flooring throughout. The walls show some wear and discoloration. For baby safety, the balcony has sliding glass doors that need child locks, and the heavy wooden furniture has sharp corners that would need padding. Natural light is decent from multiple windows but limited by window bars. Clean but visibly aged condition overall."}
