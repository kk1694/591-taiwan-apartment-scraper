{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern, well-furnished apartment with contemporary finishes including recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and a video intercom system suggesting a newer high-rise building. Good natural light in the bedroom with large windows. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp metal edges and the low TV stand would need attention; no visible balcony railings or stairs to worry about. Overall very clean condition with quality furnishings."}
