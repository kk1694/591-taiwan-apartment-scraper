{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with high-end marble-look tile flooring, recessed LED lighting, split AC units, and marble accent walls. The unit is completely unfurnished and appears brand new with clean white finishes and elegant paneling in bedrooms. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery and the balcony sliding doors should be checked for secure locks; no stairs visible which is good for a 1F unit. The listing description is minimal (just an agent promotion message), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout, kitchen, and bathroom before committing at NT$70,000/month."}
