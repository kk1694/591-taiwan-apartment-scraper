{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in a high-rise (16F/24F) with sleek built-in wood-tone cabinetry, recessed lighting, polished tile floors, a separate enclosed kitchen with built-in oven and gas stove, and good natural light from large windows with mountain views. The unit is unfurnished and very clean with no visible stairs; the open layout with smooth floors and rounded cabinet edges is relatively baby-safe, though the large windows on a high floor would need child-proof locks. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), but the images show a high-quality, well-maintained unit that would suit a family well."}
