{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including traditional carved wooden front door, old-style wooden furniture, and drop ceiling tiles, though the laminate flooring and white walls appear clean. The spacious living area is mostly unfurnished with sliding glass balcony doors that would need child-proofing locks; the bedroom has AC and a basic bed. Natural light appears limited as photos were taken at night with frosted/barred windows, and the description is minimal (just agent advertising), which is a red flag — no kitchen or bathroom photos are shown, raising concerns about their condition. At 3F with no elevator visible, carrying a stroller up stairs daily would be inconvenient."}
