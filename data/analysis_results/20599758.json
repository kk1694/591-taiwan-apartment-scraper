{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and stylish loft-style apartment with high ceilings, contemporary fixtures, induction cooktop, washing machine, fridge, and clean minimalist design. Major baby safety concern: the unit has a loft/mezzanine sleeping area accessed by a steep metal ladder, which is dangerous for a pregnant woman and completely unsafe for a toddler. The floor-to-ceiling windows appear secure, but the narrow elongated layout and ladder-accessed loft make this poorly suited for a family with a baby."}
