{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated wooden cabinetry, tile flooring, and a basic kitchen with gas stove and white tile backsplash showing some age. The unit is spacious at 47 ping with at least two bedrooms, built-in wardrobes, an en-suite bathroom, a separate laundry area with washing machine and gas water heater, and decent natural light from enclosed balcony windows. For baby safety, the raised wooden platform area between living room and balcony could be a tripping hazard, and the open kitchen counter partition has sharp corners that would need padding; the overall condition is clean but clearly not renovated, giving it a 1990s-era feel."}
