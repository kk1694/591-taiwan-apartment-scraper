{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment (42 ping) in Da'an with recently renovated floors and fresh paint, but older-style kitchen with exposed exhaust pipe, basic gas stove, and dated cabinetry; exposed conduit on ceilings gives an unfinished feel. Being on the 5th floor of a 6-story walk-up building (almost certainly no elevator), carrying a baby and stroller up daily would be a significant concern; the balcony has sliding glass doors with railings visible but the open kitchen layout and lack of furnished state means you'd need to baby-proof extensively. Natural light appears moderate from the front windows but overall the space feels somewhat dim, and at NT$75,000/month for an unfurnished older walk-up, the value is questionable."}
