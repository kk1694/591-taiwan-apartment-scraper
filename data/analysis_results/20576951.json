{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex-style apartment with clean white interiors, updated kitchen appliances, and split AC units. Major baby safety concern: the internal spiral staircase has no visible railings or gates, posing a significant fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler. The unit is clean with decent natural light through multiple windows, but the loft/mezzanine area with open stairs would require childproofing."}
