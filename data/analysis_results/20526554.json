{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial or industrial space rather than a residential apartment. The interior shows bare concrete floors with stains/damage, empty warehouse-like rooms, and a very basic tiled kitchen with exposed pipes that looks more suited for commercial food preparation. The space is in poor condition, not suitable for a family with a baby due to the rough unfinished floors, lack of proper residential amenities, and overall industrial character. The exterior photos show nearby modern high-rise buildings but this listing itself appears to be in an older low-rise structure."}
