{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated parquet wood flooring and window-unit AC throughout multiple spacious rooms. The unit is very large at 73.5 ping with built-in wooden wardrobes and clean white walls, but fixtures are clearly from the 1980s-90s era. Natural light appears limited with small windows and security grilles; one room has a balcony door with iron bars. For baby safety, the hard parquet floors could be slippery, and the balcony access would need childproofing, but the rooms are spacious with no stairs visible. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — no details on layout, kitchen, or bathrooms despite the high NT$95,000 price."}
