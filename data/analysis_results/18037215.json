{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with sleek white cabinetry, track lighting, induction cooktop, split AC units, and contemporary furniture. The unit is clean and in excellent condition with smooth tile flooring throughout, which is easy to clean but can be slippery for a crawling baby. There is a balcony visible with sliding glass doors from the living room — railing height and safety should be verified in person. The kitchen has sharp-cornered countertops and the glass coffee table in the living room would need baby-proofing. Listed through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency, a foreigner-friendly agency, which is a plus. Natural light appears moderate, with windows in the bedroom and living room, though the bedroom window faces a narrow gap between buildings. At 26 ping for NT$54,000/month in Zhongzheng, this is reasonably priced for such a well-finished unit. No bedroom count is confirmed from these images but at least one bedroom and one bathroom are visible."}
