{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment on 12F with polished tile flooring in living area and wood/laminate in bedrooms. At least 3 rooms visible with large windows providing excellent natural light and city/mountain views. The unit is very clean and in good condition with recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and an en-suite bathroom visible in the master bedroom. Baby safety concerns include a balcony accessible via sliding doors in the living room that would need childproofing, and sharp corners on the glass/stone TV console and coffee table. The large open floor plan and floor-to-ceiling windows on the 12th floor are a concern once baby is mobile - window locks should be verified."}
