{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with contemporary finishes including recessed lighting, sleek built-in cabinetry, wall-mounted AC, and a dark glass TV feature wall. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. For baby safety: the balcony has glass panel railings which should be checked for gaps, and the hard tile flooring would benefit from rugs. The space appears very clean with no visible hazards or red flags."}
