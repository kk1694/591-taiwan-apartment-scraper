{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "High-end, beautifully renovated apartment with designer finishes including green marble countertops, modern Panasonic washer/dryer, recessed LED lighting, and sleek cabinetry. Listed by Elegant Realty (expat housing agency). The open kitchen with bar-height stools and sharp marble counter edges is a baby safety concern; the glass partition panels between living and bedroom areas could also be a hazard. Being on 10F/10F (top floor) may mean roof heat issues in summer, but the unit appears very clean with good natural light through large windows with honeycomb blinds."}
