{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with contemporary furniture including L-shaped sofa, wooden dining set, and split AC units. The space is well-lit with recessed lighting and has a balcony visible through vertical slat dividers. For baby safety, the coffee table has rounded edges but the vertical slat room divider could pose climbing risks; the balcony railings should be verified in person. Being on the 6th floor of a 19-floor building strongly suggests elevator access."}
