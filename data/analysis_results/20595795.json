{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, bright apartment in excellent condition with contemporary fixtures, LED lighting, split AC units, and high-gloss tile flooring. The space features a spacious open-plan living area, glass-partitioned kitchen, and at least two bedrooms with large windows providing abundant natural light. For baby safety, the windows appear to be floor-to-ceiling in some areas with balcony access in the living room - ensure proper childproofing; floors are hard tile which may need rugs for a crawling baby. No visible stairs or dangerous features; overall very clean and well-maintained."}
