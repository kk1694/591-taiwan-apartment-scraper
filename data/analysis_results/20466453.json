{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "High-end modern apartment with luxury finishes including marble-look tile flooring, recessed LED ceiling lighting, built-in cabinetry with soft-close drawers, ceiling-mounted AC, and a stylish bathroom with stone-look wall tiles and vessel sink. The unit is unfurnished with clean open spaces and good natural light from balcony glass doors. For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery, the balcony needs childproofing, and the open wardrobe shelving has accessible sharp edges; however the overall layout is single-level with no stairs, which is a plus. Being on 2F of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
