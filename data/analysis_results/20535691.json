{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is a ground-floor commercial/storefront space in an older Zhongshan walk-up building, not a residential apartment. The space is completely empty and appears to be mid-renovation with exposed wires, unfinished concrete walls, dangling cables, and no kitchen or bathroom visible. The large glass storefront door opens directly to the street with scooters parked outside, confirming its commercial nature. Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby — no residential layout, no separation from the street, exposed electrical wiring posing serious safety hazards, and very limited natural light relying on fluorescent ceiling panels."}
