{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "This is a modern duplex/loft-style apartment with high ceilings, a mezzanine level accessed by a curved staircase with glass railing, clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, and a well-equipped kitchen with washing machine. Major baby safety concern: the internal staircase to the mezzanine with glass balustrade poses a significant fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler, and the glass coffee table has sharp edges. The apartment is clean and bright with city views from the 10th floor, but the loft layout is not ideal for a family with an infant."}
