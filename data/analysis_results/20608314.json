{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very spacious unfurnished apartment (47.8 ping) with classic parquet wood flooring and freshly painted white walls. The unit is on the 12th floor of a 20-story building, suggesting elevator access, and has good natural light from multiple windows with a small enclosed balcony. For baby safety, the open layout with no stairs is positive, but the balcony area with metal security grilles needs inspection; the apartment is completely empty so furnishing choices can be baby-proofed from scratch. The listing description is essentially a real estate agent advertisement placeholder with minimal useful info, which is a minor red flag — request more details on kitchen, bathrooms, and lease terms."}
