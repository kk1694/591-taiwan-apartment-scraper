{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale modern apartment with high-end finishes including decorative ceiling moldings, polished marble/tile floors, and a raised platform area with wood flooring. The spacious open layout is very clean with good natural light from windows. For baby safety, the raised platform edge and hard tile floors are concerns; the open kitchen with glass partitions appears safe but would need childproofing. Building on 10th floor of 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
