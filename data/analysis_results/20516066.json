{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated apartment with modern fixtures, clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, digital door lock, AC, washing machine, and new IKEA-style furniture still in packaging. The unit appears to be a 2-room layout with a living area, kitchen, and bedroom; natural light is limited as the living room has a glass block window and the bedroom window faces close neighboring buildings with tall plants obstructing the view. For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery, the raised platform shelving area in the living room has sharp edges, and the exposed electrical panels (DD panel/breaker boxes) on the wall should be child-proofed; however there are no visible balconies or dangerous railings, which is a plus."}
