{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated studio apartment in excellent condition with clean minimalist design, light wood flooring, built-in storage bed, built-in wardrobe, desk area, and a well-equipped kitchenette with brand-name appliances (Panasonic washer-dryer, Toshiba fridge, microwave, induction cooktop, dishwasher). Good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the space is fairly open with no stairs, but the studio layout at 12 ping is quite compact for a couple with a baby and offers no separate room for a nursery. No visible balcony railings to worry about but limited space overall."}
