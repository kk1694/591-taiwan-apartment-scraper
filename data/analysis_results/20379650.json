{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with modern recessed lighting, clean granite/terrazzo floors, and multiple bedrooms with good natural light from large windows. The living room has a balcony with adequate railing height, though the glass coffee table corners could be a concern for a crawling baby. At 71.8 ping on the 5th floor of a 14-story building (very likely has elevator), this is a generous family-sized unit in clean condition with no major red flags, though the polished stone floors may be slippery for toddlers."}
