{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious and upscale apartment with modern recessed and cove lighting, polished hardwood flooring, large panoramic windows providing excellent natural light, and a stone accent wall at the entryway. The living area is very large at 63 ping with clean, well-maintained finishes and a leather sectional sofa. For baby safety, the raised platform step between the wood and tile flooring zones is a trip/fall hazard that would need padding, and the large low windows should be checked for secure locks; the glass coffee table also has sharp corners worth covering. Being on the 15th floor of an 18-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator, and the high floor provides good ventilation and views."}
