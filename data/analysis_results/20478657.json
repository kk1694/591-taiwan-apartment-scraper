{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with light wood flooring, wall-mounted AC units, and updated fixtures throughout. The unit appears very clean with minimal furniture - includes a single bed frame and kitchenette with induction cooktop and marble countertop. For baby safety, the space looks flat and single-level with no visible stairs or balcony hazards; however, natural light appears limited as all windows are covered with blackout curtains, and the kitchen area is open with accessible low cabinets that would need childproofing."}
