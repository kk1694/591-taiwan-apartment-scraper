{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a 2-story standalone house or townhouse in Shilin with a narrow entrance corridor and a metal gate. The exterior shows older construction with pebble-wash walls, and the interior window views reveal a corrugated metal roofing structure above with visible rust/aging. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), and no interior living space photos are provided — a major red flag. For a couple expecting a baby, concerns include the lack of interior photos making it impossible to assess baby safety (stairs between floors, sharp corners, railings), and the 2F/2F layout means stairs will be required with no elevator, which is difficult with a stroller and infant. At NT$85,000/month it is expensive for what appears to be an older property with minimal information."}
