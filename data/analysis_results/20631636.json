{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Songjiang Road, Zhongshan District, near Songjiang Nanjing MRT", "notes": "Newly renovated luxury 2BR/2BA apartment on Songjiang Road near MRT Songjiang-Nanjing station. Well-furnished with full appliances, natural gas cooking allowed, and includes a balcony. Major concern: listed as a top-floor addition (頂加/rooftop addition on 5F), which means it may be an informal structure added on the roof - these can have heat issues in summer, potential waterproofing problems, and may not be fully legal. For a baby, the balcony railings should be inspected carefully, and the rooftop addition status raises safety questions worth investigating in person. No pets allowed; cooking is permitted which is good for a family."}
