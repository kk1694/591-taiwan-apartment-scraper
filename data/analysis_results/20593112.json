{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near a school with track field, Taipei 101 visible from window, Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained modern apartment with recessed lighting, split AC units, and large tile flooring. The living room is bright with a large balcony providing excellent natural light and views of a school sports field and Taipei 101. For baby safety, the balcony access and glass doors require childproofing; coffee table has sharp corners. The 10th floor location and modern building (12 floors) strongly suggests elevator access. Overall clean condition with minimal furniture, good for a growing family."}
