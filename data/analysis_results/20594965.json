{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, clean unfurnished apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, AC units, and a well-equipped kitchen with gas stove and range hood. The balcony has proper brick railings which is good for baby safety, though floor-to-ceiling glass doors need child locks. Good natural light from multiple windows, though some rooms have smaller windows. At 15F in a 16F building, elevator is almost certain."}
