{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, newly built apartment in a high-rise building (9F/19F) with clean hallways, digital intercom, and hardwood flooring throughout. The unit is completely unfurnished/empty with exposed ceiling pipes and no light fixtures installed, suggesting it is a bare shell requiring full furnishing. Good natural light from black-framed windows in multiple rooms; no visible balcony railings or dangerous features, but the unit needs significant setup (kitchen, bathroom not shown) before being livable — verify if kitchen/bathroom are included. Very spacious at ~55 ping with at least 2-3 rooms, suitable for a family with a baby once furnished."}
