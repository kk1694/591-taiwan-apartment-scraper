{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with modern built-in cabinetry, crystal chandelier, large flat-screen TV, decorative wallpaper, and a fully equipped L-shaped kitchen with gas stove, range hood, microwave, and ample counter space. The 13-story building on 4F almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout are slippery, the small dining counter with rolling office chair could be a tipping hazard, and the kitchen cabinets lack child locks; however, the space appears clean, well-maintained, and has decent natural light from windows visible in the living room area."}
