{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern, newly renovated apartment with high-quality finishes including marble accents, built-in cabinetry, and recessed lighting. The unit appears very clean with smooth tile floors and no visible hazards for a baby. Being on the 15th floor of a 15-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator. Good natural light from large windows with proper safety glass; no visible balconies or stairs, which is positive for baby safety."}
