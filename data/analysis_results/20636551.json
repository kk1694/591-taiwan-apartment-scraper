{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment with elegant European-style interior design featuring white leather sofas, marble coffee table, crystal chandelier, built-in TV cabinet, recessed LED lighting, and polished tile floors. The space appears very clean and spacious at 34.7 ping. For baby safety, the marble coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need padding, and the glossy tile floors could be slippery; no stairs visible and the flat layout is good. Only living/dining area photos are shown — no kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom views available, which is a red flag — and the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), so further inquiry is strongly recommended before committing."}
