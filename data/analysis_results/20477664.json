{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older building (appears 1980s-90s era) with internal staircase to upper loft level - a safety concern for a baby due to steep wooden stairs with open railings. The apartment is spacious with high ceilings and skylights providing natural light, but fixtures and finishes are dated. Being on 6F/6F in an older low-rise building strongly suggests no elevator, which would be challenging with a stroller and baby gear."}
