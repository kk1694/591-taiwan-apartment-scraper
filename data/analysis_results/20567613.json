{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious older villa-style home (3F/3F suggests no elevator in a low-rise building) with traditional Taiwanese decor including heavy wood furniture and classic fixtures. The living spaces are clean with good recessed lighting but dated design. For baby safety, the low coffee table has sharp corners, there appear to be stairs (multi-floor unit), and the windows have security bars which could be both safe and a fire hazard; the open kitchen layout with step-down may also pose risks for crawling babies."}
