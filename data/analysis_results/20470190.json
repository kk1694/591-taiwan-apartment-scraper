{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Exceptionally modern studio apartment with high-end finishes, built-in appliances including wine cooler and oven, sleek integrated kitchen, and designer lighting. For baby safety, the space has rounded furniture edges and no visible balcony railings or stairs, but the open floor plan and low platform bed may need childproofing. The space is very clean with good recessed lighting though natural light appears limited based on the visible windows."}
