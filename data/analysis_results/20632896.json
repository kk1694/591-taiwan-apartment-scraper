{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern duplex-style apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, contemporary kitchen with island sink, and wall-mounted TV. Major baby safety concern: the unit has an internal staircase with glass railings leading to an upper level, which would require baby gates and careful supervision. The hard tile floors throughout are slippery and unforgiving for falls. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with security grilles. The unit appears brand new or recently renovated, very clean, and the 13-story building on the 6th floor almost certainly has an elevator."}
