{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern unfurnished apartment with freshly painted white walls, polished tile floors, modern wood-grain doors, and wall-mounted AC. The unit appears newly renovated or nearly new with a spacious 3-bedroom layout suitable for a family. The bedroom window has a sliding window without visible balcony railing concerns, but the listing mentions 2 balconies which should be inspected for child safety; the completely empty unfurnished state means you would need to buy all furniture, but also means no sharp corners or hazards currently present. Natural light appears moderate from the bedroom window photo."}
