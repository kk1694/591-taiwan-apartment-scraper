{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Dated 1990s-style apartment with older fixtures, crystal chandeliers, and wood-toned cabinetry throughout. Spacious layout with large living room, dining area, galley kitchen, and bedroom with built-in wardrobes. For baby safety, the balcony visible in image 2 has metal railings that would need childproofing, and the coffee table has sharp metal corners. Good natural light from windows but the overall decor and appliances appear aged."}
