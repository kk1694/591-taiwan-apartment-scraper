{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment with elegant European-style finishes, crystal chandelier, recessed lighting, and high-quality leather furniture. The unit appears very clean with polished tile floors and good natural light from large arched windows. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need padding, and there appears to be a balcony visible through the windows that would require childproofing verification."}
