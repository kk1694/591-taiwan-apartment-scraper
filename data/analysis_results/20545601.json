{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with high-end finishes including wood panel accent wall, recessed LED lighting, floor-to-ceiling windows, and built-in cabinetry. Excellent natural light from large balcony windows. Baby safety concerns: the balcony has metal railings that appear baby-safe but the low window ledge and open shelving may need childproofing. Clean and move-in ready condition with modern kitchen appliances."}
