{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end renovation with recessed LED lighting, engineered hardwood floors, built-in cabinetry, central AC, and a sleek open kitchen with breakfast bar. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency with Japanese services). The apartment is clean and in excellent condition with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the built-in cat wall shelves on the TV unit have sharp edges and are climbable, and the bar stools with thin metal legs could be a tipping hazard. No visible balcony access in these photos, which is a plus for child safety. At 32 ping on the 8th floor of a 10-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator."}
