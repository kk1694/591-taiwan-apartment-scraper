{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Luxury modern apartment in excellent condition with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, marble-look flooring, leather sofa, and built-in cabinetry. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreign-friendly rental agency). The coffee table has sharp glass corners that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony sliding doors on the 9th floor require child locks; the large open living space with smooth tile floors is otherwise very baby-friendly. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows in both living room and bedroom, and the unit is very clean and well-maintained with no visible red flags."}
