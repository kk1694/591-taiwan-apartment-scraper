{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated furniture and fixtures from the 1990s-2000s era; hardwood floors are well-maintained but cabinets and appliances show their age. The spacious layout is good for a family but the kitchen area leads to a small balcony/utility space that may need baby-proofing, and the marble coffee table and wooden furniture have sharp corners. Good natural light from multiple windows, reasonably clean condition overall."}
