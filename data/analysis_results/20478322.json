{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated studio apartment with light wood flooring, recessed lighting, and stylish concrete accent wall. Open-plan layout with kitchen, living, and sleeping areas combined. Clean and bright with multiple windows providing natural light. For baby safety: the open floor plan has minimal sharp corners but the glass-enclosed bathroom may need a lock; no visible balcony railings to worry about in photos."}
