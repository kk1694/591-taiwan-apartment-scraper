{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Near FamilyMart and Taiwan Pingtung Development Association, Neihu District", "notes": "All 5 images show only exterior street views of the neighborhood - no interior photos of the apartment are provided. The building appears to be a typical Taiwan high-rise (8+ floors visible) which likely has an elevator. The area has convenient amenities (FamilyMart, shops nearby) but without interior photos, cannot assess condition, baby safety features, natural light, or cleanliness. This is a significant red flag - the listing shows no actual apartment photos despite being a 77.4 ping unit at NT$48,000/month."}
