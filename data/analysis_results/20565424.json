{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with brand new renovation featuring recessed LED cove lighting, polished tile floors, sleek built-in cabinetry, and a stylish open-plan kitchen with dark cabinets and marble-top dining table. Managed by UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a foreigner-friendly rental agency with Japanese service. The space is spacious at 47.6 ping with large windows providing good natural light and greenery views. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery, and the low TV unit and open kitchen area would need childproofing; no visible balcony railings or stairs in these images. The apartment appears move-in ready with AC units installed, though a delivery box suggests it may still be in final setup."}
