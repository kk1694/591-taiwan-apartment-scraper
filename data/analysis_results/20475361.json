{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with clean finishes, light wood flooring, split AC units, and built-in storage. Has internal stairs to a loft/mezzanine area which is a significant baby safety concern - stairs appear steep with no gate visible. The unit has good natural light from multiple windows, appears very clean and well-maintained. Kitchen is compact but functional with a small balcony access."}
