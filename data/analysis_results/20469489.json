{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is clearly a commercial/retail storefront space with large glass doors at street level, not a residential apartment. The space is empty with fluorescent lighting, tiled floors, and appears to be designed for retail or office use. Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby - no kitchen, no bathroom facilities visible, industrial-style lighting, and ground-floor street access poses security concerns."}
