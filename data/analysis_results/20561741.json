{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with sleek black-framed glass partitions, recessed lighting, white glossy tile floors, and contemporary furnishings. The kitchen features a glass backsplash, gas cooktop, and modern cabinetry. The building appears to be a newer 14-floor high-rise (5F) which almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the metal coffee tables have sharp edges that would need corner guards, and the kitchen door opens to a small balcony area with railings visible through the window; the small study/second room could work as a nursery. Good natural light from multiple windows with views of surrounding residential buildings. Very clean and well-maintained overall."}
