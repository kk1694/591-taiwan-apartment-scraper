{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylishly renovated apartment with sleek white kitchen, track lighting, polished tile floors, and contemporary furnishings. Being on floor 21 of 23, it certainly has an elevator. The open layout appears clean and well-maintained with good natural light from balcony windows. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and minimal visible railings are worth noting, though no obvious hazards like exposed sharp corners or unsafe balcony gaps are visible."}
