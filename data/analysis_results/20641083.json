{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment in excellent condition with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, central AC, and large built-in wardrobes. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to balconies. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners and balcony doors would need child locks; the floors are hard tile so crawling babies may need mats."}
