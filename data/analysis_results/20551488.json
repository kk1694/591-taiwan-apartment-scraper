{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated hardwood floors showing wear and some debris/trash left behind, suggesting it is between tenants and needs cleaning. The kitchen has been updated with white cabinets and gas stove but the building style is clearly older (window-unit AC, tile flooring in bedroom, traditional layout). For baby safety, the balcony area visible through sliding doors in the living room would need checking for railing gaps, and the hardwood floors appear slippery; the unit has good natural light from multiple windows. The unfurnished, empty state and messy condition raise concerns about maintenance standards."}
