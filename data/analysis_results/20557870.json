{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious luxury apartment in excellent condition with high-end finishes including marble floors, recessed lighting, modern white kitchen, and large walk-in closet. The living room has a balcony with glass railings visible; for baby safety, the balcony access and hard marble/tile floors would need attention. Good natural light from large windows, very clean, and the 9th floor location in a 12-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
