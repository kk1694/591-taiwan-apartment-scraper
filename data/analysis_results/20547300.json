{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Mixed condition apartment in Da'an — one room has been partially renovated with light wood laminate flooring and modern curtains, but other rooms show older finishes including a window-unit AC, slightly worn walls, and dated built-in wardrobes. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at 44 ping with multiple rooms, but no kitchen or bathroom photos were provided, which is a red flag. For baby safety, the flat floors with no stairs are good, but the low window sills in several rooms would need guards or locks; some wall-mounted outlets are also at low height. Natural light is moderate, partially blocked by neighboring buildings."}
