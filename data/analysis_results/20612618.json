{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with clean white finishes, built-in cabinetry, and good natural light from large windows with mountain views. The open-plan living area has smooth tile floors and no visible stairs, but the coffee table has sharp corners and the balcony visible through windows would need baby-proofing. Being on the 7th floor of a 19-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
