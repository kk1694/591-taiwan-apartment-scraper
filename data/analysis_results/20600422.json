{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Mingshui Road (明水路)", "notes": "Very modern apartment in excellent condition with contemporary finishes, recessed lighting, split AC units, and sleek built-in cabinetry. The building appears to be a newer high-rise (9 floors) with elevator access. Good natural light from windows. For baby safety, the interior has smooth tile floors and no visible stairs, but the balcony (visible through glass door) would need childproofing. Overall a clean, upscale unit suitable for a family."}
