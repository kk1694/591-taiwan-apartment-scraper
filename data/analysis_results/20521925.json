{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including wood-panel accents, recessed LED lighting, split AC units, and a stylish open kitchen with built-in appliances. The raised bedroom platform with glass sliding doors is a notable baby safety concern as the step-up edge could cause trips and falls; the glass panels themselves would also need childproofing. The unit is unfurnished, spacious at 33 ping, very clean, and appears to have limited natural light based on the photos — no windows are visible, which is a red flag worth verifying in person."}
