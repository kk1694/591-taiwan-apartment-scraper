{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, central AC, light wood cabinetry, and bright white tile floors. Managed by UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly agency). The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony has sliding glass doors that open to a railed balcony on the 8th floor — verify railing height and gaps. The unit appears to be a well-furnished 1-2 bedroom with good natural light from the balcony side, though some photos suggest the view may be partially blocked by adjacent buildings."}
