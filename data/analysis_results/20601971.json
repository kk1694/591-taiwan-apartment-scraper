{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed LED lighting, hardwood and tile flooring, stone accent walls, and a stylish Japanese-style tatami room with raised platform and bamboo decor. The spacious living areas have large windows providing good natural light and city views from the 15th floor. Baby safety concerns include the raised tatami platform with steps (fall risk for crawling baby), large glass sliding doors, and the high floor with large windows that would need child-proofing. The listing description is minimal (just a promotional blurb), which is a minor red flag — request more details from the An-Ho Real Estate agent on layout and amenities."}
