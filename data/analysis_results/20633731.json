The building appears to be a standard walk-up without elevator (common for this era), but cannot confirm. No interior photos to assess condition, baby safety features, or modernity. The unit is on the top floor (7F/7F) which is a concern if no elevator exists. The description is just a promotional message with no actual apartment details."}
