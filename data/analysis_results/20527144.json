{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, newly renovated apartment with modern white tile flooring, split AC units, and contemporary fixtures including a modern kitchen and bathroom. The space appears very clean with minimal furnishing. For baby safety: no visible balcony railings to assess, flat single-level layout is good, but the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from rugs or mats. Limited natural light visible in photos - windows appear to have heavy curtains drawn."}
