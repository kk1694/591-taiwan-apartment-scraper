{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment in clean but dated condition with older-style tile floors, dark wood baseboards, and basic ceiling light fixtures. The unit is very spacious at 46 ping with multiple rooms, good natural light from several windows with security grilles, wall-mounted AC units, and a balcony accessed via sliding doors. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery, windows have security grilles which is positive, and the balcony sliding door would need a childproof lock; the empty unfurnished state means no sharp furniture corners but also means significant furnishing costs upfront."}
