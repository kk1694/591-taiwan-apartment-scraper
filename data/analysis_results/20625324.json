{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment in Da'an with hardwood floors, black leather sofas, piano, and traditional furnishings. The unit is clean and well-maintained but dated with older light fixtures, cabinetry, and window grilles. For baby safety, the marble coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, the balcony sliding doors need child locks, and the hardwood floors are good for crawling; the large open layout with no stairs is a plus. Good natural light from the balcony-facing windows, and the 46-ping size provides ample family space."}
