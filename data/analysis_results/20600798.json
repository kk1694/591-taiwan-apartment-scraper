{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment in a high-rise building with recessed lighting, white tile floors, and contemporary finishes. The space appears bright with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the apartment has no visible balcony access and floors are smooth tile with rounded corners on furniture, though the hard tile floors may require rugs for a crawling baby."}
