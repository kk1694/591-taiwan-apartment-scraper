{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Spacious and modern apartment with clean white tile flooring, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture including leather sofas and a marble dining table. The 48 ping size on the 10th floor of a 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and glass partitions near the entrance may need attention, but the open layout provides good visibility; natural light appears adequate from multiple windows with curtains."}
