{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). Spacious open-plan living with crystal chandelier, recessed LED lighting, hardwood floors, modern kitchen with breakfast bar, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) is a concern for heat and potential leaks; the balcony has glass railings which need baby-proofing, and the kitchen bar stools with tall legs are a tipping hazard for a toddler. Overall very clean and well-maintained, but the listing description is just a generic agent ad with no real property details, which is a minor red flag."}
