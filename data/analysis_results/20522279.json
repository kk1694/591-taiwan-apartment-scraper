Living area is spacious with contemporary furniture including a sofa and TV stand. Good natural light from window. For baby safety: floors appear smooth and easy to clean, no visible sharp corners on furniture, but the coffee table has hard edges that may need padding. Building appears to be a modern high-rise (2F of 13F) which typically has elevator access."}
