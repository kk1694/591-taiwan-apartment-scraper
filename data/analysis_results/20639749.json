{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated apartment with brand new furniture still wrapped in plastic. Very spacious living area with open kitchen layout, modern LED lighting, and split AC units. The space appears clean with smooth tile floors and minimal sharp corners, though being on the top floor (7F/7F) without confirmed elevator access could be challenging with a stroller and baby."}
