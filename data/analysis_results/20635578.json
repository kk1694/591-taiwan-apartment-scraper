{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated, unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed lighting, stylish wood-and-stone TV feature wall, split AC units, floor-to-ceiling windows providing abundant natural light, and a modern bathroom with TOTO fixtures. At 64.5 ping this is very spacious for a family. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows and what appears to be a balcony area (image 4) would need childproof locks/gates; the polished tile floors are slippery and could be a concern for a crawling toddler. The unit is completely empty (no furniture), so you would need to furnish it entirely, but this also means no sharp corners from existing furniture."}
