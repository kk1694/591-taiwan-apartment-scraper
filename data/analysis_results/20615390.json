{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, central air conditioning, sleek built-in cabinetry, and polished tile floors. The open-plan living/dining/kitchen area is spacious with excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows and a balcony with glass sliding doors. For baby safety, the polished tile floors could be slippery, the balcony access needs child-proofing, and the glass sliding room dividers have sharp edges to be mindful of; however the overall flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus. The kitchen is well-equipped with modern appliances and the apartment appears very clean and move-in ready."}
