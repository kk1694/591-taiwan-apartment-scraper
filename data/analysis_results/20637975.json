{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern fixtures including stylish LED pendant lighting, recessed lights, wall-mounted AC, flat-screen TV, and new wood-look flooring throughout. The interior is clean and well-staged with a pleasant mint-green accent wall, modern furniture, and ample open floor space. For baby safety, the metal hairpin-leg TV console and bench-style dining table with hard corners are concerns; the 3rd floor walk-up with no visible elevator is a drawback for stroller access. Only 5 living area photos shown with no bedroom, kitchen, or bathroom visible — the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a red flag suggesting limited transparency."}
