{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Brand new, unfurnished luxury apartment in a modern high-rise complex with elegant lobby entrance. The unit features pristine light wood flooring, new white kitchen cabinetry with subway tile backsplash, large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light, and a spacious outdoor balcony/terrace. Baby safety concern: the balcony has glass panel railings which are modern but a toddler could potentially climb on the horizontal rail frame — would need a balcony gate. The apartment appears completely empty and move-in ready, in excellent clean condition with no red flags. At 27 ping this is a generous size for a family, though being unfurnished means significant setup costs."}
