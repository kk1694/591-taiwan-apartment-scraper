{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style Taiwanese apartment with laminate wood flooring, drop ceiling tiles, and traditional carved wooden front door — clean but dated. The unit is spacious (~36 ping) and unfurnished in the living areas with at least two bedrooms containing beds and AC units; windows have security grilles and natural light is moderate. At 3F of a 4-story walkup (no elevator), carrying a stroller up stairs daily is a concern; the balcony sliding doors and low bed frames are worth checking for baby-proofing, but overall the flat open layout with no visible sharp corners or stairs inside is reasonably baby-friendly."}
