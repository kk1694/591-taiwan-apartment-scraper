{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near National Palace Museum, Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious upscale apartment with hardwood floors throughout and ornate bathroom fixtures, but the style is dated (early 2000s luxury aesthetic with baroque mirror, heavy wood tones). The view from the 9th floor directly overlooks the National Palace Museum and surrounding greenery, which is a notable landmark location. The glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners that are a baby safety concern, and the balcony sliding doors would need child locks; the marble bathroom floor could be slippery. Good natural light from large windows and bay window in bedroom, and the unit appears clean and well-maintained despite the older decor."}
