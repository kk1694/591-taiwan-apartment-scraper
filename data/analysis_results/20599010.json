{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very clean, modern renovated apartment with light wood laminate flooring, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and minimalist furniture. The spacious open living/dining area has good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with sheer curtains. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp metal frame corners that would need padding, and the balcony sliding doors should be checked for secure child locks; otherwise the flat layout with no stairs is ideal. Managed by HOYUAN Real Estate Agency, suggesting a professionally maintained foreigner-friendly property at 37 ping, which is a generous size for a family."}
