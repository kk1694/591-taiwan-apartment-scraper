{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei 101, Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious, well-renovated apartment with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, AC units, and a modern white kitchen with stainless steel fridge and glass backsplash. Excellent natural light with mountain and Taipei 101 views from the 11th floor. For baby safety, the slippery polished tile floors in living areas are a concern, and the balcony visible from the kitchen should be checked for railing height; bedroom has wood flooring which is warmer and safer. Very clean, move-in ready condition with no visible red flags."}
