{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated apartment in excellent condition with brand-new furniture still in plastic wrap, modern recessed and LED strip lighting, split AC units in each room, and at least 2 bedrooms with large built-in wardrobes. The living room has large windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the windows have security grilles (visible in bedrooms 4 and 5), and the flat tile/wood flooring with no stairs is good; however, the large living room windows appear to lack safety grilles and would need child locks. At 8F/13F the building almost certainly has an elevator. Overall very clean and move-in ready, but the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag—worth confirming layout details and lease terms directly."}
