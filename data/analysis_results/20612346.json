{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with white tile floors, built-in kitchen with microwave and oven, modern bathroom with glass shower enclosure, and multiple bedrooms with windows. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), on floor 12 of 13 which strongly suggests an elevator building. For baby safety, the unit is single-level with no stairs, has rounded baseboards, and the bathroom glass door and kitchen balcony door should be secured; the apartment is unfurnished so furniture with baby-proofing can be chosen. Natural light appears limited based on the nighttime photos but windows are present in bedrooms."}
