{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated open-plan studio with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, built-in central AC, large wall-mounted TV, stylish pink/grey sofa, and a glass-enclosed bathroom. The space is clean and well-designed but is essentially a single large room with the bed in the living area, which may feel cramped for a couple with a baby despite the 23 ping size. There is a small balcony with railings visible through the sliding glass doors that would need baby-proofing; the open layout has no stairs but the glass bathroom partition and sharp-cornered coffee table are minor concerns. Natural light comes from two windows but faces other buildings closely, limiting brightness."}
