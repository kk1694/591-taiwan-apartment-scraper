{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with light wood finishes, white tile floors, and recessed lighting. The unit has balcony access with floor-to-ceiling sliding doors that would need child safety locks; balcony railings appear to have narrow gaps which is safer for children. Good natural light from multiple windows. Clean condition with no visible red flags. Being on the 11th floor of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
