{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 43-ping apartment on 10F with modern finishes including polished tile floors, split AC units, large sliding glass balcony doors, two bathrooms (one with bathtub useful for baby bathing), and electronic bidet toilets. The living area is clean with minimal furniture and the balcony has glass railings visible through the window; the wet bathroom floors could be slippery for a crawling baby but the open layout with few sharp corners is generally baby-friendly. The description is minimal (agent promotional text only) which is a minor red flag, but the photos show a well-maintained, bright unit with city views."}
