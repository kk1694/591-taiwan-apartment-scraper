Very spacious at 53 ping with multiple bedrooms, central AC, and built-in wardrobes. For baby safety, the marble floors are smooth but slippery, and there are no visible balconies or stairs in the photos; corners appear rounded or furniture-covered. Clean, well-maintained condition with good natural light from large windows."}
