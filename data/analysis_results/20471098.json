{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including classic tile flooring, traditional light fixtures, and an aging kitchen with basic gas stove setup. The unit is clean but shows wear; the balcony area visible through sliding doors has security grilles. Being on 1F eliminates stair concerns for baby but ground floor may have less natural light and security considerations. The floor tiles throughout are hard surfaces that may need area rugs for crawling baby safety."}
