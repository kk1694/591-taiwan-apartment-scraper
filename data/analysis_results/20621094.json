{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with white glossy tile floors, contemporary white kitchen cabinets, split AC units, and modern fixtures throughout. The space is bright with natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the floors are smooth tile which is easy to clean but can be slippery; the open layout has no stairs but exposed TV cables near the floor may need securing. The apartment appears well-maintained and move-in ready with a separate bedroom visible."}
