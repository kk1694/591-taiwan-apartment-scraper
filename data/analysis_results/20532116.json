{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Brand new luxury apartment in excellent condition with high-end finishes including marble bathroom, built-in kitchen with induction cooktop and oven, central AC, and quality wood flooring. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors with balcony access. For baby safety, the balcony glass railings need child-proofing, and the glass shower partition in the bathroom has sharp edges to be aware of; the unit is unfurnished which allows flexibility but the hard tile/marble surfaces in the bathroom could be slippery. The 23-story building certainly has an elevator, and the overall build quality appears very high-end and move-in ready."}
