{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with marble-style flooring, sleek white kitchen cabinets, stainless steel appliances, and minimalist furniture. Clean condition with good recessed lighting throughout. For baby safety: no visible balcony access concerns shown, rounded furniture edges on dining set, but the floor tiles may be slippery. The 6th floor in a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
