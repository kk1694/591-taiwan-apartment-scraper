{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older Taiwanese apartment with dated furniture and decor including traditional wooden entertainment center and dressing table. The unit appears clean and spacious with good natural light from multiple windows, but the window-mounted AC units and overall style suggest an older building. For baby safety, the metal shelving rack and low furniture corners could be concerns; no dangerous balconies visible but windows have security grilles."}
