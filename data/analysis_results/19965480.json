{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with recessed lighting, clean white walls, modern kitchen with built-in oven and washing machine, and open floor plan. The balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors with metal railings that appear reasonably baby-safe, though the glass coffee table corners may need padding. Excellent natural light from large windows, and the apartment appears very clean with no visible red flags."}
