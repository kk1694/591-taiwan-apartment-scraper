{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment in Da'an with hardwood floors, cream leather sofas, built-in wood-panel TV cabinet, and a separate kitchen with decent cabinetry. The unit appears clean but dated (90s-era fixtures, crown molding, older AC units). The glass coffee table with sharp corners and the low balcony-area sliding doors are potential baby safety concerns; the large open floor plan with hardwood is good for a crawling baby but the glass and sharp-edged furniture would need childproofing. Natural light appears moderate from the balcony-side windows but overall the apartment feels a bit dim. Only 5 photos were provided, all showing the living/dining area, which is a minor red flag — no bedroom or bathroom images, and the listing description is essentially empty (just a generic agent ad), suggesting limited information from the landlord."}
