{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Dated apartment with old-style fixtures including window AC units, fluorescent lighting, and decorative floral glass ceiling panels. The space is clean and very spacious (32 ping) with multiple rooms including a Japanese-style room with shoji screens, but has an outdated aesthetic from the 1990s. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout pose slip/fall concerns, and there are no visible balconies in the images which is positive; the large open spaces and low shelving are relatively child-friendly once furnished."}
