{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment on 11F of an 18-story building with excellent condition — recessed LED lighting, polished marble-look tile floors, modern kitchen with stainless steel range hood and marble-effect wall tiles, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing abundant natural light and mountain views. Listed through UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋), an agency specializing in foreigner-friendly rentals. For baby safety, the large windows have low sills that would need childproofing, and the slippery polished tile floors could be a concern for a crawling baby; no stairs visible, and the open layout is spacious at nearly 75 ping. The apartment appears mostly unfurnished (just a sofa and dining set), which is ideal for customizing with baby-safe furniture."}
