{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, recently renovated unfurnished apartment with clean white walls, modern light-grey wood flooring, recessed lighting, split AC units, and large bay windows providing excellent natural light. The open-plan living area is very generous at 41.6 ping; the kitchen is older-style but functional with white tile and gas stove. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is ideal, the balcony has a sliding glass door that can be secured, and there are no visible sharp corners — though the unit is unfurnished so you would need to baby-proof furniture you bring in. Being on 7F of a 14F building strongly suggests elevator access. A potential concern is the completely empty/unfurnished state meaning significant move-in cost, and the description is just a generic agent ad with no real detail about the unit."}
