The open floor plan with spacious living and dining areas is clean and well-maintained. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the balcony visible through sheer curtains should be checked for secure railings; natural light appears good through large windows. Listed through UR HOUSE rental agency specializing in expat housing."}
