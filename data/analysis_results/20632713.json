{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean but older-style apartment with tile floors and dated ceiling light fixtures. Multiple rooms shown are completely empty and unfurnished with AC units installed. Natural light appears limited in some rooms with small windows, and windows have metal security grilles. For baby safety, the tile floors are easy to clean but hard if a child falls; no visible stairs or dangerous balconies in photos, but some rooms appear windowless which is a concern for ventilation."}
