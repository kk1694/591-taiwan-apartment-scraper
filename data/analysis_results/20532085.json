{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, renovated apartment with clean white walls, wood flooring, and contemporary fixtures including wall-mounted AC units and an induction cooktop kitchen. The space appears very clean with good natural light through zebra blinds. For baby safety, the apartment has no visible stairs or balconies in the images, and corners appear rounded; the glass sliding doors between rooms would need childproofing when baby becomes mobile."}
