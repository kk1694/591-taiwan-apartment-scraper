{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "紅樓花園大廈 (Hong Lou Garden Building), Da'an District", "notes": "Older-style apartment in a large residential tower with dated wallpaper and basic fixtures, but clean tile floors and AC units in rooms. The building exterior shows a tall multi-story complex with elevator access. For baby safety, the balcony visible from the living room has sliding glass doors and the bedroom window has security grilles, which is positive; however the hard tile floors throughout could be a concern for a crawling baby, and the building's balcony railings appear to have wider spacing that should be inspected in person. Natural light appears moderate with windows in both the living area and bedroom."}
