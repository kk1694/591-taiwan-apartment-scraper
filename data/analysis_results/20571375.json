{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment with minimalist design, recessed lighting, and quality finishes. The space features rounded furniture corners, no visible stairs, and appears baby-safe with flat floors throughout. The bedroom is quite small with only a single bed visible, which may be cramped for a couple expecting a baby; balcony area visible through dark glass doors should be checked for railing safety."}
