Good natural light through large windows with views of greenery. Baby safety concerns include the raised platform/tatami area in one room which has a small step, and the glass coffee table in the living room. The balcony area visible in the kitchen photo has vertical railings which appear adequate. Overall well-maintained and suitable for a small family."}
