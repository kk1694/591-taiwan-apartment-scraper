{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent hotel-style studio with high-end modern finishes including built-in kitchen appliances, rain shower, and quality fixtures. Very clean and well-maintained. For baby safety: the space is compact at 10 ping which limits movement; the balcony has narrow-spaced railings which is good for safety; furniture has rounded edges; bathroom has glass shower enclosure that would need securing. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows."}
