{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style furnished apartment in clean but dated condition with traditional wooden furniture, tile floors throughout, and window-unit AC in living room plus split AC in bedroom. The glass coffee table with sharp corners and balcony sliding door access are baby safety concerns; the bedrooms have single mattresses on frames which would need upgrading for a couple. At 35.66 ping the space is generous with a separate dining area, but the overall decor and fixtures feel 15-20 years old, and the listing description is essentially just an agent advertisement with no useful property details, which is a minor red flag."}
