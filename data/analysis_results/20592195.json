{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated modern apartment with clean finishes, marble accent walls, recessed lighting, and light wood laminate flooring throughout. The balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass sliding doors which would need safety gates for a baby; furniture has rounded edges which is positive. Natural light appears moderate due to facing other buildings closely, but the interior is bright and very clean with no visible red flags."}
