{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished 1F apartment with clean white tile floors and freshly painted walls, but older-style fixtures including dated light fittings, basic wall-mounted AC units, and aluminum-frame windows suggesting a building from the 1990s or earlier. Being on the 1st floor is convenient for stroller access but may have reduced natural light and potential ground-floor humidity/security concerns; the windows appear to have bars which is positive for baby safety, but the tile floors can be slippery and cold for a crawling baby. The listing description is extremely minimal (just a broker ad template with no real property details), which is a red flag — verify room count, kitchen/bathroom condition, and lease terms directly."}
