{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "This listing at 21.72 ping on the 9th floor of a 15-story building in Da'an District is priced at NT$60,000/month. The description only contains a promotional message for real estate agents and lacks any meaningful details about the apartment's condition, layout, or amenities. Without photos or a substantive description, it is impossible to assess baby safety features, natural light, or modernity; the listing appears to be a placeholder or agent advertisement rather than a genuine rental listing, which is a red flag."}
