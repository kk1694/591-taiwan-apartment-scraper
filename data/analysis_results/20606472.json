{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Chengde Road Section 1, Datong District, near Zhongshan MRT Station (249m) and Shuanglian MRT Station (477m)", "notes": "2BR/1LR/2BA whole-floor unit on 6F/14F elevator building, fully furnished with appliances, includes mechanical parking and balcony. Convenient location near two MRT stations. Note: no pets allowed, NT$5,237/month management fee on top of rent, and 2-month deposit required. For a couple with a baby, the balcony railing safety and window locks should be inspected in person; modernity of fixtures is unclear from the limited description. The price of NT$90,000 is high — verify actual usable space since listed interior is only 17 ping despite 37 ping registered area."}
