{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio with clean white minimalist design, murphy bed that folds into wall, and new appliances including washer-dryer, refrigerator, and microwave. The space is compact but well-utilized. For baby safety, the bar stool could be hazardous, and the enclosed balcony area has large windows that appear to have secure frames. Natural light is moderate through the enclosed balcony windows. Very clean condition overall."}
