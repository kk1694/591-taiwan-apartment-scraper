{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with new wood-look flooring, freshly painted walls, and modern bathroom with marble-style tiles and updated fixtures. The spacious open layout is relatively baby-safe with no visible stairs or dangerous balconies, though corners on doorframes should be covered. Natural light appears limited based on the window sizes and evening photos; the unit is unfurnished and very clean."}
