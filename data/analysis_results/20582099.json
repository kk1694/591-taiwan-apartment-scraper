{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern Muji-style living/dining furniture, wood-look flooring, and clean white walls. The living area and dining area are spacious and well-furnished, but the kitchen is older and basic with exposed gas water heater and dated appliances. At 3F with no elevator visible and only 4 floors, this is likely a walk-up building which is inconvenient with a stroller and baby. The hallway and bedroom areas have some paint wear, and the balcony has security grilles which are good for baby safety, though the window-mount AC unit in the living room and exposed pipes in the kitchen should be baby-proofed."}
