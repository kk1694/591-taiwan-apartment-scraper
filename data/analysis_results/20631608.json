{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment in very clean condition with new tile flooring, fresh white paint, modern kitchen with stainless steel counters and gas stove, and new cabinetry. The unit has sliding glass doors to a balcony in the living room and one bedroom — balcony access will need childproofing with a gate once the baby is mobile. At 28 ping on 3F of a 14-floor building (likely has elevator), this is a spacious, bright, baby-safe blank slate with no sharp built-in corners, though being completely unfurnished means all furniture must be purchased."}
