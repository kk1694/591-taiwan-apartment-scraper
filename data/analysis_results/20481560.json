{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Spacious and modern high-floor apartment with hardwood floors, recessed/cove lighting, central AC, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light and city views. The open-plan living and dining area is very clean and well-maintained with quality furnishings. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp metal legs that would need padding, and the large windows appear to have low sills that would need childproofing; however, no exposed balconies are visible which is a plus. The 13-story building almost certainly has an elevator, and at 58.54 ping this is a generously sized unit suitable for a growing family."}
