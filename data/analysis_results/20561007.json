{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei 101, Xinyi District", "notes": "Upscale modern apartment with sleek finishes, recessed lighting, and quality wood flooring throughout. Excellent natural light with floor-to-ceiling windows and stunning Taipei 101 views. For baby safety, note the open kitchen counter with sharp corners and glass surfaces that would need childproofing; no visible balcony access which is a plus. Very clean and well-maintained, suitable for a professional family."}
