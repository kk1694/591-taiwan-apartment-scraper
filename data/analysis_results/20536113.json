{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older building with renovated living room (recessed lighting, laminate flooring, L-shaped sofa) but dated bedroom with traditional wood cabinets and hardwood floor. Enclosed balconies on both sides have security grilles and tile flooring, which is good for baby safety, though the balcony areas look utilitarian with exposed pipes and laundry equipment. The 2F walk-up location with window-unit AC in the living room and split AC in the bedroom suggests an older building without elevator, and natural light appears limited due to surrounding buildings; at 41 ping this is spacious but the listing description is nearly empty which is a red flag."}
