{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a well-maintained luxury apartment with classic European-style decor featuring ornate furniture, crystal chandeliers, and marble countertops - stylistically dated but in excellent condition. The glass coffee table in the living room presents a baby safety concern, and the hard tile/marble floors throughout could be slippery. Good natural light from large windows, spacious rooms with ample storage, and the kitchen is well-equipped with a skylight feature."}
