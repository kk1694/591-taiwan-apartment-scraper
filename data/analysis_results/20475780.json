{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 72 ping apartment in good clean condition but with dated 1990s-style decor including terrazzo floors, older light fixtures, and beige leather furniture. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony with sliding doors requires attention for child safety. Excellent natural light throughout with large windows, multiple bedrooms visible, and a functional galley kitchen with modern appliances."}
