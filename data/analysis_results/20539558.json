{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with stylish minimalist design featuring track lighting, light wood-tone flooring, split AC, modern kitchen with Panasonic fridge and built-in cabinetry, and a clean contemporary bathroom with glass shower partition. The space appears clean and well-maintained with no sharp corners on furniture; the open-plan layout is baby-friendly, though the large floor-to-ceiling curtained windows should be checked for secure balcony railings behind them. Being on 2F of a 24-floor building strongly suggests elevator access; the 25-ping size is decent for a couple with a baby, though no separate bedroom is visible in these photos suggesting it may be a studio-style layout."}
