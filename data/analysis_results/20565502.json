The building has an upscale hotel-style lobby. Baby safety concerns: balcony railings have decorative patterns with gaps that could be dangerous for toddlers - consider adding mesh/plexiglass barriers. Good natural light from large windows on 14th floor with nice city views. Very clean, unfurnished unit ready to move in."}
