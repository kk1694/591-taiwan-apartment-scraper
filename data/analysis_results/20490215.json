{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with sleek white cabinetry, split-unit AC, track lighting, and contemporary furnishings including a marble-top dining table. The unit is clean and bright with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a small balcony. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp metal corners, the balcony railing appears relatively low and should be checked in person, and the glass balcony door could be a pinch hazard for small fingers. The open kitchen layout is convenient but the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — verify actual layout and room count in person."}
