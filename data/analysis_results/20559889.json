{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Excellent high-end unfurnished apartment in a modern high-rise building (3F/20F, almost certainly with elevator). Very spacious at 64 ping with pristine white walls, polished tile floors, recessed ceiling AC, modern pendant lighting, and a luxury bathroom with bathtub, glass-enclosed shower, and Japanese-style smart toilet. For baby safety, the windows have raised sills acting as barriers, no visible balconies or dangerous railings, and the tile floors are smooth with no sharp corners — though the hard polished tiles could be slippery; area rugs would be advisable. The unit is completely unfurnished so you'd need to purchase all furniture, but this also means you can baby-proof from scratch. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), indicating foreigner-friendly landlord. Natural light is decent from multiple windows. At NT$100,000/month this is premium pricing but justified by the size, condition, and Zhongzheng location."}
