{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Modern apartment with clean white walls, light wood-tone built-in furniture, AC unit, and floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a balcony area. The space appears bright and well-maintained. Being on 8F/8F (top floor) with no confirmed elevator could be a concern for carrying a stroller; the balcony glass doors should be kept locked for baby safety. Only one image available so full layout assessment is limited, but the visible room looks like a clean, recently renovated unit managed by UR House rental services."}
