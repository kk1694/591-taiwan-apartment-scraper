{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with recessed lighting, sleek white kitchen with built-in oven, gas stove, and ample cabinetry. The bathroom features a soaking tub with glass partition and modern fixtures. For baby safety, the coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but the glass shower partition in the bathroom and the bathtub without a cover could be concerns; the large windows appear to have secure frames but balcony access should be verified. The space is very clean, well-furnished with good natural light from large windows, and at 78 ping is extremely spacious for a family — listed via Dingli Rental Service agent."}
