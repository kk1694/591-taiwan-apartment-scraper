{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu", "notes": "Upscale community complex with grand European-style courtyard, landscaped gardens, indoor swimming pool, and children's water play area — excellent amenities for a family. The interior appears clean and well-maintained with recessed lighting, tile floors, dark wood trim, and a video intercom system, though only the hallway/dining area is shown so full condition is unclear. The 14-floor building certainly has an elevator; the 2-balcony layout warrants checking railing heights for baby safety, but the high-end complex suggests good build quality overall."}
