{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with stylish finishes including recessed LED lighting, concrete-textured accent walls, and dark wood built-in cabinetry. The space is clean and well-designed but appears compact with an open-plan kitchen featuring only a small induction cooktop, microwave, and round sink — limited cooking capability for a family. Baby safety concerns include the tall bar stools (tipping hazard), the marble-topped coffee table with hard edges, and the large low windows without visible child-safety locks; natural light is decent from the side windows but the view faces neighboring buildings closely."}
