{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern, well-finished apartment in a newer high-rise building with sleek built-in cabinetry, LED accent lighting, light wood flooring, and floor-to-ceiling windows. The living room is clean and spacious with a large built-in TV wall unit; one bedroom appears to be a loft-style mezzanine with low ceilings which could feel cramped. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the mezzanine bedroom's low ceiling and potential access via stairs is a concern; however the overall condition is excellent with good natural light from large windows on multiple sides."}
