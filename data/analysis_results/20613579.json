{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with fresh white walls, new light-colored wood laminate flooring, modern LED ceiling lights, black-framed sliding glass doors to balcony, and wall-mounted AC. The 16-story building on floor 6 almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the balcony has solid brick railings with glass doors that can be locked, and the interior is spacious with no stairs or sharp corners; however, the unit is completely empty with no kitchen or bathroom photos shown (a glimpse of an older-style tiled bathroom is visible), so the kitchen/bath condition is uncertain. Good natural light from multiple windows and the balcony, very clean condition overall."}
