{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, renovated apartment with modern recessed lighting, built-in storage, and wall-mounted AC units. The unit is spacious at ~30 ping with tiled floors throughout and appears well-maintained. For baby safety, the apartment is single-level with no visible stairs, but there are some sharp corners on built-in cabinetry and the low platform bed that may need baby-proofing; natural light appears limited with small windows."}
