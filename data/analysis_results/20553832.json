{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Very high-end modern apartment with premium finishes including marble feature wall, recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, U-shaped kitchen with marble countertops, and sleek built-in cabinetry throughout. The spacious 52-ping layout with large open living/dining area and floor-to-ceiling windows with zebra blinds provides excellent natural light. For baby safety, the highly polished tile floors could be slippery, and the glass-topped furniture and sharp-cornered marble kitchen island would need padding; no visible balcony railings or stairs are a concern, and the overall cleanliness and condition are excellent."}
