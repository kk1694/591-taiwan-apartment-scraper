{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment in excellent condition with clean tile floors, recessed lighting, and intercom system. The balcony has glass panels with metal railings which are relatively safe but would need supervision with a toddler. Good natural light from large sliding doors, mountain/forest views, unfurnished with spacious open layout - no sharp corners or stairs visible, making it reasonably baby-friendly."}
