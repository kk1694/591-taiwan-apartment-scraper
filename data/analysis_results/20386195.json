{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with open-plan living/dining area, modern kitchen, clean bathroom with glass shower enclosure, and multiple bedrooms. The space is very clean with good natural light from windows. For baby safety, the glass dining table has sharp corners and the bathroom has hard tile floors; no visible balcony railings or stairs to assess, but the overall layout is spacious and single-level which is good for a family."}
