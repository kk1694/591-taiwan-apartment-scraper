{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with sleek minimalist design, LED strip lighting, marble-look flooring, and contemporary furniture. The space appears clean and well-maintained with a modern kitchen. For baby safety: the round coffee table has metal edges that could be a concern, and the hard marble-look floor tiles may require area rugs; no visible balcony or stairs in photos. Being on 4F of a 15F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
