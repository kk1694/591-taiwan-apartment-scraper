{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including recessed lighting, split AC units, zebra blinds, leather sofa, wall-mounted TV, and clean white tile flooring. Being on the top floor (4F/4F) of a low-rise building with no elevator is a significant concern for carrying a baby and stroller up stairs daily. The apartment appears very clean and baby-safe with no visible balcony hazards, smooth rounded furniture, and good natural light from multiple windows, though only the living room and bedroom are shown — kitchen and bathroom are not visible."}
