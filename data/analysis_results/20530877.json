{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wenshan District", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment with high-end interior design featuring marble TV wall, engineered wood flooring, recessed lighting, central AC, and built-in cabinetry throughout. Very spacious at ~180 sqm with a large living room, dining area with kitchen, study/kids room with built-in shelving, and a bedroom with full-height wardrobes. Good natural light from large windows with blinds. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is ideal; open shelving in the study room would need childproofing, and the low window sills in the living room should be checked. The 10th floor location in an 11-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Listed via 德鄰租屋 agency; the description is minimal (just an ad for agent services), which is a minor red flag — verify actual terms and included furnishings directly."}
