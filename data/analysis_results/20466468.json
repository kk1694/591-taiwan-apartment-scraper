{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, central AC, quality built-in cabinetry, and stylish bathroom with contemporary fixtures. The unit appears very clean with smooth tile flooring and no obvious baby hazards like exposed sharp corners; balcony visible through glass doors has railings but would need inspection for gap spacing. Good natural light from balcony doors, though being on 2F of 15F building suggests elevator access is very likely."}
