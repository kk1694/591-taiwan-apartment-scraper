{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with polished tile floors, modern security door with video intercom, and recessed lighting. At 36 ping with at least 3 bedrooms, it offers good space for a family; the bedroom has a balcony door with railings that should be checked for baby safety, and the hard tile floors throughout are easy to clean but slippery. The building is 13 floors (2F unit) strongly suggesting elevator access, and the unit appears bright with windows in multiple rooms, though the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag worth verifying details in person."}
