{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large spacious apartment with traditional/dated Taiwanese decor featuring ornate wood paneling, chandeliers, and marble flooring. Clean but with an older aesthetic from the 1990s-2000s. For baby safety: the raised platform areas by windows and multiple floor levels between rooms could be tripping hazards; the low window seats provide good natural light but no visible safety railings. Good ventilation with multiple AC units and windows on different sides."}
