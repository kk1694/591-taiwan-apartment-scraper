{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern industrial-style track lighting, light wood laminate flooring, built-in kitchen with oven, AC, washing machine, and a separate bedroom with sliding-door wardrobe. The space is very clean and well-finished but the bedroom is quite small with only a transom window offering limited natural light; the main living area has a balcony door with floor-to-ceiling grille that provides some light. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is good, but exposed track lighting rails and sharp-cornered bedside tables would need childproofing."}
