{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with light wood laminate flooring, recessed LED ceiling lighting, and clean minimalist finishes throughout. The unit features a spacious living room, separate kitchen, dining area, bedroom with natural pine bed frame, and a bathroom with glass door — all in excellent, move-in-ready condition. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is ideal; however, the glass bathroom door and low coffee table with metal legs are minor concerns. Being on 2F of a 17-floor building in Zhongshan district strongly suggests elevator access. Natural light is decent from windows facing greenery, though the 2F level means it may be somewhat limited."}
