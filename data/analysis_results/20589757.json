{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a residential apartment currently configured as an office space, with red partition dividers, office desks, and cubicle-style furniture throughout the main living area. The kitchen is modern with white glossy cabinets, gas stove, microwave, and glass backsplash. While the finishes are clean and updated (recessed lighting, marble-look TV wall, white tile floors, AC units), the office furniture setup is a major red flag — this space is being used commercially and would need significant clearing and reconfiguration for residential use. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout would need rugs/mats, and the 2F walkup with no visible elevator could be challenging with a stroller."}
