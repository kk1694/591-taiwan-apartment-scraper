{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with marble-look floor tiles, recessed LED lighting, split-unit AC, marble accent wall, and a well-equipped kitchen with large refrigerator and gas stove. The unit is unfurnished and in excellent, clean condition at 25 ping. Being on the 1st floor is convenient for a family with a baby (no stairs needed), but natural light appears limited as windows show mostly neighboring structures; the bedroom window with iron security bars has a small balcony area visible. No major baby safety red flags—floors are smooth and flat with no stairs, though the hard tile flooring would benefit from soft mats for a crawling baby."}
