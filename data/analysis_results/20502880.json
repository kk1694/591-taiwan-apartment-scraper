{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed lighting, wood-look laminate flooring, white built-in cabinetry, marble-top dining table, and updated kitchen. At least two bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and en-suite bathrooms visible. The space is very clean with rounded coffee table edges and no visible balcony or dangerous railings, which is positive for baby safety; however, the glass bathroom door in the living area and some open shelving with sharp corners should be baby-proofed. Natural light appears moderate — windows are present but face close neighboring buildings, and the 9th floor location with no balcony reduces fall risk for a child."}
