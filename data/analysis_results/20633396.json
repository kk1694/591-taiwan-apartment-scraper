{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern Scandinavian-style design, light wood flooring, and contemporary fixtures including ceiling fans and recessed lighting. The space appears clean with rounded furniture edges and low coffee tables that are relatively baby-friendly, though the staircase railing visible in image 1 may need baby gates. Being on the 7th floor of a 7-floor building without visible elevator confirmation is a concern for a family with a baby."}
