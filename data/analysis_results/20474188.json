{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment with contemporary finishes including track lighting, built-in kitchen with gas stove, microwave, and full-size refrigerator. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the open layout is generally safe but the small balcony/service area access door would need childproofing; no visible stairs or dangerous railings inside the unit. Clean and well-maintained condition."}
