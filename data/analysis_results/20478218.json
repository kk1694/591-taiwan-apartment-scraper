{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with dark reddish-brown hardwood floors, furnished with a large TV, sofa, dining table, full kitchen with island counter, and a bedroom with double bed and wardrobe. The unit is clean and well-maintained but has dated fixtures and traditional Taiwanese styling rather than modern renovation. For baby safety, the hard wood floors and sharp furniture corners (TV stand, dining table, kitchen island) are concerns; windows appear to have security bars which is good, but natural light seems moderate with smaller windows. At 39.5 ping on the 2nd floor, no elevator is confirmed but the low floor mitigates this; the listing description is minimal (agent advertisement only) which is a minor red flag."}
