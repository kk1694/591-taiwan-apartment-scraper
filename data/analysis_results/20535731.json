{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with traditional wooden furniture, hardwood floors, and window AC units indicating an aging building. The space is clean and reasonably well-maintained with multiple bedrooms suitable for a family. Windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, but the balcony has wide railing gaps that could be a concern; the wooden furniture has some sharp corners to be mindful of."}
