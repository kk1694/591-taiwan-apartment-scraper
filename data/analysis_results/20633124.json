{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a 2-story townhouse/shophouse (透天) in Beitou, not a standard apartment. The ground floor has a street-level entrance with large glass sliding doors opening directly to the road, tiled walls resembling a former commercial space, and exposed plumbing fixtures — suggesting it was previously a shop or restaurant. The interior staircase connecting floors is a major baby safety hazard with no visible gate or railing protection. Upstairs rooms are basic with older fixtures (window AC units, dated ceiling lights, minimal furnishings), and one small room under the staircase has a sloped ceiling. Overall the space is clean but dated and unfurnished; the commercial ground-floor layout and steep internal stairs make it poorly suited for a couple with a baby."}
