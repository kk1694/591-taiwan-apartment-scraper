{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end luxury apartment with designer finishes including marble TV wall, herringbone dark wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, built-in kitchen appliances, and sleek cabinetry. The open-plan layout is spacious at ~48 ping with a freestanding bathtub visible in the master suite. For baby safety, the dark polished floors may be slippery, the open bathtub area lacks barriers, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows/balcony doors would need childproofing; however the flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — request full details on layout, number of rooms, and lease terms directly from the Sung Hsin Real Estate agent."}
