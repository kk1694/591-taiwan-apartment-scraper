{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with stylish wooden accents, clean hardwood floors, and excellent natural light through large windows. The space has a trendy open kitchen with breakfast bar, cozy bedroom, and mountain views. For baby safety, note the decorative branch/cat climbing structure near ceiling could be a concern, and the balcony visible in images would need childproofing. Being on 6F/6F (top floor) with no elevator info is worth confirming."}
