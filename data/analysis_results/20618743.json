{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a converted commercial/office space rather than a residential apartment - note the commercial drop ceiling with fluorescent lighting, open floor plan without proper room divisions, and office-style layout. The space is extremely cluttered with boxes and storage, has dated furniture, and lacks proper residential features like a kitchen area visible. For a family with a baby, this is unsuitable due to the non-residential design, significant clutter hazards, and very limited natural light from only a few small windows."}
