{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a duplex-style apartment with a mezzanine loft and internal staircase - a significant baby safety concern as the stairs lack gates and the upper balustrade has wide spindle gaps. The interior is clean but dated with older wooden cabinetry and traditional fixtures. Good natural light from multiple windows; spacious at 54 ping but the multi-level layout is not ideal for a family with a baby."}
