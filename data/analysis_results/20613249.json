{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean white walls, light wood cabinetry, built-in kitchen with microwave and oven, AC, and recessed lighting. The unit appears to have a living area, separate bathroom, and at least one bedroom — all with smooth tile flooring and no stairs, which is good for baby safety. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). However, the space looks like it may be unfurnished (no visible bed or sofa), no windows are visible in any photo suggesting limited natural light, and at 20 ping for NT$46,999 in Neihu it is on the pricier side; confirm window/balcony situation and whether furniture is included before committing."}
