{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Fengji Huangju (豐基皇居) building", "notes": "Clean, newly renovated empty unit with modern polished tile floors, crystal ceiling lights, and wall-mounted AC. The apartment is unfurnished with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: the tile floors are slippery, and one bedroom has floor-to-ceiling windows that would need child safety measures. Being on the 3rd floor of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
