{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious upscale unfurnished apartment with polished marble flooring in the living room, crystal chandelier, built-in wood cabinetry in the master bedroom, and a modern white kitchen with gas stove and ample storage. The unit is very clean and well-maintained with good natural light from large windows with greenery visible outside. For baby safety, the marble floors in the living area are very slippery and would need rugs/mats; the low platform bed frame in the bedroom has edges to watch for, and glass sliding doors in one room could be a concern for a crawling toddler, but overall the flat layout with no stairs is good for a young family."}
