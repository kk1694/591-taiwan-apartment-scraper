{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, brand-new or recently renovated apartment with pristine white tile floors, clean white walls, wall-mounted AC units, and contemporary dark wood trim. The unit is completely unfurnished with multiple rooms, a digital intercom panel, and built-in shoe cabinet at the entryway. Good natural light from large windows. Being on floor 5 of 18 in a newer high-rise strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the polished tile floors could be slippery but there are no visible balconies, stairs, or sharp corners in these images; the unit appears very clean and safe overall. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad) which is a minor red flag — more details about layout and amenities should be confirmed."}
