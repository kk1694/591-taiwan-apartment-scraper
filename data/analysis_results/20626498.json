{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in wardrobes, and AC units. The unit appears to have at least 2-3 bedrooms including a child's room with loft bed (potential fall hazard for baby). Natural light is limited with small windows; the balcony has half-height glass panels which would need additional safety barriers for a crawling child."}
