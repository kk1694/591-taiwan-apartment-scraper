{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Brand new, high-end unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed lighting, marble-look accent wall, built-in wooden cabinetry, and polished tile floors throughout. At least 3 bedrooms visible with built-in platform beds and storage; the spacious living area has large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. Baby safety is generally good — no open balconies visible (windows appear sealed with dark frames), smooth rounded built-in furniture with no sharp corners, and flat single-level layout; however the floor-to-ceiling glass door in one room could need a child lock. Listed through UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a foreigner-friendly rental agency, which is a positive sign for an expat couple. The 14-floor building on the 4th floor almost certainly has an elevator."}
