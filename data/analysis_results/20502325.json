{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and recently renovated apartment with sleek dark-toned accent walls, recessed LED lighting, marble TV wall, split-type AC, and contemporary furnishings including an L-shaped sofa and marble-top dining table. The kitchen has modern dark cabinetry and a full-size refrigerator. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the glass-panel front door/balcony door has horizontal bars which are good for security but the spacing should be checked; the unit appears to be on the 3rd floor of a 15-story building suggesting elevator access. The apartment is very clean and well-maintained but natural light appears limited based on the photos, and the dining/kitchen area is compact which may feel tight with baby gear."}
