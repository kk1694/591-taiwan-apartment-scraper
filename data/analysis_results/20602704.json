{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully furnished modern apartment with high-end finishes, elegant furniture, and excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows on the 13th floor. The space appears clean and well-maintained with no obvious baby safety hazards visible, though the glass coffee table edges and balcony access would need attention. The open layout and polished tile floors are easy to clean but may be slippery for a crawling baby."}
