{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua, near a school with running track", "notes": "Brand new, unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, modern kitchen with built-in appliances, marble-style backsplash, and high-end cabinetry. On the 13th floor of a 14-story building (almost certainly has elevator), with great natural light and open city/school views. For baby safety, the unit is a blank slate with no stairs or sharp built-in corners, but being unfurnished means you'd need to buy everything; the high floor and exposed pipes on the ceiling are minor concerns but overall this is a very clean, safe space for a young family."}
