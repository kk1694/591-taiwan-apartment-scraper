{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Upscale, modern studio-style apartment with designer finishes including herringbone dark wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, a sculptural room divider, and built-in appliances (oven visible in kitchen area). The open-plan layout lacks separation between living and sleeping areas, which may limit privacy but provides a spacious feel at 34 ping. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp metal frame edges and the hard dark flooring are concerns; the balcony area visible through floor-to-ceiling windows would need child-proofing. Listed via Miller House (美樂房屋), an agency that commonly serves foreign tenants, and the 11-floor building on the 3rd floor almost certainly has an elevator."}
