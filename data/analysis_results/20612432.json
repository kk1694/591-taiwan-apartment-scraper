{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, well-maintained modern apartment with recessed lighting, AC units, and quality wood-tone built-in cabinetry. The space appears relatively baby-safe with rounded furniture edges and no visible stairs, though the bar stools could be a tipping hazard. Good natural light in the bedroom; the main living area relies more on artificial lighting. Exit sign visible near entrance suggests this is in a proper building with elevator access."}
