{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-renovated apartment with modern finishes including recessed AC, glossy tile flooring, and built-in cabinetry. The living and dining areas are bright with good natural light. Major baby safety concern: one bedroom has an open jacuzzi bathtub directly in the room with no enclosure, posing a serious drowning hazard for a toddler. Being on 4F/4F with no elevator info is a concern for stroller access. The balcony has decorative iron railings that appear climbable."}
