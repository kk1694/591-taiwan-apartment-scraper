{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, open-plan living/dining/kitchen area, and at least two bedrooms plus a smaller study/nursery room. The unit appears clean with updated fixtures and built-in storage. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery, the balcony area visible through sliding glass doors should be checked for secure railings given the 7th floor height, and furniture corners on the wooden dining set and coffee table may need padding; natural light is decent through large windows, and the smaller third room could work well as a baby room."}
