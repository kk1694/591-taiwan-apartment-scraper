{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed lighting, AC, light wood flooring, and clean white cabinetry. The open kitchen has a glass backsplash and good natural light through large windows with decorative balcony railings. For baby safety, the window railings appear adequately spaced, but the mostly empty layout is good for adding baby-proofing; exposed floor-level electrical outlets would need covers."}
