{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older building with basic renovations - clean wood laminate flooring and fresh paint but dated ceiling texture and fixtures. The balcony in the bedroom has metal railings with wide gaps that would be a safety concern for a crawling baby. Spacious layout with multiple rooms and good natural light from balcony windows; appears clean but furnishings are minimal and budget-grade."}
