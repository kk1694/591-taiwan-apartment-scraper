{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with hardwood floors, built-in shelving with accent lighting, split AC units, and good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Baby safety note: visible metal staircase railing with wide gaps in one room poses a significant fall hazard; sharp-edged coffee table would need corner guards. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with a contemporary aesthetic."}
