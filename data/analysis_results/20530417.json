{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment in excellent condition with luxury finishes including marble TV feature wall, crystal chandeliers, recessed LED lighting, and polished tile floors. The spacious 48-ping living area has large black-framed windows providing good natural light and a balcony with metal railings that appear adequately spaced but would need baby-proofing; the smooth tile floors are slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby. The building appears to be a newer construction (likely with elevator given the modern style and 7-floor building), and the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — no details on layout, rooms, or amenities are provided despite the high NT$80,000 price."}
