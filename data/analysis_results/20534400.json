{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment with sleek built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, light wood-tone flooring, and a minimalist grey/dark wood color scheme. The space is clean and well-finished but appears to be a single open-plan room (studio) with bed and sofa in the same area, which at 22 ping is decent but may feel tight for a couple with a baby. There is a small balcony with dark metal railings visible through floor-to-ceiling windows; the balcony gap spacing should be checked for baby safety. No kitchen or bathroom photos were provided, which is a red flag — confirm cooking facilities and overall layout before committing. The 15-floor building on 2F almost certainly has an elevator."}
