{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large top-floor apartment with dated cabinetry and 1990s-style fixtures despite recent renovation. The open living spaces are clean with good natural light from skylights and windows, but the kitchen has older appliances. For baby safety: the small step between tile and wood floor areas could be a tripping hazard, and the balcony with low brick wall visible from the living room needs childproofing. Being on 16F, an elevator is almost certain."}
