{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious living room with modern gray sofa set, clean white tile flooring, and a built-in TV wall unit with stone-look tiling. The apartment has a balcony with sliding glass doors providing decent natural light, and a window-type AC unit suggesting an older building shell despite modern interior renovation. For baby safety, the balcony railing height should be verified on-site, and the coffee table has sharp metal corners that may need padding; the tile floors are slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — more details and room photos would be needed to assess bedrooms and kitchen."}
