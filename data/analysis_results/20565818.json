{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment in a newer high-rise building with clean white tiles, recessed LED lighting, split-level loft design with stairs leading to an upper bedroom with hardwood floors. The stairs without visible railings/gates are a significant baby safety concern and would need baby gates installed; the large floor-to-ceiling windows also need child locks. Excellent natural light from multiple large windows, spacious open-plan living area with TV, sofa, kitchenette, and bathroom visible; the building exterior looks new and upscale with 11 floors strongly suggesting elevator access."}
