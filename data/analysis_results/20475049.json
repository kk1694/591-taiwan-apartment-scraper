{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylish loft-style apartment with high ceilings, modern industrial design, light wood flooring, and a well-equipped kitchen with gas stove and bar counter. The open living area has good natural light from tall windows. For baby safety, the metal dining chairs have hard edges, the loft/mezzanine area visible above the kitchen has open metal railings that could be hazardous, and the bar stools near the kitchen island are a tipping risk. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on bedrooms, bathroom, and balcony."}
