{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with stylish design — modern wood-tone laminate flooring throughout, accent walls in green and blue-grey, open-plan kitchen with stainless steel fridge, and a nicely tiled bathroom with glass shower partition. At 23 ping with at least two bedrooms, the layout is spacious and suitable for a couple with a baby; the flat single-level floor plan with no stairs is a plus, though the bathroom's glass shower door and hexagonal tile floor could be slippery. The building is 12 floors (8F) strongly suggesting elevator access, and windows in the bedrooms and dining area provide decent natural light, though views appear to face neighboring buildings."}
