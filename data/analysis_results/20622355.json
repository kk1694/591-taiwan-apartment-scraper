{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, fully furnished apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, LED accent lighting behind TV wall unit, and a sleek black-and-white design scheme. The unit includes a kitchenette with washing machine, fridge, and microwave, plus a separate bedroom with double bed. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows should be checked for secure locks; the floors are smooth tile which is easy to clean but slippery. The description is minimal (just an agent promotion), so no red flags from text, but only 5 photos were provided with no bathroom or balcony views shown."}
