{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed LED lighting, new wood-grain laminate flooring, built-in cabinetry, and multiple AC units throughout. The unit is spacious at 53 ping and unfurnished, giving flexibility for baby-proofing; the balcony has a safety net overhead and a solid half-wall railing which is positive for child safety, though the exposed pipes on the balcony and open shelving with sharp corners inside would need attention. Good natural light from large sliding glass doors in the living area, and the overall cleanliness is very high suggesting a fresh renovation, but the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only) which is a minor red flag — confirm layout details and whether kitchen fixtures are included."}
