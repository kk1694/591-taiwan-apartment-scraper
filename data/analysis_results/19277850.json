{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Technology Building MRT Station (科技大樓站), Yaodong Garden (耀東花園), Da'an District", "notes": "Older-style apartment with traditional Chinese wooden furniture, window-unit AC, and dated fixtures — clean but not modern. The unit is spacious at 37.3 ping with multiple bedrooms, a separate kitchen with gas stove, and a private laundry area. For baby safety, the heavy wooden furniture has sharp corners that would need padding, and the open kitchen doorway to the laundry/balcony area should be gated; however the listing mentions elderly-friendly handrails (高齡友善扶手) which is a plus. Natural light appears decent with windows in each room, though some rooms face close neighboring buildings."}
