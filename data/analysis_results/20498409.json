{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Building appears to be a high-end modern complex with luxurious lobby featuring marble floors, elevators, water feature, and lounge area. Only one actual apartment photo shown (bedroom with basic furnishings and pink walls). The bedroom looks clean but dated compared to the impressive common areas. For baby safety: only bedroom visible appears safe with no obvious hazards, but limited views of the actual unit make full assessment difficult. The 14th floor location with elevator access is convenient."}
