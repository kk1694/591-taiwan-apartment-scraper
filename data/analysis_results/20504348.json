{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with white tile floors, wall-mounted window AC units, and dated light fixtures; the building has an elevator with marble lobby and accessibility features. The unit is unfurnished, clean, and spacious at ~30 ping with a tree-lined boulevard nearby suggesting a pleasant neighborhood. For baby safety, the balcony has metal security grilles on the windows which is good, the sliding doors to the balcony would need child locks, and the tile floors are hard so area rugs would be advisable; no major red flags but the dated condition and lack of furnishings mean additional setup costs."}
