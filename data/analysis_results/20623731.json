{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern and stylish apartment with marble-look wall tiles, crystal chandeliers, recessed ceiling AC, glossy white tile floors, and a kitchen island with bar seating. The unit is in excellent, clean condition with quality furnishings. For baby safety, the highly polished tile floors could be slippery, there appears to be a balcony with metal railings visible through sliding glass doors that would need childproofing, and the hard stone/tile surfaces throughout present bump risks. The 13-story building almost certainly has an elevator; natural light appears moderate from the balcony side but limited overall due to the narrow layout."}
