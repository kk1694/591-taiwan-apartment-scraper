{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Images show building amenities (luxury lobby lounge, landscaped courtyard, underground parking) rather than the actual apartment unit. The building appears to be a modern high-rise complex with upscale common areas. Cannot assess apartment condition, layout, or baby safety concerns since no interior unit photos were provided. The 9th floor location and underground parking suggest elevator access. Red flag: listing may be misleading as it only shows building features, not the rental unit itself."}
