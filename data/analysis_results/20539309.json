{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including 1990s-style chandeliers and cream leather sofas. Clean but showing age with some wall discoloration. Spacious open layout with good natural light. Balcony has standard metal railings that would need safety netting for a baby. Sharp coffee table corners could be a concern. No obvious red flags but would benefit from furniture updates."}
