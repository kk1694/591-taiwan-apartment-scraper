{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with quality finishes including recessed lighting, wood laminate flooring, wall-mounted AC units, and a clean modern bathroom with glass shower enclosure. The unit appears very clean with rounded furniture edges on coffee table, though the glass coffee table could be a concern for crawling babies. At 2F in a 5-story building with no visible elevator in photos, accessibility may require verification. Good natural light from large windows with frosted glass for privacy."}
