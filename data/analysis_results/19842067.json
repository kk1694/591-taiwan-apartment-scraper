{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated finishes — yellow painted walls, tile floors, older-style ceiling light fixtures, and a traditional Japanese-style raised tatami room with sliding wooden doors. The bathroom appears relatively clean with updated shower fixtures but is a basic wet-room layout with no separation. For baby safety, the raised tatami room step and the spiral staircase visible in image 5 are concerns; the metal security grille on the right side of the living room suggests a balcony area that would need child-proofing. At 33 ping the space is generous for the price in Da'an, but the overall condition is quite dated and would need significant furnishing since the unit is unfurnished."}
