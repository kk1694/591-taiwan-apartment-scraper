{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated high-end apartment on the 23rd floor with professional interior design (Huru Design). Features herringbone wood flooring, custom built-in cabinetry, recessed LED lighting, designer ceiling fan, large wall-mounted TV, modern kitchen with full-size refrigerator, and stylish lounge chairs. For baby safety: the furniture has mostly rounded edges and low-profile designs, but the metal-legged chairs and open shelving with decorative items could be hazards for a crawling baby. The high floor (23F) means an elevator is almost certainly present, and windows appear to have blinds but balcony access and railing safety should be verified in person."}
