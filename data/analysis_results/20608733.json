{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with high-quality dark wood built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, and polished tile floors throughout. The spacious living area has a glass coffee table with sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the kitchen has accessible lower cabinets. Being on the 1st floor eliminates stair concerns but natural light appears limited due to frosted windows and minimal exterior exposure."}
