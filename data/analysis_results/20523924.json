{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with clean white walls, stylish furniture, and excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. The space is very clean with polished tile floors and contemporary fixtures including AC units. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners to watch out for, and there appears to be a balcony visible through the sliding doors that would need child-proofing; the layout is open and single-level with no stairs visible."}
