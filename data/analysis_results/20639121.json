{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Kangding Road 43, Wanhua District (康定路43號), near Ximen Elementary School / Taipei Hospital North Branch MRT Station, Kangzhuang Building (康莊大廈)", "notes": "3-room unit (28 ping) on 6F of a 10F elevator building with balcony, natural gas, and furnished basics including AC, fridge, washer. Good natural light reported. One room is a Japanese tatami space which could be baby-friendly (soft floor, no sharp bed frame edges), but the balcony railings should be inspected for child safety. Building age and modernity are unclear from the sparse description — Wanhua/Kangding Road area typically has older buildings, so fixtures may not be fully modern. The 2-year minimum lease and NT$40,000 price point are reasonable for this size in this district. No obvious red flags, but an in-person visit is strongly recommended to check balcony safety, window locks, and overall condition."}
