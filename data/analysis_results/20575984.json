{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed lighting, and quality finishes throughout. Excellent natural light from large windows. The space appears safe for a baby - no visible stairs, rounded furniture edges on coffee table, and the enclosed balcony area has floor-to-ceiling glass doors providing separation. Glass coffee table edges could be a minor concern once baby is mobile."}
