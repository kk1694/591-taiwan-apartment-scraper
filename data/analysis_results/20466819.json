{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxury modern apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, designer furniture, marble-textured TV wall, and light wood flooring. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with city views. For baby safety: the sharp corners on the coffee table and dining table would need padding, and the floor lamp could be a tipping hazard; however, no dangerous balcony or stairs visible. Being on 9F/9F (top floor) in a modern high-rise strongly suggests elevator access."}
