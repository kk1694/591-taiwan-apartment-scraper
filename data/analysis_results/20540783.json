{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Luxuriously decorated apartment with European-style furnishings including ornate sofas, glass-top coffee tables, and damask wallpaper. The unit is on the 13th floor of a 14-story building, strongly suggesting an elevator. At 71 ping this is very spacious. Baby safety concerns include the glass coffee table with sharp ornate corners, small decorative ottomans that could tip, and the raised step between the entryway and living area; the large windows appear to have good natural light. The unit is in excellent, clean condition but the description is minimal (appears to be a broker listing placeholder), which is a minor red flag regarding transparency."}
