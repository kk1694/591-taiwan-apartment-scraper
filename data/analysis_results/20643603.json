{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "The listing description is essentially empty, containing only a generic advertising tagline for the agent platform rather than any property details. Being on floor 7 of 18 strongly suggests elevator access. At 16.14 ping and NT$50,000/month in Datong District, this is a moderately sized apartment at a reasonable price point. Without images or a real description, it is impossible to assess condition, baby safety features, natural light, or any red flags - the lack of description itself is a minor red flag suggesting the listing may be incomplete or low-effort."}
