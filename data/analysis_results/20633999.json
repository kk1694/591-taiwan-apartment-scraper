Fully furnished with new appliances and good natural light reported. Top-floor added structures can have heat/leak issues and may pose baby safety concerns with rooftop access or uneven flooring; no pet policy also suggests strict landlord. No elevator info confirmed - being top floor of what may be an older walkup could be difficult with a stroller and baby."}
