{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern laminate flooring, updated kitchen with gas stove and range hood, and a clean renovated bathroom with glass shower partition. The living area has stylish decor with accent wall and modern AC unit. Baby safety concerns: the hallway photo shows a gate/railing that could be a staircase barrier, exposed pipes run along the ceiling in the living room, and the narrow hallway has limited natural light (windows appear small). Being on 2F of a 4F walkup with no elevator could be challenging with a stroller. Overall clean and well-maintained but natural light appears limited based on the photos."}
