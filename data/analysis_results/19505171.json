{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a duplex/loft-style apartment with an internal spiral staircase connecting two levels, which is a major baby safety concern — the open staircase has no gate, wide gaps between steps, and wrought-iron railings a child could slip through. The glass display shelves with sharp edges also pose risks. The unit appears clean with modern finishes (recessed lighting, glossy tile floors, glass backsplash kitchen, tiled soaking tub bathroom), but the living area appears to have limited natural light with heavy curtains drawn, and the overall aesthetic feels somewhat dated-trendy with dark furniture and textured wallpaper. The kitchen is compact but functional, and the bathroom has a built-in soaking tub with a gas water heater."}
