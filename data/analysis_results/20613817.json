{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very high-end boutique hotel-style studio with premium finishes, recessed lighting, built-in kitchenette, glass-enclosed bathroom, and modern furniture. The unit is immaculately clean with good natural light from French-style balcony doors, but at only 8.6 ping it is extremely small for a couple with a baby. The balcony has decorative iron railings that a toddler could potentially reach through, and the glass bathroom partition poses a safety concern; the open-plan layout with no separate bedroom makes it feel more like a serviced apartment than a family home, and at NT$80,000/month it is very expensive for the size."}
