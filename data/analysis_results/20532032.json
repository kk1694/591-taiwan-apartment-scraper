{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Older apartment in a typical Taipei walk-up building (2F of 9F, likely no elevator based on building exterior). The living area is spacious with tiled floors and a bar counter but feels dated with worn furnishings and a cluttered bedroom. The balcony shows significant aging with peeling walls, stacked clutter, and a low railing that is a serious baby safety concern. The bathroom has a glass shower partition with hard edges. Natural light appears limited in interior rooms. Overall the unit needs deep cleaning and the balcony area would require child-proofing before being suitable for a family with a baby."}
