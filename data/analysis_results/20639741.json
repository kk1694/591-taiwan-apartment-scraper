{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and clean modern apartment in a 14-floor building in Beitou with bright living room featuring large sliding glass doors to a balcony, split AC units, and furnished bedrooms with matching light wood furniture. The balcony has glass railings which are a safety concern for a baby/toddler and should be checked for adequate height; the glass-topped coffee table with sharp metal corners is also a hazard. Excellent natural light throughout, tile floors are easy to clean, and at 57.8 ping the space is very generous for a growing family."}
