{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and well-furnished apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). Clean, stylish interior with wood-tone flooring, modern kitchen, large TV, comfortable sofa, and a separate bedroom with built-in wardrobes and desk. The balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass sliding doors providing excellent natural light, with railings that appear adequate but the balcony door gap should be baby-proofed; the coffee table has rounded edges which is a plus, and the overall layout is flat and open with no stairs. At 18 ping with a 12-story building on floor 4, an elevator is very likely."}
