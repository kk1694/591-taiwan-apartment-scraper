{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "The apartment is on the top floor (10/10) in Datong district with decent size at 25.75 ping. Interior has dated built-in cabinetry and wallpaper from an older renovation, with a basic kitchenette area lacking a proper sink or stove (only plastic basins visible). The living area has a built-in media wall with projector screen track and ambient lighting, and the bedroom has a double bed with wall-mounted AC. For baby safety, the windows appear to have secure frames but low window sills in the living area could be a concern; exposed wiring behind the TV cabinet and accessible cabinet doors with knobs at toddler height are potential hazards. Being on the top floor may mean heat issues in summer and potential roof leaks; the description is a generic agent promotion rather than an actual property description, which is a red flag."}
