{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment in a 15-floor building with recessed lighting, central AC, video intercom, and clean tile floors. The living room has a balcony with metal railings that appear adequately spaced but should be checked for baby safety; the kitchen has a breakfast bar with high stools that could be a tipping hazard for a toddler. Good natural light from multiple windows, spacious 24-ping layout with bedroom and built-in closet; overall very clean and move-in ready condition with LG appliances."}
