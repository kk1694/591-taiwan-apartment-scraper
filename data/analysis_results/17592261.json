{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with new wood-grain flooring, recessed lighting, modern AC units, and clean white walls throughout. The 3-bedroom layout on 5F/11F is spacious at 42 ping with good natural light from multiple windows; the balcony has metal railings visible through sliding doors which would need child safety locks, and exposed electrical outlets at floor level should be covered for baby safety. The unit is very clean with no visible red flags, though being completely unfurnished means additional setup costs; the building likely has an elevator given it is 11 floors."}
