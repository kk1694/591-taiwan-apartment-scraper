{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean tile floors, recessed LED lighting, built-in wooden cabinetry, and two bedrooms with ample natural light from large windows. The glass coffee table in the living room and glass shower partition in the bathroom pose baby safety concerns; the second bedroom appears to have balcony access with a sliding glass door that would need childproofing. Overall the unit is spacious at 23 ping, very clean, and in excellent condition — a strong option for a young family in Zhongshan District."}
