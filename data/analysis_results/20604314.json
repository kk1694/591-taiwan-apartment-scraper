{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated unfurnished apartment with polished marble-look tile floors, modern dark wood doors, and a clean kitchen with gas stove and new cabinetry. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agency). The unit is completely empty with no furniture, which means you'll need to furnish it entirely; for baby safety, the flat tile floors are smooth and easy to clean but slippery, and the lack of visible balcony railings or stairs in photos is a positive sign. Natural light appears limited with only small windows visible, and at 4F/5F in a walk-up building the lack of elevator could be challenging with a stroller and baby."}
