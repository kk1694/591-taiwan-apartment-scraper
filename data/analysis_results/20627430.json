{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment (36.5 ping) on 8F/14F with hardwood floors throughout, dated 1990s-era decor including glass block partition wall, older light fixtures, and window-unit AC in bedrooms. At least two bedrooms with en-suite bathroom visible; plenty of room for a growing family. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners, the balcony door in the living room needs childproofing, and some wall paint shows minor wear/peeling near windows. Good natural light from multiple windows on higher floor. The description is essentially empty (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a red flag — request full details and an in-person visit before committing at NT$78,000/month."}
