{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, well-maintained unfurnished apartment with polished hardwood floors throughout, recessed lighting, AC units, and an intercom system. The unit appears spacious at ~28 ping with multiple rooms, a balcony with sliding glass doors (baby safety concern - balcony access needs childproofing), and decent natural light from large windows with blinds. Being on the 6th floor of a 16-story building strongly suggests elevator access; the overall condition is good with clean white walls and no visible damage, though the unit is completely empty so furniture/appliances would need to be provided."}
