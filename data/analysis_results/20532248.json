{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Very spacious and modern apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile flooring, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light and mountain views. The open-plan living area is very clean with minimal furnishing (L-shaped sofa, dining set), which is great for baby-proofing. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent), the 11th floor unit in an 18-story building is well-suited for a family; the large windows appear to have secure framing but curtain cords should be checked for baby safety."}
