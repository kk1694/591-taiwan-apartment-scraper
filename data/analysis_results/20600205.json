{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Ren'ai Yi Di (仁愛壹邸), Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Very modern and stylishly renovated unit with recessed lighting, sleek built-in cabinetry, glass-panel bathroom, and integrated washer. The space appears compact despite the 20-ping listing; it looks more like a well-designed studio or 1-bedroom, which may feel tight for a couple with a baby. Baby safety concerns include the raised platform seating area with hard edges, the glass shower enclosure, and open shelving with decorative items at low heights. Natural light seems limited with zebra blinds covering what appears to be the only window/balcony door."}
