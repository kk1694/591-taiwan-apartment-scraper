The unit appears very clean with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows and a balcony with secure railings. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout, glass coffee table edges, and balcony access would need childproofing; the interior stairs visible in images suggest this may be a duplex unit which presents additional safety concerns for a crawling baby."}
