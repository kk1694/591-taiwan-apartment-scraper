{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "This is a large 39 ping apartment on the 10th floor of a 15-story building in Zhongshan District, priced at NT$100,000/month. The listing description is essentially empty, containing only a generic advertisement for the agent's services rather than actual property details, which is a red flag suggesting minimal effort from the listing agent. Without photos or a meaningful description, it is impossible to assess modernity, baby safety features, natural light, or overall condition; further investigation or an in-person visit is strongly recommended before considering this property."}
