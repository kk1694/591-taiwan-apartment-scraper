{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Well-renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including light wood laminate flooring, recessed and cove lighting, marble TV feature wall, and built-in cabinetry throughout. The living room has large floor-to-ceiling grid windows providing good natural light, and rooms are spacious at 50 ping. For baby safety, the large windows in the living room have low sills that would need child locks or barriers, and there are some sharp corners on built-in furniture edges to pad. The apartment appears very clean and move-in ready, though the listing description is minimal (agent promotional text only), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout, kitchen, and bathroom condition."}
