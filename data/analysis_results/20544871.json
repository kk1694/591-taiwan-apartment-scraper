{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Older walk-up apartment on 3F/3F with recently repainted white walls and vinyl plank flooring over original surfaces, but the building itself is clearly aged with old-style sliding glass doors with diamond-pattern security grilles, exposed conduit wiring, and dated window frames. The flooring appears worn and dirty in places, and one bedroom has old parquet tile flooring with a basic bed frame. Being a top-floor walk-up with no elevator is a significant concern for a couple expecting a baby (carrying stroller/baby up 3 flights); the frosted/textured windows limit natural light, and the overall condition feels like a superficial refresh of an old unit rather than a genuine renovation."}
