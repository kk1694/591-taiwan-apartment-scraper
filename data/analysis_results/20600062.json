{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment with light wood floors and multiple bedrooms with AC units. Currently appears to be mid-renovation or recently vacated with debris and cleaning supplies on the floor. For baby safety, the bedroom has a balcony with floor-to-ceiling sliding doors that would need childproofing; some visible water staining on ceilings suggests potential moisture issues. Good natural light from multiple windows but the somewhat dated fixtures and current messy condition suggest it needs thorough cleaning before move-in."}
