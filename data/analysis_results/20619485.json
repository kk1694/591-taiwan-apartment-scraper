{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment (36 ping) with hardwood floors, recessed lighting, AC units, and large windows providing decent natural light. Furniture is dated but the space is clean and well-maintained. Being on the 2nd floor of a 4-story walkup building means no elevator and stairs to navigate, which is a concern with a baby and stroller; the coffee table has sharp marble corners and the hardwood floors, while nice, can be slippery — baby-proofing would be needed. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag suggesting this may be a generic broker listing with limited detail."}
