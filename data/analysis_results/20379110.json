{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, upscale apartment with modern finishes including crystal chandeliers, large L-shaped leather sofa, formal dining area, and luxurious marble-tiled bathroom with separate tub and shower. Floor on 8F of 14F building strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety: hard tile floors throughout require rugs/padding, coffee table has sharp corners that need covers, and the balcony doors visible in living room will need child locks. Generally clean and well-maintained with good natural light from large windows."}
