{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older apartment with dated fixtures including window AC units, older-style tile flooring, and basic ceiling light fixtures. The space is clean but clearly showing its age with some wall marks and exposed wiring. For baby safety, the unit appears relatively safe with no visible stairs or balconies, though the dark security door entrance and exposed cables along baseboards would need attention. Natural light appears limited due to frosted/tinted windows."}
