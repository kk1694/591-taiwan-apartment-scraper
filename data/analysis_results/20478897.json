{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large spacious apartment with dated fixtures and mixed flooring styles across rooms (marble, wood laminate). The unit appears clean but has older AC units and traditional chandeliers. For baby safety, the balcony railings visible in image 2 appear adequate height but would need verification; the polished marble floors in the living areas could be slippery. Excellent natural light from large windows with mountain/greenery views."}
