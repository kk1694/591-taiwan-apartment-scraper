{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District, near a traditional temple visible from window", "notes": "Lavishly decorated apartment with ornate European-style furnishings, crystal chandeliers, baroque patterned sofas, and heavy wood cabinetry — well-maintained but dated/gaudy aesthetic rather than modern. The glass coffee table with sharp corners and hard tile/wood flooring are baby safety concerns; the 2F/4F walkup in an older building likely has no elevator, which is difficult with a stroller. Good natural light from large windows overlooking what appears to be a traditional temple, and the 38 ping size is spacious, but the heavy decorative style and glass elements would need baby-proofing."}
