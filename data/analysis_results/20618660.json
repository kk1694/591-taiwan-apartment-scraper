{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with light wood cabinetry, recessed lighting, and split AC units in multiple rooms. The unit has at least two bedrooms with balcony access through sliding glass doors; the balcony has glass railings which could be a baby safety concern and would need childproofing. Good natural light from large windows, tiled floors throughout, and the overall condition appears excellent with freshly painted walls."}
