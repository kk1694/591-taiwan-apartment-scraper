{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with open-plan living area, sleek kitchen island with bar seating, and contemporary finishes. The unit features good natural light from large windows with greenery views, wood laminate flooring, and a clean bathroom with glass shower enclosure. Baby safety concerns include the high bar stools at the kitchen island, the exterior entrance area with steps visible, and the outdoor laundry space with exposed water heater - balcony/outdoor areas would need childproofing."}
