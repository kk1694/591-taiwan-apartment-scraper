{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "安和仁愛 (Anhe Ren'ai area), Beitou District", "notes": "Brand new, unfurnished apartment in a modern high-rise (27-floor) building with exposed ceiling pipes giving a loft-style feel. Very clean with polished tile floors, modern bathroom with glass shower enclosure and stone countertop. The unit is completely empty which is good for baby-proofing from scratch, but note the exposed ceiling pipes and the slippery polished tile floors could be concerns. Good natural light from large windows in the bedrooms; no balcony visible which is actually safer for a child, but the glass shower door edges would need attention as the baby grows."}
