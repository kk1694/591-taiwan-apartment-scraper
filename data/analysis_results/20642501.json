{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious and clean apartment at 83.9 ping with polished marble floors in the living area and warm wood flooring in the large master bedroom. The kitchen is well-equipped with granite countertops, gas stove, range hood, and a separate enclosed layout which is good for baby safety. For baby concerns, the slippery marble tile floors in the living room could be a hazard for crawling/walking toddlers, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows near the balcony would need childproofing; however the overall open layout with minimal sharp corners is favorable. Listed through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency (a foreigner-friendly agency), the unit on the 6th floor of a 14-story building almost certainly has an elevator, and has good natural light from large windows."}
