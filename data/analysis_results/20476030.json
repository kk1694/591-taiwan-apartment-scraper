{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern white cabinetry, herringbone tile backsplash, open kitchen with peninsula counter, and elegant wainscoting in the bedroom. Very clean condition with quality wooden furniture, split AC, and good natural light from large bedroom windows. For baby safety, the kitchen is open-plan with accessible lower cabinets and glass shelving that would need childproofing; no balcony or stairs visible, and corners on furniture are relatively rounded, though the glass shelf unit near the kitchen should be secured. Being on 6F of a 7-story building without confirmed elevator could be a concern with a stroller."}
