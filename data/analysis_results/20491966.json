{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "Luxury high-rise apartment on the 25th floor with premium finishes including marble feature walls, dark wood paneling, designer lighting, and high-end furniture. Excellent natural light with panoramic city and mountain views through large windows. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows need childproofing, and the sharp-edged coffee table and hard marble/stone surfaces in the entryway pose bump risks. The unit is very clean, spacious at 70 ping, and in excellent condition — a top-tier modern apartment, though the listing description is minimal (appears to be an agent-posted sale package ad rather than a detailed rental listing, which is a minor red flag worth verifying)."}
