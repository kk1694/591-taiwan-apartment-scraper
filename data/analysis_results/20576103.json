{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated open-plan space with modern track lighting, white kitchen island with gas stove, laminate wood flooring, and glass-partitioned bathroom area. Major baby safety concerns: the bedroom has a loft bed with a ladder and open railing that poses a serious fall hazard, and the space has an industrial/commercial feel with exposed ceiling pipes and very sparse furnishing — it may be a converted commercial unit rather than a standard residential apartment. The 48.55 ping size at NT$65,000 in Datong seems underpriced, and the description is just a generic agent ad with no real details, which is a red flag."}
