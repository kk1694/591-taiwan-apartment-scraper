{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Unfurnished older apartment with freshly painted white walls but dated black-and-white marble-pattern tile flooring and older green tile in one room. Rooms are spacious with multiple windows (frosted glass limits natural light), wall-mounted AC units, and an attached bathroom visible. The hard tile floors could be slippery for a crawling baby, and the completely empty/unfurnished state means everything would need to be purchased; being on 3F of a 5F walkup with no visible elevator is a concern for carrying a stroller and baby gear up stairs."}
