{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Modern, clean apartment on the 14th floor with light wood laminate flooring, floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light, open kitchen with breakfast bar, AC, and a separate bedroom. Baby safety concerns include the balcony with sliding glass doors on a high floor (14F), an open metal ladder/shelving unit with climbable rungs, and tall bar stools that could tip; the space is otherwise clean with no sharp corners. The listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — worth confirming actual layout and amenities in person."}
