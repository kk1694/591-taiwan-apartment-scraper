{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new renovation with modern finishes including recessed lighting, light wood laminate flooring, and clean white walls. Very spacious open layout at 29 ping with multiple rooms visible. For baby safety: floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors lead to balcony (will need child locks), no visible stairs, corners appear rounded. Unfurnished unit is extremely clean but lacks natural light in photos (taken at night). Windows are positioned high on walls which may limit daylight."}
