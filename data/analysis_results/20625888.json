{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylish studio-style apartment with high-end built-in cabinetry, murphy bed, digital door lock, AC, and a loft/mezzanine level accessed by a metal ladder. Significant baby safety concerns: the open loft with metal ladder and railing is dangerous for a crawling baby or toddler, and the space is quite compact at 13 ping for a couple with a baby. Good natural light from balcony-side windows, and the unit is very clean and well-maintained, but the fold-out bed and multi-level layout make this impractical for a family with an infant."}
