{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, polished tile floors, and contemporary finishes. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony with sliding glass doors should be checked for secure child locks. Good natural light from large windows, very clean, and the 15-story building almost certainly has an elevator."}
