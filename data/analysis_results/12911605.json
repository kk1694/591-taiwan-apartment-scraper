{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a former office space, not a residential apartment. It has commercial-grade drop ceiling tiles, fluorescent panel lighting, office carpet flooring, and partitioned rooms with interior windows typical of an office layout. The kitchen and bathroom are very basic and dated with stained walls and worn fixtures. Major red flags for a couple expecting a baby: the space would require significant conversion to be livable as a residence, there are exposed wires on the floor, water stains suggesting moisture issues, and the overall condition is quite run-down and not suitable for a family with an infant."}
