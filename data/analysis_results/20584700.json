{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "環球大廈 (Huanqiu Building), #336-344", "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures and traditional styling including wood-framed glass doors. The building lobby appears well-maintained with a chandelier. Interior shows hardwood floors and recessed lighting but overall 1990s-2000s aesthetic. Baby safety concerns include glass panel doors at child height and open kitchen bar area; no visible balcony hazards in photos. Spacious at 40 ping with decent natural light visible through windows."}
