{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with polished tile floors, recessed ceiling AC, and quality kitchen with gas stove and built-in cabinetry. Spacious open layout with sliding doors and built-in wardrobes. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout and sharp black trim baseboards may need padding; no visible balcony railings or stairs in images. Being 1F in a 13-story building means easy access but potentially less natural light from upper floors."}
