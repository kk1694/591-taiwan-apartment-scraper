{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in Da'an with clean white walls, modern track lighting, new tile flooring, and contemporary furniture. The living room has large windows with good natural light and roller blinds. The space is spacious at 27 ping with a separate dining area, kitchen behind glass doors, and at least one bedroom with built-in wardrobe. For baby safety, the floors are smooth tile (slippery risk), the bathroom has a black-and-white checkered step-down entry, and being on 2F of a 4F walk-up means stair access only with no elevator — manageable but inconvenient with a stroller. No visible balcony hazards but the bedroom window has security bars which is a plus."}
