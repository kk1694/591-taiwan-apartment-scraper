{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua, near a school with running track", "notes": "Brand new or nearly new construction, completely unfurnished with pristine white walls, polished tile floors, and modern black-framed windows. The 13th floor unit has excellent natural light and panoramic city/mountain views overlooking a school campus. For baby safety, the high floor (13F) with large windows is a concern—ensure windows have child locks; no balcony or stairs visible which is good. The unit is very clean but completely empty (no kitchen or appliances visible), and the exposed ceiling pipes in the living area suggest it may be delivered as a bare shell requiring tenant fit-out, which could be a significant cost consideration at NT$90,000/month."}
