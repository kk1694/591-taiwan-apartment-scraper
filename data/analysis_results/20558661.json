{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very stylish, recently renovated apartment with modern kitchen, marble-look finishes, barn-door style sliding doors, large TV, and recessed lighting. The unit appears to be a loft/duplex style with stairs visible in image 1, which is a significant baby safety concern — stairs will need gating. Good natural light from large windows. The open kitchen with island counter has some sharp corners to watch for. Overall clean and well-maintained, managed by UR HOUSE rental agency. At 5F with no elevator info, carrying a stroller could be challenging if no elevator."}
