{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment with dark hardwood floors showing some wear, dated kitchen with open-counter style and older cabinetry, and an aging bathroom with bathtub and glass shelves. The unit is spacious at 71.56 ping with decent natural light from balcony sliding doors, but fixtures and finishes appear to be from the 1990s-2000s era. For baby safety, the bathtub lacks a guard, the glass kitchen shelves could be hazardous, and the balcony access door should be checked for secure child locks; the hardwood floors are slippery and the raised bathroom step is a tripping concern."}
