{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern apartment with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Features include hardwood floors, recessed lighting, modern kitchen with gas stove and dishwasher, and a clean bathroom with bathtub. For baby safety: the balcony door rails appear secure but would need child locks; furniture has some sharp corners (coffee table, shelving units) that may need padding; the open floor plan is good for visibility but low outlets are visible throughout."}
