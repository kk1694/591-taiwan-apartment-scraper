{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, modern track lighting, grey tile flooring throughout, wall-mounted AC units, and a nicely updated bathroom with glass partition. At 31 ping on 3F of a 5-story walkup building (no elevator likely), carrying a stroller and baby up stairs daily would be a concern. The space is very clean with no sharp corners visible, good natural light from windows, and the open layout is baby-friendly, though the wet bathroom floor design requires caution with a crawling child."}
