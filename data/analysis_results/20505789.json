{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained living room with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed LED ceiling lighting, large leather sectional sofa, and polished tile floors. The apartment appears clean and in good condition with ceiling-mounted AC. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need padding, and the glass sliding doors between rooms could be a concern; however, the open floor plan with smooth tile flooring provides ample crawling space. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad), so details on bedrooms, kitchen, and bathrooms are unavailable from these images alone."}
