{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with polished marble floors, recessed lighting, and central AC. The space is very clean with good natural light from multiple windows. Modern kitchen with green cabinets and full-size refrigerator included. For baby safety, the floors are slippery marble which could be a concern for crawling/walking toddlers, and the balcony access door should be secured. The open floor plan with no visible stairs is good for child safety."}
