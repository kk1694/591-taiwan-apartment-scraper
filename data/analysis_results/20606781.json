{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated apartment with modern laminate flooring, recessed LED lighting, fresh paint (including accent green wall), and new split AC units in each room. Very clean condition with no visible hazards - no balconies shown, windows have security grilles, and rooms have smooth corners. However, the building exterior shows an older low-rise walkup (3F/4F) typical of Neihu residential lanes, and some windows face other buildings closely, limiting natural light in certain rooms."}
