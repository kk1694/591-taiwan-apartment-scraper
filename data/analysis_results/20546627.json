{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu Road Section 2 (內湖路二段), 友座君碧 community, 471m from Neihu MRT Station", "notes": "Brand new 1-year-old green-certified building with recent million-dollar renovation and modern appliances. Excellent for a family with baby - building has children's play area, reading room, and 24-hour security. Southeast-facing unit should provide good natural light. No obvious safety red flags; as a newer high-rise with elevator, the unit likely has modern balcony railings and standard safety features."}
