{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, newly renovated studio apartment with modern marble-look tile flooring, split AC, smart TV, and minimalist furnishings. The balcony has secure floor-to-ceiling railings which is good for baby safety, though the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. Good natural light from large sliding glass doors. Being on 6F of a 15-floor building strongly suggests elevator access."}
