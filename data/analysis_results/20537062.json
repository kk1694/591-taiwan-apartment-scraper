{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older building with dated furniture and fixtures including burgundy leather sofas and dark wood furnishings. The apartment is spacious with good natural light from balcony windows, laminate flooring, and recessed lighting. For baby safety, the balcony visible in image 3 has railings that would need child-proofing, and the coffee table has sharp corners. Overall clean but showing age, typical of older Taiwan residential buildings."}
