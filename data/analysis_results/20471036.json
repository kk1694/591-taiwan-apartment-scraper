{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment with high-end finishes including built-in TV wall unit, sleek white kitchen with glass backsplash, light wood laminate flooring, and split AC units throughout. Listed by Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), on 11F of a 16-floor building with good natural light and city views. The glass partition near the living room and the raised tatami-style platform in the second bedroom have edges that could be minor baby safety concerns, but overall the unit has smooth surfaces and no visible balcony access, which is positive for child safety. Very clean and move-in ready condition with ample built-in storage."}
