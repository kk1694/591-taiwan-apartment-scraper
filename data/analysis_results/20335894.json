{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious 3-bedroom apartment with dated but clean condition. The living area has older window-unit AC and an enclosed balcony with security grilles. The laminate flooring and recessed lighting are reasonably maintained, but the furniture and appliances appear older. For baby safety, the enclosed balcony with metal security grilles is positive, and the open floor plan has minimal sharp corners, though the glass coffee table could be a concern. Natural light appears limited due to the enclosed balcony blocking direct sunlight."}
