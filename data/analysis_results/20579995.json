{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei Metro The Mall (環球購物中心), Da'an District", "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated but clean furnishings — hardwood floors, leather sofas, wooden built-in wardrobes, and traditional light fixtures suggest 1990s-2000s era decor. The glass-top coffee table with sharp corners and the balcony with sliding door access are baby safety concerns; the exposed TV cables on the bedroom wall are also worth noting. Good natural light from multiple windows with security grilles, spacious 46-ping layout with at least two bedrooms, and the view directly overlooks Taipei Metro The Mall shopping center, indicating an excellent convenient location. Being on floor 8 of 17 strongly suggests elevator access."}
