{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern loft-style duplex apartment with high ceilings, stylish fixtures, wood-look flooring, and contemporary furniture managed by Miller House. The interior stairs leading to the mezzanine/loft level are a significant baby safety concern as they appear open without gates, and the balcony has glass railings with metal rails that a toddler could potentially climb. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access; the unit is clean and well-maintained but the split-level layout with exposed stairs makes it less ideal for a family with a baby."}
