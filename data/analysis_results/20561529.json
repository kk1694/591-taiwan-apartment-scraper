{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Large 48-ping unfurnished apartment in good clean condition but with older-style finishes — classic chandeliers, marble-look tile floors, and dark wood door trim suggest a 1990s-2000s era building rather than modern renovation. The kitchen is a galley-style with white cabinetry and built-in appliances, and bedrooms have hardwood flooring with built-in shelving and AC. For baby safety, the polished tile floors in the living area are very slippery, the balcony has sliding glass doors that should be checked for secure locks, and the entryway has a raised marble step that could be a tripping hazard. Being on the 8th floor of a 12-story building strongly suggests elevator access; the unit is spacious with decent natural light from windows and a balcony, and is managed by UR House (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), which is a plus for non-Chinese-speaking tenants."}
