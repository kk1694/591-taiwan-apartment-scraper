{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment in clean, well-maintained condition with polished tile floors, multiple split AC units, and a digital door lock. The unit has good natural light through large windows with mountain views, an open kitchen with built-in cabinetry, and at least two bedrooms. For baby safety, the tile floors are smooth and easy to clean but slippery; no visible balcony railings or stairs to worry about, and corners appear rounded. One bedroom window faces close to an adjacent building which may reduce light; the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — ask for more details on layout and amenities."}
