{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained modern apartment at 61.6 ping with clean white tile floors, modern kitchen with full cabinetry and gas stove, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. The open living/dining layout is baby-friendly with no visible stairs or sharp corners, though the large windows in the living room and bedroom would need child locks; the bedroom has dark hardwood flooring and the unit appears to be in a newer high-rise building (8F/12F, likely with elevator). The listing description is minimal (just an agent promotion), which is a minor red flag — more details about the layout and amenities would be expected for a unit at this price point."}
