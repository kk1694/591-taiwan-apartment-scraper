{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with glossy white tile floors, recessed lighting, split AC units in each room, and a well-equipped kitchen with gas stove, range hood, refrigerator, and washing machine. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent), which suggests foreigner-friendly. The open-plan living area has smooth floors that could be slippery for a crawling baby; the tile floors and sharp kitchen counter corners are minor baby-safety concerns, but the flat single-floor layout with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access is a plus. At 33 ping with two bedrooms, ample built-in storage, and a 10-story building (very likely to have an elevator), this is a spacious and suitable option for a couple expecting a baby."}
