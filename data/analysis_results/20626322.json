{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, professionally designed apartment with dark hardwood floors, marble-style accents, and elegant white wainscoting throughout. The living room has a raised platform area near the window which could be a fall hazard for a crawling baby, and the sunken Japanese-style dining area with a recessed table also poses a tripping/falling concern. Good natural light through venetian blinds and zebra blinds; the bedroom is well-furnished with a window seat, but the glass-front display cabinets in the living room would need child-proofing."}
