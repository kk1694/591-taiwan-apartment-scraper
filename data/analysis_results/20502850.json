{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious apartment (51 ping) with clean white flooring and updated track lighting, but overall style is dated with older-style furniture and fixtures. The bathroom shows wear with aged tiles and bathtub. For baby safety: the large open floor plan is good, but windows have metal security grilles which could pose climbing hazards when baby becomes mobile. Good natural light from multiple windows."}
