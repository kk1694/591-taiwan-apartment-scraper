The unit features a spacious open-plan living area with good natural light, a modern kitchen with updated appliances, and appears to be on a high floor (22F) in a building that certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the balcony visible in image 1 has railings that may need child-proofing; no stairs visible. Overall very clean and well-maintained, suitable for a family."}
