{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with clean white tile floors, new kitchen cabinets with built-in microwave and range hood, and split AC units. The unit appears well-maintained in a newer high-rise building (7F/21F suggests elevator). For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors should be secured; floors are smooth tile which is easy to clean but can be slippery. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows in bedrooms."}
