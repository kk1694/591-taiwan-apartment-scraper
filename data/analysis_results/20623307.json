{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern building with clean, newly renovated interior featuring polished tile floors, fresh white walls, dark baseboards, and black-framed windows with curtains throughout multiple rooms. The building exterior appears relatively new (7+ stories with elevator likely given modern construction). Unfurnished unit at 50 ping is spacious with good natural light from multiple windows in each room; the smooth tile floors could be slippery for a crawling baby but no visible stairs, sharp corners, or dangerous balcony access — the balcony railings on the exterior appear to have adequate horizontal bar spacing. Red flag: listing description is very sparse (just a generic agent promotion message) with no details about layout, amenities, or lease terms, and the unit is completely empty with no kitchen or bathroom photos shown."}
