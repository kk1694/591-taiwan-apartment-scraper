{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated apartment with modern minimalist design, high-quality fixtures including designer pendant lights, split AC, and built-in cabinetry. The space is very clean with smooth corners on furniture and no visible balcony access, making it relatively baby-safe. Good natural light through large windows with blinds; being on floor 3 of 14 strongly suggests elevator access in this modern building."}
