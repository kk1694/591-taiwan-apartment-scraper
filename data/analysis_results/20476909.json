Images show a warehouse-like area with metal roll-up shutters, concrete floors, industrial shelving, and what looks like a covered courtyard or patio area. Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby - no proper living spaces visible, dirty concrete floors, industrial equipment, and no residential amenities shown. This listing should be skipped."}
