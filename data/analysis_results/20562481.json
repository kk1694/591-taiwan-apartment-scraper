{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with clean white interiors, light wood flooring, modern blinds, and updated bathroom with rain shower. Building has a gym facility suggesting a managed complex with elevator. Major concern: there is active construction on an adjacent building (visible scaffolding and blue netting from balcony), which means noise and dust issues. Balcony railings have horizontal bars that a toddler could climb, and the balcony gap spacing needs checking for baby safety. The bedroom shown has a small folding bed rather than a proper bed, and built-in shelving with open cubby holes that could tip if climbed on by a child."}
