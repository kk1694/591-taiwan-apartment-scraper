{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new, very modern studio/1-room apartment in Xinyi with high-end finishes including built-in oven, microwave, gas stovetop, glass backsplash kitchen, recessed lighting, and stylish geometric accent walls. The unit is unfurnished and extremely clean with light wood-look flooring and a contemporary bathroom; at 13.8 ping it is compact for a couple with a baby. No visible balcony or windows in the photos raises concerns about natural light and ventilation; the open kitchen layout means baby-proofing the oven and stovetop area would be essential. Building is 13 floors so almost certainly has an elevator."}
