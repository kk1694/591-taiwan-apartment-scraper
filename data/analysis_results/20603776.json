{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). Clean minimalist interior with updated fixtures, recessed lighting, large TV, modern kitchen with full-size Japanese fridge, gas stove, and microwave. The bedroom has a balcony/window area with security grilles which is good for baby safety, but the large freestanding floor mirror in the dining area and glass coffee tables in the living room pose tipping hazards for a crawling baby. Being on the top floor (12F/12F) may mean potential roof leak or heat issues; natural light appears decent from bedroom windows. Overall very clean and move-in ready condition at a reasonable price for Xinyi District at ~29 ping."}
