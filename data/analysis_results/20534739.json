{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, professionally renovated apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED cove lighting, venetian blinds, polished floors, built-in wood-panel cabinetry, and designer furniture. Listed through UR HOUSE agency (foreigner-friendly). Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows on multiple sides. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp edges and would need corner guards, but no visible balcony access or dangerous railings; windows appear to be fixed or secured. The space appears clean and well-maintained, though only the living/dining area is shown — no kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom photos, which is a red flag for a 28-ping unit at NT$78K."}
