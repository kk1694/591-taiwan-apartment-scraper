{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed lighting, clean white tile floors, and contemporary furniture. Large open living/dining area with multiple windows providing good natural light. The space appears clean and spacious at 48 ping. For baby safety: the glass partition near entry and sharp-cornered furniture (marble dining table, glass coffee table) would need childproofing. Being on floor 10 of 13 in this modern building strongly suggests elevator access."}
