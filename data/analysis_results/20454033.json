{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with contemporary finishes including track lighting, sleek cabinetry, and modern bathroom with walk-in shower. Good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: the kitchen has a small balcony/utility area with security bars which is good, but the open layout with accessible kitchen stove and minimal separation between cooking and living areas may need attention. Overall clean and well-maintained."}
