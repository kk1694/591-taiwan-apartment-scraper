{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with stylish marble-look wall tiles, crystal chandeliers, recessed lighting, and quality furniture. The space is clean with good natural light from a balcony with glass doors. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners and the balcony access with glass sliding doors would need childproofing; the internal staircase visible in images suggests this may be a duplex unit which poses fall risks for a crawling baby."}
