{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Tianmu, Shilin District", "notes": "Older apartment in Tianmu area with dated fixtures including ornate light fixtures, glass block walls, and 90s-style wooden flooring showing wear. The unit is spacious at 49 ping with a balcony visible through sliding glass doors with metal railings that appear adequately spaced for baby safety, though the sharp-cornered glass coffee table and low leather sofas would need childproofing. Natural light appears moderate from the balcony side; walls show some scuffing and the overall condition is fair but tired — listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a red flag suggesting limited transparency about the property."}
