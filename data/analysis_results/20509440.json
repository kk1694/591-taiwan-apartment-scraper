{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment with dated 1990s-style decor including decorative wood beam ceiling and older window AC units. The unit appears clean with good natural light from balcony windows, though the intercom and door show wear. For baby safety, the balcony has metal security grilles which are good, but exposed wires along baseboards in the wood-floored room need attention."}
