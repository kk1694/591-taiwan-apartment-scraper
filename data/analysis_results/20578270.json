{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with sleek minimalist design, recessed lighting, built-in kitchen with microwave and induction cooktop, and clean white cabinetry. Good for baby safety - no visible balcony access, no stairs, rounded furniture edges on sofa. The unit appears clean with good artificial lighting though natural light is limited (windows covered by floor-to-ceiling curtains). Building on 9th floor of 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
