{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a duplex/loft-style apartment with an internal staircase and high ceilings in Xinyi district. The unit has been renovated but with dated design choices (stone accent wall, older wood finishes). The internal staircase with open treads and no visible safety gate is a significant baby hazard, and the balcony railings appear to have wide enough gaps to be a concern. Kitchen is very compact with only a small induction cooktop integrated next to the washing machine, and the bathroom is modern with glass shower partition. Natural light is decent from the large balcony windows, but the loft layout with stairs makes this poorly suited for a family with a baby."}
