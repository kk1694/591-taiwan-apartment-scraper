The raised tatami platform and the circular cutout in the curved hallway wall are charming but the step-up to the tatami room and the open circular hole in the wall pose baby safety concerns. Being on 4F/4F with no elevator is a significant drawback for carrying a stroller and baby up four flights of stairs."}
