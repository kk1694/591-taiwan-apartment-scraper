{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern studio apartment in excellent condition with brand-new fixtures throughout: new bed (still in plastic wrap), modern L-shaped kitchen with glass backsplash and range hood, stylish bathroom with glass-enclosed shower, TOTO toilet, and washer/dryer combo. The space is very clean and well-designed with light wood flooring, recessed lighting, and a frosted glass room divider with mounted TV. For baby safety, the glass partition between bedroom and entryway has some sharp edges to watch, and the kitchen is narrow with no gate option; however, the flat layout with no stairs is a plus. Natural light appears moderate through zebra blinds in the bedroom; at 11 ping this is compact for a couple with a baby but the smart layout maximizes usable space."}
