{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment with double-height ceilings, recessed lighting, AC, wall-mounted TV, and clean tile flooring. The internal staircase with glass railing is a significant baby safety concern — the open glass panels and lack of a baby gate at the stairs pose a fall hazard, and the glass coffee table has sharp corners. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows; the unit appears clean and well-maintained with children's items already present (play mat, small stool), suggesting a family-friendly prior tenant."}
