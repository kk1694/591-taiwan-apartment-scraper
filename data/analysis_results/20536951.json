{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a multi-room apartment with at least 3 separate bedrooms shown, modern wood-look flooring throughout, and updated appliances including washer and dryer. Being on 1F of a 4-story building likely means no elevator. For baby safety, the open metal shelving unit with accessible items and raised dryer platform may need childproofing; the rooms appear clean with no major hazards visible but natural light seems limited with small windows."}
