{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern studio apartment with clean finishes, flat-screen TV, and updated fixtures including digital door lock and video intercom. The unit is well-maintained with good storage and a TECO refrigerator. For baby safety, the raised window platform could be a climbing hazard, and the glass shower door lacks baby-proofing; otherwise the space appears relatively safe with no visible stairs or dangerous railings. Natural light appears moderate from the window area."}
