{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment in Da'an with modern finishes including recessed lighting, stone accent wall, split AC units, and clean tile flooring throughout. Spacious living/dining area with L-shaped leather sofa, dining set, and built-in cabinetry; two bedrooms with good natural light and built-in wardrobes. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the tile floors are very smooth/slippery which could be a concern for a crawling toddler. Overall clean and move-in ready at 25 ping with decent window light, though the description is minimal (agent placeholder text only) which is a minor red flag — verify layout details and whether kitchen/bathroom are included."}
