{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with light wood flooring, clean white walls, and updated fixtures including split AC units. Spacious layout at 36.56 ping with multiple rooms suitable for a family. The bathroom appears older and cramped with standard fixtures; no obvious baby safety hazards like steep stairs visible, but low windows in bedrooms may need childproofing. Natural light appears limited based on nighttime photos."}
