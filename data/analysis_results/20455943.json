{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Watsons (Shilin)", "notes": "Older but well-maintained apartment with parquet wood flooring throughout. Spacious living and dining areas with good natural light. Windows have metal security grilles which are good for baby safety but the building appears to be an older walk-up (5F of 7F) with no visible elevator in exterior shot. Kitchen is galley-style with dated fixtures. The apartment is clean but has older-style window AC units and traditional decor."}
