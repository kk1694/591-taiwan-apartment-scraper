{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern minimalist design, recessed LED lighting, light wood-tone flooring, sleek white kitchen with induction cooktop, and updated bathroom with glass shower partition. The unit is very clean and in excellent condition. At 4F/14F in a 14-story building, an elevator is almost certain. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is a plus, but the glass shower door in the bathroom and sharp-cornered built-in furniture would need childproofing; natural light appears limited based on the photos with only small windows visible."}
