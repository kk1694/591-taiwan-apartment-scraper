{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment on 11F with internal staircase to mezzanine level. Clean white finishes, laminate wood flooring, induction cooktop, dishwasher, AC, and stylish furnishings. Major baby safety concern: the internal staircase has only a thin metal railing with glass panels and no gate, posing a significant fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler. The upper level bedroom has low ceilings and the loft ceiling height may feel cramped. Good natural light from windows on the high floor, but the low mezzanine ceiling and open staircase are red flags for a family with a baby."}
