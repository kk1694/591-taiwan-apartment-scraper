{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with sleek white cabinetry, integrated appliances (washer, microwave, stove), and clean minimalist design. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. For baby safety: the balcony has vertical railings which could be a concern, glass shower door in bathroom needs child-proofing, and open shelving/dining stools with sharp edges should be considered. Overall very clean and in excellent condition."}
