{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with high-end finishes including mosaic tile shower, vessel sink bathroom, induction cooktop, and front-loading washer. The unit appears to be a loft-style layout with a mezzanine sleeping area (low ceiling with storage cabinets) which is a major baby safety concern — the loft likely requires a ladder or steep stairs, and the low railing/edge would be dangerous for a crawling child. Being on 8F/8F (top floor) with no confirmed elevator is also a concern. The space is clean and bright but compact at 13.46 ping for a couple with a baby, and the glass bathroom doors have no locks visible, posing additional child safety issues."}
