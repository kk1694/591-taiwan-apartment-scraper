{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Spacious 52-ping apartment with a distinctive traditional Chinese aesthetic featuring dark wood floors, calligraphy wall art, wooden shutters, and classical-style furniture — well-maintained but dated rather than modern. The balcony has ornamental stone balusters that appear low and climbable, posing a safety concern for a toddler; the glass coffee table with metal edges is also a hazard. Good natural light from the balcony-facing windows; the kitchen is fully equipped with oven, gas stove, and ample cabinetry but the appliances and style look older. At 3F/10F the building likely has an elevator but this is not confirmed from the images or description."}
