{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, recently renovated apartment in a 21-story building with clean white tile floors, new kitchen with gas stove and modern cabinetry, and split AC units in multiple rooms. The unit appears to be subdivided into multiple small rooms (one with only a single bed), suggesting it may be configured as a shared apartment rather than a family unit — a potential red flag at this price point. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard but flat with no stairs visible; however, natural light appears very limited with small curtained windows, and the rooms feel narrow and confined, which would be challenging for a growing family."}
