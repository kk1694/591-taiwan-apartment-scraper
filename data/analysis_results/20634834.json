{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, and polished tile floors. The living room is bright with good natural light through security-grilled windows. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need padding, and the balcony/enclosed area visible through sliding doors should be checked for secure railings. Kitchen is galley-style with modern appliances including induction cooktop and large refrigerator; overall clean and move-in ready."}
