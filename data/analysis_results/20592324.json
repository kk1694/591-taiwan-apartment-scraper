{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan Minsheng area", "notes": "Brand new, boutique hotel-style apartment built by Japanese Panasonic construction with 4-meter high ceilings. Very modern with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, split AC, large windows providing good natural light, and a compact kitchenette. The large floor-to-ceiling windows on the 8th floor are a baby safety concern as railings appear low; furniture has some sharp corners on the coffee table and TV stand. The unit is clean and move-in ready but appears to be a studio/open layout which may feel cramped for a growing family despite the 20-ping size."}
