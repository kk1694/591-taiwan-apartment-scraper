{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale European-style interior with ornate crown molding, crystal chandelier, recessed lighting, and elegant glass-panel doors. The apartment is well-furnished with a white leather sofa, built-in wardrobes, vanity desk, glass display cabinets, flat-screen TV, central AC, washer/dryer, microwave, and induction cooktop. For baby safety, the glass doors with decorative metal frames and bead curtain dividers could be hazardous, and the glass shelving cabinets in the bedroom are a concern; however the layout is single-level with no stairs. Natural light appears limited as heavy drapes cover the windows, but overall the unit is clean and in excellent condition — though it feels more like a luxury hotel suite than a family home, and the compact kitchen area near the front door may be tight for daily family use."}
