{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with clean white walls, wood laminate flooring, track lighting, and split AC. The unit features an open layout with living/dining areas and large sliding doors to a balcony with decorative iron railings. For baby safety, the balcony railings have gaps that could be a concern for a crawling/walking child, and the large horizontal window opening in the living room would need a safety barrier. Good natural light from multiple windows and balcony access."}
