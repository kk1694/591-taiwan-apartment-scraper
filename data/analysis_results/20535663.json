{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very spacious older-style apartment (62 ping) with parquet wood flooring in living areas and tile in bedrooms; the unit is unfurnished and shows its age with dated ceiling cove lighting, older bathroom fixtures (purple basin sink, basic toilet), and worn flooring that would need refinishing. The large floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room provide good natural light, and there is a balcony with metal railings visible that would need baby-proofing; the open layout with no stairs is good for a baby but the bathroom floor appears slippery with smooth tile and the overall condition suggests significant cleaning and updating would be needed before move-in."}
