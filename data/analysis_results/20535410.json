{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Spacious 37-ping apartment with a mix of older and updated features — warm yellow accent walls, tatami-style sitting nook with wooden storage, built-in desk/shelving in the study room, and large sectional sofa in living area. The unit has good natural light from multiple windows with greenery views. For baby safety, the raised tatami platform has hard edges that would need corner guards, and the glass coffee table poses a concern; the tile floors are easy to clean but slippery. Overall the apartment is clean and well-maintained but has a slightly dated aesthetic typical of older Taiwanese buildings. The description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — no details on layout, amenities, or lease terms."}
