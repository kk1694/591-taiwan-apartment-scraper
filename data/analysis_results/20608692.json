{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Nanjing Fuxing MRT Station, Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very modern, hotel-like studio unit (room 305) with high-end minimalist finishes, recessed lighting, built-in wardrobe with sliding doors, and a compact kitchenette. The space is immaculately clean with good natural light from tall French-style windows. For baby safety, the unit is a single open-plan room on the 3rd floor with a small balcony visible behind the window — balcony railing style should be verified in person; the rounded furniture edges and flat flooring are positives, but at ~37 sqm this is a studio that may feel cramped for a couple with a baby. The watermark text '南京復興 305' indicates proximity to Nanjing Fuxing MRT, and the listing price of NT$90,000/month is very high for a studio of this size, suggesting a premium serviced-apartment style property."}
