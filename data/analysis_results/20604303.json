{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white tiled floors, contemporary furniture, and updated kitchen with induction cooktop and built-in oven. Good natural light through large windows with sheer curtains. For baby safety: furniture has some sharp corners on dining table and coffee table that would need padding, and the raised platform/step near the balcony area could be a tripping hazard for toddlers. Overall very clean and suitable for a family."}
