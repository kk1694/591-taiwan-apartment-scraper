{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with European-style white decor, crown molding, wall-mounted TVs, washing machine, and fitted kitchen. The unit appears to have a living area, at least one bedroom, and a bathroom with glass doors separating rooms. For baby safety, the glass sliding doors with decorative metal frames are a concern as a crawling child could bump into them; the marble-top coffee table has rounded edges which is slightly better but still hard; the bedroom window appears to have a small balcony or Juliet railing visible outside. Natural light seems limited to the bedroom window facing other buildings. At 7F/14F this is likely an elevator building, and the overall condition is very clean and well-maintained, though the all-white tile floors may be slippery."}
