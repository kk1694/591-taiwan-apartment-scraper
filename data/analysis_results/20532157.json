{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Large 65-ping apartment with a country/rustic European-style interior featuring exposed brick accents, wooden beam ceiling details, and antique-style furniture. The kitchen is nicely renovated with white cabinetry and a marble-topped island, but the living/dining area appears cluttered with boxes and miscellaneous items, suggesting it may be mid-move or poorly maintained. For baby safety, the open kitchen island corners and heavy antique furniture with sharp edges are concerns; natural light appears limited based on the photos, with most rooms relying on artificial lighting. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) at NT$90,000 which is high for Beitou, and the minimal listing description is a red flag."}
