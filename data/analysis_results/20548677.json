{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older, unfurnished ground-floor unit in Datong district that appears to be a converted shophouse or street-level space rather than a typical residential apartment — the large glass storefront doors with metal security grilles face directly onto the street where cars are parked, suggesting it may have been a commercial space. The interior is dated with peeling paint on walls, worn baseboards, an old basic kitchen with stained metal countertops, and the space is completely empty and unfurnished. For a couple with a baby, the ground-floor street access with no barrier, the generally poor condition, and the lack of natural light in the back rooms are concerns; however being on the first floor means no stair hazards."}
