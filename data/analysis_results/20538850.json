{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, hotel-style apartment with high-end finishes including recessed lighting, marble accent wall, split AC, and contemporary furniture. The space appears very clean with smooth surfaces and rounded coffee table edges that are relatively baby-safe, though the glass balcony doors visible in bedroom need childproofing. Natural light seems limited based on photos taken at night; the kitchenette is minimal but functional."}
