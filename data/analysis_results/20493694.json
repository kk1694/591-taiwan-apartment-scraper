{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Yongchun MRT Station (永春站)", "notes": "All images show exterior street views and nearby Yongchun MRT station - no interior photos available to assess condition, fixtures, or baby safety. The building appears to be an older 5-story walk-up without elevator (1F listing in a low-rise building). Location is excellent near MRT with Bank of Taiwan and mature tree-lined streets, but cannot evaluate interior modernness or safety features without interior photos."}
