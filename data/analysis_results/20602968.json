{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, large TV wall unit, and a well-equipped kitchen featuring a built-in oven, gas stovetop, and large refrigerator. The 7th floor unit in a 14-story building has good natural light from large windows with city views. For baby safety, the glass-front cabinets have reachable lower sections that may need childproofing, and the bedroom has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors that open to what appears to be a low balcony railing — this would need a safety check; the hard tile flooring in living areas and glass coffee table corners are also concerns for a crawling baby."}
