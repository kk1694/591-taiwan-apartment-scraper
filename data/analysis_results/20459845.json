{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, central AC, modern kitchen with black fixtures, and quality furniture. Good natural light in bedroom with city views. Baby safety considerations: no visible balcony hazards, rounded furniture edges on coffee table, but the glass sliding doors to the balcony and open kitchen area would need child-proofing once baby becomes mobile."}
