{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious unfurnished apartment in clean, modern condition with polished marble-look tile floors, wall-mounted AC units, and a sleek white modern kitchen with gas stove and range hood. The unit is on 5F of an 8F building (likely has elevator given the building style). The large open rooms have smooth floors and dark baseboards with no visible stairs or sharp hazards, though the completely empty unfurnished state means you would need to furnish everything; the kitchen has an adjacent balcony/laundry area with an open doorway that may need a baby gate. Good natural light from large windows in the living area, and overall the space is very clean and well-maintained."}
