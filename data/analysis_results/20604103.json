{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with modern finishes including new tile flooring, fresh white walls, updated kitchen cabinetry, modern bathroom with glass shower partition, and split AC units in multiple rooms. Very spacious at 73 ping with clean open layouts and no visible sharp corners or hazards, though the unit is completely empty so baby-proofing would depend on furniture choices. Natural light appears limited with small windows covered by blinds/curtains; being on 2F of a 7-story older building without confirmed elevator could be inconvenient with a stroller, and the listing is managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly agency) which may charge higher fees."}
