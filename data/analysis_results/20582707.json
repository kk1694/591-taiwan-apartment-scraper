{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Renovated apartment with new light wood laminate flooring, updated kitchen cabinetry, and modern light fixtures including a chandelier. The unit is completely unfurnished with a spacious open layout. Baby safety concerns include metal stair railings visible in image 2 that a toddler could climb, an elevated step near the kitchen/bathroom area in image 3, and exposed wiring on the floor. The rear area has a corrugated roof cover with an older exposed wall suggesting the building itself is aged despite interior renovation. At 2F in a 4-floor walkup, no elevator is expected. Natural light appears moderate from windows and glass doors."}
