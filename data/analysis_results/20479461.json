{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) with Japanese-style wood finishes throughout. Features include a spacious living room, modern kitchen with gas stove and large fridge, master bedroom, a smaller second bedroom with built-in platform bed and desk, and a unique Japanese-style sunken dining area (kotatsu-style) with raised platform. For baby safety, the raised tatami/platform dining area with sunken floor pit is a concern as a crawling baby could fall in; the large windows appear to have secure frames but window blinds cords should be checked. Being on 11F of a 13F building strongly suggests elevator access; the unit is very clean with good natural light from multiple large windows."}
