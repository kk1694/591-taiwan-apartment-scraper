{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean finishes, built-in wooden cabinetry, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture. The raised platform bedroom with retractable table presents a baby safety concern as a crawling child could fall from the elevated floor section. The space appears clean with good artificial lighting, though windows seem limited. Intercom system visible suggests a managed building."}
