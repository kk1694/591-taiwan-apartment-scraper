{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Renovated apartment in an older walkup building with modern built-in cabinetry, LED backlighting, polished tile floors, and a clean interior. Major baby safety concern: there is a visible internal staircase with metal railings (this appears to be a multi-level unit on 1F) and the building entrance requires climbing a long outdoor staircase, which would be very difficult with a stroller. Natural light appears limited in some rooms; one room has dark wood flooring with a glass-top desk suggesting it could serve as a study/bedroom, but no windows are visible in that room."}
