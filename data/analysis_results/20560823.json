{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "This is a ground-floor commercial/storefront space, NOT a residential apartment. The exterior shows a street-level shop with metal roll-up shutters, a 'for rent' sign, and a covered arcade walkway typical of Taiwanese shophouses. The interior has a dark painted ceiling with recessed lighting, worn wooden flooring with visible water damage, a counter-style partition, and an open front facing the street — clearly a former retail or restaurant space. The bathroom is extremely basic with rough unfinished walls, exposed pipes, and a simple toilet. Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby: no proper residential layout, no kitchen visible, open storefront entrance is a major safety hazard, poor hygiene conditions in the bathroom, and the commercial nature of the space means no proper living amenities."}
