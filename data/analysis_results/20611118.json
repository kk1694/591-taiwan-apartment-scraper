{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with polished marble-style tile floors, modern pendant lighting, and fresh paint. The unit appears very clean and move-in ready with multiple bedrooms visible. Kitchen has a gas stove and dishwasher. For baby safety, the hard tile floors may need rugs, and kitchen cabinets lack child locks. Natural light enters through zebra blinds but rooms appear somewhat dim. No bathroom or balcony images shown."}
