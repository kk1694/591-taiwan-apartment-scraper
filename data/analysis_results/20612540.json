{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Modern, well-furnished apartment listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) with clean contemporary finishes, LED ring light fixture, wall-mounted TV, AC, and two bathrooms (one with bathtub, one with glass-enclosed shower). The bedroom is compact with built-in bed frame and en-suite bathroom; a study nook with desk and zebra blinds provides a second room area. For baby safety, the bathtub will need supervision, the glass shower door has sharp edges at child height, and the bedroom appears tight for adding a crib. Being on 6F of a 14F building strongly suggests elevator access. Good natural light from large living room windows, and overall very clean condition with no visible red flags."}
