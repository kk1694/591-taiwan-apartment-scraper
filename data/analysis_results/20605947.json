{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an unfurnished apartment with a mix of renovated and older areas. The main living spaces have new light wood laminate flooring and fresh white paint, but the kitchen and one bedroom retain older finishes including dated tile flooring, an older-style gas stove, and dark hardwood floors with heavy old cabinets. The unit appears clean but completely empty with no furniture; the kitchen has a small rear balcony with security grilles. For baby safety, the open layout with no visible stairs is positive, but exposed floor-level electrical outlets throughout the living areas and the lack of any window guards in the bedroom are concerns. Natural light appears limited, with only small windows visible in the kitchen and one bedroom."}
