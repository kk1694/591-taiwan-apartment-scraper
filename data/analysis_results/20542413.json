{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, newly renovated apartment in clean condition with recessed lighting, split AC units, large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light, and contemporary furniture including a large TV, sofa, and dining area. The unit appears to have at least 2 bedrooms with matching modern bed frames. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows are a concern and would need child-proof locks; the tile flooring in the main areas is hard but easy to clean, while one bedroom has wood flooring. The kitchen is compact but functional with a glass backsplash. At 8F in a 13-story building, an elevator is very likely. Overall a clean, well-maintained unit but the description is minimal (agent listing placeholder only), which is a minor red flag — verify details directly."}
