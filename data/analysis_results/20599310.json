{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern and well-maintained apartment with stylish stone-look wall panels, crystal chandeliers, recessed LED lighting, glossy tile floors, and a sleek kitchen island with bar seating. The living area is clean and furnished with a leather sofa, white coffee table, large TV, and built-in ceiling AC. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp-edged glass coffee table are concerns, and there appear to be stairs visible through the glass doors at the back suggesting a loft/duplex layout which would be a significant hazard for a crawling baby; the balcony glass doors should also be checked for secure locks. Natural light appears limited based on the nighttime photos, but the space is bright with artificial lighting and the 4th floor in a 13-story building almost certainly has an elevator."}
