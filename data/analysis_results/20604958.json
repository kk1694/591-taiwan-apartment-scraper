{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern dark wood cabinetry and recessed lighting throughout. The unit has at least 3 bedrooms with good natural light from multiple windows and appears clean. For baby safety, the floors are smooth tile which is easy to clean but slippery; the furniture has some sharp corners on dressers and desks that would need padding; no visible balcony railings or stairs in photos. Being on the 1st floor eliminates stair/elevator concerns but may mean less privacy and natural light."}
