{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "This is a spacious 67 ping (221 sqm) apartment on the 4th floor of an 11-story building in Neihu district, priced at NT$83,000/month. The listing description only contains a promotional message for the agent's sales package and provides no details about the apartment's condition, fixtures, or layout. Without images or a substantive description, it is impossible to assess modernity, baby safety features, natural light, or elevator availability — the listing appears to be a placeholder or minimal agent posting, which is a red flag."}
