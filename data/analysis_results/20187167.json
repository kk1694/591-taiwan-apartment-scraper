{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment in Da'an with hardwood floors, open-plan kitchen with island bar, decorative brick accent wall, built-in wood cabinetry with mirror, glass-enclosed shower, and electronic bidet toilet. The bedroom has natural light through wrought-iron balcony railings which appear secure; the bar stools with swivel bases and glass coffee table with metal legs could be hazards for a crawling baby. Overall clean and in good condition at 25 ping on the 10th floor of a 14-story building, likely with elevator; the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only) which is a minor red flag regarding transparency."}
