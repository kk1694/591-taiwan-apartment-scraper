{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, clean, unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern split AC units, polished tile floors, and good natural light from large windows with city/mountain views. Being on 11F of a 27-story building strongly indicates elevator access. No visible balconies, stairs, or sharp corners pose minimal baby safety concerns, though exposed ceiling pipes and wall outlets would need childproofing."}
