{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with new fixtures, light wood cabinetry, induction cooktop, built-in oven, microwave, and AC. Floor is polished tile throughout with no stairs visible, making it baby-safe; no balcony shown in images. Natural light appears limited based on photos but the space is bright with recessed lighting. Building appears to be a newer high-rise marketed to expats (Elegant Realty watermark), and being on 10F of 15F strongly suggests elevator access."}
