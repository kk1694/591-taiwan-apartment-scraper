{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious and recently renovated apartment with modern wood-tone flooring, recessed lighting, split AC units, and a clean open-plan living/dining area. The flat layout with no visible stairs is excellent for baby safety, though the industrial-style bench seating has metal legs and sharp corners that would need padding. Natural light comes through windows/balcony doors at one end but appears moderate; the listing description is minimal (just a promotional ad), so details on layout and elevator are unclear. At 50 ping this is a generously sized unit in good condition with no major red flags."}
