The unit features a well-equipped open kitchen with washing machine, microwave, and ample storage. For baby safety, the glass coffee table and hard floor surfaces may need attention, but there are no visible stairs or concerning balcony railings. Natural light comes through large curtained windows, and the space appears very clean and well-maintained."}
