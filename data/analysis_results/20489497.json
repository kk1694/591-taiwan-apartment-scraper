{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment with clean finishes, wood-grain paneling, and built-in storage throughout. The living area has a glass coffee table with sharp edges that could be a concern for a crawling baby. The bedroom appears small but functional with good natural light. Windows appear secure with no visible balcony access, which is good for baby safety. Overall clean and well-maintained condition."}
