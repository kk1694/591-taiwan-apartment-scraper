{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious older-style apartment in a typical 7-story Taiwan walk-up building (no elevator visible, older tiled facade). The interior is clean but dated with 90s-era design elements including wood-framed ceiling panels, glass block windows, and white lattice partitions. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings but some rooms have exposed cables on the floor that would need securing; the polished tile and hardwood floors are slippery. Natural light appears limited due to small windows and heavy curtains."}
