{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is clearly a commercial/office space, not a residential apartment. The main area features fluorescent drop ceiling lights, a pool table, folding chairs, and commercial-grade shelving — resembling an old office or recreation room. A back room has open shelving units and a large wooden cabinet, also office-like. Being on 4F/4F of a walk-up with no elevator, carrying a stroller and baby supplies would be very difficult. This space is entirely unsuitable for a couple expecting a baby — it lacks any residential features (no kitchen, bathroom, bedroom visible), has poor natural light, and would require complete renovation to become livable."}
