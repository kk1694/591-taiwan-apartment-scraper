{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern and stylish apartment with high-end finishes including marble-look wall panels, crystal chandeliers, recessed lighting, and a sleek open-plan kitchen with white island counter. The space is immaculately clean with polished tile floors, modern white furniture, and glass sliding doors leading to a balcony. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp-cornered coffee table and kitchen island would need padding; the balcony glass doors should be checked for secure locks. The 13-floor building on the 4th floor almost certainly has an elevator, and the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag — request full details on layout and room count."}
