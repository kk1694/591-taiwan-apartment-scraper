{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and well-renovated apartment with contemporary fixtures, recessed lighting, and quality finishes. The space is clean and bright with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the balcony has sliding doors that can be locked, but the glass table and some furniture corners may need padding. Being on the 7th floor of a 7-floor building without confirmed elevator could be a concern for carrying a stroller and baby items."}
