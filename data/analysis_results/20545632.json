{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with brand new marble-look tile flooring, recessed LED lighting, fresh white walls, and wall-mounted AC units. The space is very clean and modern with multiple rooms visible, good natural light from large windows, and no visible safety hazards for a baby. However, it is completely empty with no kitchen or bathroom shown, on the 2nd floor of a 5-story walkup building which means carrying a stroller up stairs; the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag."}
