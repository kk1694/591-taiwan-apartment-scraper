{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "This is a top-floor unit (4F/4F) in a walk-up building with no elevator, which is a significant concern for a couple expecting a baby (carrying stroller/baby up 4 flights). At 37 ping (122 sqm) the size is generous for a family. The listing description is minimal (appears to be a broker advertisement template rather than a real description), which is a red flag - limited information makes it impossible to assess modernity, condition, natural light, or baby safety features like balcony railings and sharp corners. The price of NT$52,999/month for Da'an district at this size is reasonable but warrants an in-person visit to verify condition."}
