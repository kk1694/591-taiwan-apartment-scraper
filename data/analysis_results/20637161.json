{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with sleek black-and-white design, LED accent lighting, large TV wall unit, and glossy tile floors. The unit appears to be a large studio or 1-bedroom (29.53 ping per the ad) with open living area, separate bedroom area with diamond-pattern accent wall, compact kitchenette (induction cooktop, microwave, washing machine, small fridge), and good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, the slippery polished tile floors are a concern for a crawling baby, and the balcony area visible through the large windows would need childproofing; however the flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus. Being on 12F of a 15F building strongly suggests elevator access. Listed via Eastern Real Estate (東森房屋) agent 黃宏文."}
