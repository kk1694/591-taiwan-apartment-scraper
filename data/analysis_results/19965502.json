{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated open-plan apartment with high-end minimalist white finishes, recessed lighting, central AC, new kitchen with LG fridge, and light wood-tone flooring throughout. The space is clean and spacious at 23 ping with a dedicated study/closet area and good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the open layout with no stairs is good, but the folding metal chairs have pinch points, and the balcony door access should be checked for secure locking; overall an excellent, move-in-ready unit in Da'an district."}
