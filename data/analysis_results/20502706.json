{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Modern apartment with track lighting, grey wood-look flooring, wall-mounted AC, large flat-screen TV, and a modern kitchen with gas stove and built-in cabinetry. The unit is currently very cluttered with toys, figurines, and personal items which obscure the actual condition, but underlying finishes appear well-maintained. For baby safety, the living room has many small objects and electronics at floor level that would need clearing; windows appear to have proper frames but low windowsill storage areas could be a climbing hazard. Natural light is decent from large living room windows with a city view. The 5th floor of an 11-story building almost certainly has an elevator."}
