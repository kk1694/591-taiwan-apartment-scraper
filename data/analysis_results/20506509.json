{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean studio apartment managed by UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly agency) with a Murphy/wall bed, built-in wardrobe, small desk, and a compact but well-equipped kitchenette with fridge, microwave, washer-dryer, and sink. The space is very compact at ~12 ping — essentially a single open room — which would be very tight for a couple with a baby and leaves no room for a crib. Natural light appears limited to one window facing what looks like a light well; no balcony is visible, which removes that hazard but also limits ventilation and drying space."}
