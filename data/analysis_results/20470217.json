{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "High-end modern renovation with designer furniture, stylish lighting, sleek kitchen with gas stove and large fridge, en-suite master bedroom with good natural light. The wood-slab coffee tables have sharp/irregular edges that would need baby-proofing, and the open kitchen layout means a crawling baby could access the cooking area. Listed through UR HOUSE (foreign-friendly agency) which is a plus; the apartment is very clean and well-maintained at 38.5 ping with a spacious 2BR layout suitable for a growing family."}
