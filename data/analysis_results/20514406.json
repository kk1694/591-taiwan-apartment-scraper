{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with high ceilings, marble-style accent wall, recessed lighting, and quality wood finishes throughout. Good natural light from large windows with exterior security bars. For baby safety, note the hard tile floors, glass coffee table with sharp corners, and balcony/window areas with decorative iron railings that would need childproofing. The space appears clean and spacious at 25.7 ping with separate living, dining, and bedroom areas."}
