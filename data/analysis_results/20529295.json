{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Stylish loft-style apartment with industrial-modern design, featuring exposed concrete floors, designer furniture, track lighting, and a ceiling fan. The unit appears to be a duplex/mezzanine layout with internal stairs visible in image 4, which is a significant baby safety concern — the staircase has open metal railings that a toddler could slip through. Good natural light from large windows on multiple sides, and the space is clean and well-maintained with air conditioning. The open shelving units with sharp corners and the hard concrete flooring are additional concerns for a crawling baby; the agent (Your House) offers multilingual service in Chinese, English, and Japanese."}
