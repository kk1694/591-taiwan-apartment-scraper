{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very modern, stylishly furnished apartment in excellent condition with clean white walls, polished tile floors, modern L-shaped sofa, wall-mounted TV, split AC, designer pendant lights, and a sleek white kitchen with gas cooktop and glass backsplash. The 14-floor building almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the polished tile floors are very slippery and the glass coffee table has sharp corners; the exposed ceiling pipes/conduits in the dining area are an industrial design choice but not a hazard. Natural light appears moderate from the window/balcony area with sheer curtains. Listed via ULive Realty agent; description is minimal (just a promotional blurb), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout, bedrooms, and lease terms."}
