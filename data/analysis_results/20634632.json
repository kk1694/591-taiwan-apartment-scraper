{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated finishes including yellow-orange tile floors, old window AC unit, and worn bathroom with stained grout. The balcony has good railings but the enclosed kitchen/utility area appears cluttered with exposed pipes. For a baby, the hard tile floors throughout and lack of modern finishes are concerns; the bathroom shows wear and the overall condition is fair but not renovated."}
