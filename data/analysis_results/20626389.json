{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou, mountainside area", "notes": "Spacious and clean modern apartment on the 18th floor of a 21-story high-rise with mountain views. The living room has large windows with good natural light, recessed ceiling lighting, AC units, and polished tile floors. Bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms and built-in wardrobes. For baby safety, the large living room windows appear to have low sills which would need childproofing, and the bedroom windows have security bars which is a plus. The tile floors are very smooth and slippery which could be a concern for a crawling baby. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad), so details on kitchen, bathroom condition, and lease terms are unknown — an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
