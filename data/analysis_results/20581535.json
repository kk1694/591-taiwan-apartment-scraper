{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near Taipei 101", "notes": "Upscale modern apartment on 12F of a 19-story building with stunning Taipei 101 views. Interior features stylish finishes including wood flooring, recessed lighting, designer furniture, marble countertops, and a well-equipped open kitchen with washer and full-size fridge. The glass coffee table has sharp edges that would need baby-proofing, and the floor-to-ceiling windows near the balcony should be checked for secure locks; otherwise the flat layout with no stairs is very baby-friendly. Excellent natural light and clean condition overall — a premium Xinyi District unit with no major red flags."}
