{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment with good laminate flooring, built-in cabinetry, and recessed lighting. The unit appears to have a loft/mezzanine level with decorative ironwork railings which could be a climbing hazard for children. The mattress in the bedroom appears stained/worn. Good natural light from large windows but the loft stairs and open railings would need baby-proofing."}
