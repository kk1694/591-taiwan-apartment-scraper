{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern unfurnished apartment with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, crown molding, and large black-framed windows providing good natural light across multiple rooms. The 20-story building on 3F almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery when wet and the hard surfaces pose bump risks; however, there are no visible stairs, balconies, or sharp corners, and the windows appear to have secure frames — overall a safe, spacious layout suitable for a family with a baby."}
