{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This space has strong commercial/office characteristics: drop ceiling with fluorescent panel lighting, large built-in shelving units typical of offices, wide panoramic windows with low cabinets below, and an overall open-plan layout resembling an office suite rather than a residential apartment. The wood-panel walls and floors are dated. Natural light is decent from the large windows but the fluorescent ceiling lights give it a commercial feel. For a couple with a baby this is not ideal as it would require significant conversion from office to residential use, and the listing description is minimal (just an agent advertisement), which is a red flag."}
