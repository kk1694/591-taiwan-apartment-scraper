{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated duplex-style apartment with stylish grey wood finishes, LED accent lighting, modern kitchen, and built-in wardrobes. Major baby safety concern: internal stairs without railings leading to upper sleeping loft area, which would require gates and supervision. Balcony visible with standard railings. Clean and bright with natural light from large windows, though limited window views suggest neighboring buildings are close."}
