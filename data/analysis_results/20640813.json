{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei 101, Da'an District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated finishes but clean condition. Layout is 3 bedrooms, 2 living rooms, 2 bathrooms. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) with no elevator info is a concern. Balcony doors visible in bedrooms may need baby gates; exposed wires visible on living room floor are a hazard. Good natural light and excellent city view including Taipei 101."}
