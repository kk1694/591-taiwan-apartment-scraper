{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with modern white tile flooring, recessed lighting, modern kitchen with glass backsplash and SAMPO fridge, and a digital door lock. The glass coffee table with metal legs in the living room has sharp corners that would be a baby safety concern. At 35 ping on 2F of a 13-story building, this is a spacious unit likely with elevator access; natural light comes through floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room and bedroom, though the 2F position may limit direct sunlight. Overall good condition and cleanliness with no major red flags."}
