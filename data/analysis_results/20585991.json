{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean 1-bedroom apartment in a high-rise building with white minimalist decor, recessed lighting, split AC, washing machine, microwave, and built-in storage. The glass coffee table has sharp edges which is a concern for a crawling baby, and the balcony (image 5) has horizontal railing bars that a toddler could climb — this is a significant safety risk on the 9th floor. The unit gets decent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows but faces a neighboring building closely, and at 23 ping it may feel tight for a couple with a baby given the open-plan kitchen/living area layout."}
