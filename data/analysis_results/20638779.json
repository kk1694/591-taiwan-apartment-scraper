{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, AC, and contemporary furnishings including leather sofa and large TV. The open layout is spacious but has some baby safety considerations - the hard tile floors would need rugs, and furniture corners appear relatively sharp. Natural light is limited due to small high windows, but the space is clean and in excellent condition overall."}
