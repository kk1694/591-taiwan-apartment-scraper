{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Grand Hotel Taipei (Yuanshan area)", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, light wood cabinetry, and polished tile floors. Excellent natural light from multiple large windows with mountain views. The glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a baby safety concern; the open kitchen layout means easy access to stove/sink for a crawling child. No visible balcony railings to worry about. The 7th floor in an 11-story building strongly suggests an elevator exists."}
