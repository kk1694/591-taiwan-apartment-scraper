{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District, near a park with pond/greenery", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with wood-panel accent walls, recessed lighting, tile and wood-laminate flooring, and built-in wardrobes. At least 2 bedrooms each with en-suite bathrooms, plus a living room with balcony access via sliding glass doors. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and the balcony sliding doors are baby safety concerns; the raised step between bedroom and bathroom in image 4 is also a trip hazard. Good natural light from large windows and balcony; nearby park with walking paths is a plus for families. Being on 2F of a 7-floor building, no elevator info is available but the low floor mitigates this. Clean and move-in ready condition overall."}
