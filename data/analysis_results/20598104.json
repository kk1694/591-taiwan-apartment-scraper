{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious and modern apartment with high-end finishes including marble accents, recessed lighting, and polished floors. The open floor plan with large living area and enclosed balcony provides good natural light. For baby safety, the hard tile floors are slippery, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, and the balcony sliding doors should be monitored, but the overall layout is flat with no visible stairs or dangerous railings."}
