{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious 36-ping apartment with polished tile flooring in the living area and wood-look flooring in bedrooms; clean but dated with older window-unit AC, traditional light fixtures, and aging cabinetry. The bedroom has a small balcony with narrow metal railings that would need baby-proofing, and the slippery polished tile floor in the living room is a fall risk for a crawling toddler. Good natural light from large windows, multiple rooms suitable for a nursery, but the 5th floor without a confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller."}
