{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with high-end finishes including marble wall accents, recessed LED lighting, dark stone tile flooring in the living area, and light wood laminate in bedrooms. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at 46 ping with multiple rooms visible. For baby safety, the dark stone floors in the entry/living area are hard and slippery — rugs and padding would be essential; the large mirror/glass wall panels and sharp-edged marble corners also pose risks. Good natural light from large windows with blinds, and the unit appears very clean with a video intercom system visible."}
