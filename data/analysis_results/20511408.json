{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-renovated apartment with modern finishes including polished tile floors, crystal chandelier, built-in TV shelving, and split AC units. One bedroom already has children's furniture (IKEA Mammut stools) and a platform bed, suggesting family-friendliness. Windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, and the large open living/dining area has no obvious sharp corners or hazards. Good natural light in the bedroom through large windows; the living area appears to rely more on artificial lighting. At 35 ping on the 3rd floor of a 7-story building without confirmed elevator, carrying a stroller up stairs could be a concern. Overall clean, bright, and spacious — a strong option for a family with a baby."}
