{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in very clean condition with modern light wood finishes, polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and track lighting. The spacious living room has large windows with roller blinds providing decent natural light, a separate dining area, a study/office room, and a separate kitchen. For baby safety, the windows have security grilles which is positive, but the polished tile floors could be slippery; the 2F walk-up with no elevator would be manageable but inconvenient with a stroller. At 27 ping in Da'an district for NT$46K this is reasonably priced; the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and lease terms."}
