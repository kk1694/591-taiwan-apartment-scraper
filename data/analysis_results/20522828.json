{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment in excellent condition with contemporary furniture, recessed lighting, and split AC units. The flat layout with no visible stairs is baby-friendly, though the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need covers. Good natural light through large windows, and the space appears clean and well-maintained. At 16 floors, the building almost certainly has an elevator."}
