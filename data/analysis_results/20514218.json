{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern, newly built high-rise apartment on 13F with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows in multiple rooms. The unit is in pristine, move-in ready condition with contemporary furnishings, modern kitchen, split AC, and stylish light fixtures. For baby safety, the large sliding glass doors/balcony access in the living room and bedrooms will need child locks, and the glass coffee table with sharp edges is a concern; however, the flat single-level layout with no stairs and smooth tile floors are positives. Listed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), which is a good sign for English-speaking tenants."}
