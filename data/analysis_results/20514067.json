{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Modern duplex-style apartment with high ceilings, recessed lighting, stone accent wall, and stylish furnishings in excellent condition. Major baby safety concern: the unit has an internal staircase leading to a loft/mezzanine level with open railings that would require baby gates and childproofing. The balcony has vertical railings at a reasonable height but should be checked for gap spacing. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows, very clean and well-maintained. The 27-floor building in Xinyi almost certainly has an elevator."}
