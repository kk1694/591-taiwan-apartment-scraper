{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with high-end finishes including sleek wood accents, recessed lighting, modern kitchen with gas stove and dishwasher. The space is exceptionally clean with bright white tiles and good natural light from multiple windows with zebra blinds. For baby safety, the open floor plan is good but furniture corners (dining table) could need padding; no visible balcony access in photos but stairs visible in kitchen area suggest possible duplex layout which could require gates."}
