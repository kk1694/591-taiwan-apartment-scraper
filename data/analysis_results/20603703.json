{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "This is a high-end luxury residential complex with an impressive grand lobby, landscaped courtyard with a reflecting pool and Japanese-inspired pavilion. The 13-floor building clearly has elevators and a staffed entrance. However, all 5 images show only the building exterior and common areas — no interior photos of the actual apartment unit are provided, making it impossible to assess the unit's condition, layout, natural light, or baby safety concerns like balcony railings and sharp corners. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent advertisement), which is a red flag — at 53 ping and NT$74,500/month this is a large, premium unit but the lack of interior photos and meaningful description suggests caution; an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
