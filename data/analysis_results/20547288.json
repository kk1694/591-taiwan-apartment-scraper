{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern fixtures, recessed lighting, AC, and contemporary furniture. The space is very clean with smooth tile floors and no visible stairs or sharp corners, making it relatively baby-safe; windows have security grilles. Natural light appears limited based on the small window shown, but the interior lighting is good. Being on floor 7 of 15 in a newer building strongly suggests elevator access."}
