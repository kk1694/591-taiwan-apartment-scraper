{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious, modern unfurnished apartment with clean white walls, modern track lighting, and new tile flooring. The open floor plan with large windows provides good natural light. For baby safety, the space has visible balcony with railing that would need to be checked for height/spacing, and all floors are flat with no stairs. The unit appears freshly renovated and very clean, though completely empty so you would need to furnish it entirely."}
