{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with recessed lighting, designer furniture, and high-end finishes. The open floor plan is spacious with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the coffee table has some sharp corners and the bar stools are unstable for climbing toddlers, but overall the flat layout with no visible stairs is positive. Being on the 15th floor of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
