{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new, high-end unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with hardwood floors, modern built-in wardrobes, Rinnai range hood with gas cooktop, sleek black glass backsplash, and a built-in refrigerator with freezer. The space is very clean with recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the flat open layout with no stairs is ideal; low power outlets have safety switches, and the lack of furniture means parents can child-proof from scratch — however the open kitchen with gas stove will need a gate barrier once baby is mobile."}
