{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Modern, well-maintained duplex-style apartment with recessed lighting, glossy tile floors, built-in kitchen with microwave and ample cabinetry, and a separate bedroom with air conditioning and air purifier. Major baby safety concern: image 4 shows steep internal floating stairs with no railing or gate, which is extremely dangerous for a crawling baby or toddler. The apartment appears clean with decent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows, and the 9-floor building on the 5th floor likely has an elevator. The description is a generic agent advertisement with no useful property details, which is a minor red flag."}
