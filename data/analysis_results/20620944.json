{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including stylish ring pendant lights, new laminate flooring, wall-mounted AC and TV. The space is clean and minimalist with good natural light from security-grilled windows. For baby safety, the single-level layout is good but exposed cables near TV need securing; the frosted glass sliding door has minimal sharp edges. No elevator visible in images for this 2nd floor unit in a 4-story building."}
