{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, modern AC units, and large windows providing abundant natural light overlooking a well-maintained park/garden. Balcony has proper vertical metal railings with narrow spacing that appear baby-safe. The building appears to be part of a newer residential complex (10-story building with elevator expected). No visible stairs within unit, but note the slippery polished floors may need rugs for a crawling baby."}
