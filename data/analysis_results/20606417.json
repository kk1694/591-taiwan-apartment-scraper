{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious, high-end apartment on 15F with modern finishes including hardwood floors, recessed lighting, a well-equipped kitchen with LG refrigerator and glass cabinetry, and an upscale bathroom with glass-enclosed shower and marble finishes. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), the unit has excellent natural light from large windows and is very clean with no visible clutter. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is ideal, the large windows appear to have secure frames, and corners are mostly rounded; however the glass coffee table and open bathroom glass shelving would need baby-proofing."}
