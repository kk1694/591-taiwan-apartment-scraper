{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious unfurnished apartment (66 ping) with dated 1990s-era decor including decorative columns, ornate ceiling moldings, faux stone accent wall, and older wood flooring — clean but not modern. Being on 3F/3F of a low-rise walkup strongly suggests no elevator, which is a concern for carrying a stroller and baby gear. The open layout with low half-walls, sharp-cornered built-in cabinets, and tiled kitchen step-down area are baby safety concerns; however the large flat floor area with hardwood is good for a crawling baby, and natural light appears moderate from several windows."}
