{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and clean living room with polished tile floors, modern furniture including an L-shaped sofa and glass coffee table, decorative pendant light, and wallpapered accent walls. The balcony has sturdy vertical metal railings which are good for baby safety, and sliding glass doors separate it from the living area. The glass coffee table with sharp metal edges is a baby safety concern and would need corner guards. Only the living room is shown in 4 photos — no bedrooms, kitchen, or bathroom visible, which is a red flag. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), so layout details and actual condition of other rooms remain unknown."}
