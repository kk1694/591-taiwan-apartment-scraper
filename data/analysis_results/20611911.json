{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment marketed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) with recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, modern kitchen with gas stove and ample counter space, and at least two bedrooms. The living room has large sliding glass doors to a balcony with decent natural light, and the overall condition is clean and move-in ready. For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors and low TV stand corners would need childproofing, but the flat single-floor layout on 2F of an 8-story building (likely with elevator given the modern build) is convenient; the smooth tile floors in common areas are easy to clean but slippery for a crawling baby."}
