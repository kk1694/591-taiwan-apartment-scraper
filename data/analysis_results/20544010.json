{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older building with dated dark wood paneling and trim throughout, though the bathroom has been recently renovated with modern marble-style tiles and glass shower partition. The apartment is unfurnished with hardwood floors and large curved bay windows providing good natural light. Major red flag: there is an active large-scale construction site directly outside the window which will cause significant noise and dust — very concerning for a baby. The 5th floor with no confirmed elevator could be difficult with a stroller and baby gear. The large windows appear to have adequate railings/grills for baby safety, and the spacious open layout is a plus for a growing family."}
