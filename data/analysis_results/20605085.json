{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment (59 ping) with dated 1990s-era decor including wood paneling, crystal chandeliers, and dark hardwood floors. The unit is clean but the finishes and styling are clearly older. The balcony has a low stone railing that would be a significant baby safety concern and would need childproofing; the glass cabinet corners in the bedrooms also pose risks. Good natural light from multiple windows in each room, and the spacious layout with at least 3 bedrooms provides plenty of room for a growing family. Washer/dryer on the rear balcony. No kitchen or bathroom photos provided, which is a red flag."}
