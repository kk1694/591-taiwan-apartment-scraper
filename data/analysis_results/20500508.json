{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with contemporary furniture, recessed lighting, and a clean minimalist aesthetic. The kitchen features modern appliances including induction cooktop, microwave, and rice cooker. For baby safety, the balcony with sliding glass doors has adequate railings but access should be monitored; the open shelving and sharp-cornered coffee table may need childproofing. Good natural light through floor-to-ceiling windows, and the space appears very clean and well-maintained."}
