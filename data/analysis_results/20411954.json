{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated 1990s-style wood cabinetry, textured ceilings, and tile flooring throughout. The space is clean and reasonably well-maintained but shows its age. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard surfaces, and the kitchen has open access to stove and low cabinets; no visible balcony railings or stairs to assess, but corner protectors would be recommended on the wooden furniture edges."}
