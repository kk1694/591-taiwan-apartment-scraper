{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with terrazzo floors, recessed lighting, and a large living/dining area. The unit is clean and in decent condition but has dated finishes including an older wall-mounted AC unit and traditional Taiwanese cabinetry with glass shelves. The balcony has metal railings that appear adequate but would need a baby gate at the sliding door; the glass shelves on the display cabinet pose a tipping/breakage hazard for a crawling child. Good natural light from large balcony windows on the 7th floor, and at 71.85 ping this is very spacious for a family."}
