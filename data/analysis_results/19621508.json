{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious European-style apartment in excellent condition with marble accent walls, crystal chandelier, light wood flooring, modern open kitchen, and a large walk-in closet. Major baby safety concern: the unit has a loft/mezzanine area with internal stairs and glass railings that would need childproofing, and the glass partition walls between rooms could be hazardous. Good natural light from large windows; the 13-story building on floor 7 almost certainly has an elevator. Very clean and well-maintained, though the ornate furniture and glass elements require extra baby-proofing effort."}
