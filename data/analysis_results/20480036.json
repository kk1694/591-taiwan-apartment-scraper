{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with clean white walls, light wood laminate flooring, and contemporary furnishings. Features wall-mounted AC, modern pendant lighting, and a TV still wrapped in plastic suggesting new condition. For baby safety: the space appears open-plan with minimal visible hazards, though glass/balcony areas visible in background would need assessment. Good natural light from window/balcony area at rear. Overall very clean and well-maintained unit."}
