{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment with stylish designer lighting, L-shaped sectional sofa, 6-seat dining set, and polished tile floors throughout. The space appears clean and well-maintained with contemporary decor including art prints and open shelving. At 54 ping on the 2nd floor of a 14-story building (likely has elevator), this is spacious for a family; however, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the hard tile floors could be a concern for a crawling baby — area rugs would be advisable. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout, number of bedrooms, kitchen, and bathroom conditions."}
