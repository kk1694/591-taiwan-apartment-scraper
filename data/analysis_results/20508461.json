{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained modern apartment at 64 ping with hardwood floors, recessed and ambient ceiling lighting, built-in AC, quality leather furniture, and a solid wood dining set. The large living room has floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light, and the hallway suggests multiple bedrooms. The balcony has metal railings with vertical slat screening that appear reasonably child-safe, though the glass coffee table with sharp edges and the hanging egg chair on the balcony would need baby-proofing attention. Overall a clean, upscale unit in a newer building (8F/10F strongly suggests elevator) that would be very suitable for a family with a baby."}
