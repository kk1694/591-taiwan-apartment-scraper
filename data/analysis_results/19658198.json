{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with stylish herringbone wood flooring, modern LED ceiling lights, wall-mounted AC units, and decorative mosaic tile accent walls. The unit is unfurnished, spacious at 28 ping, and very clean with large sliding glass doors leading to a balcony. For baby safety, the balcony access via full-height sliding glass doors needs childproofing, and the low built-in wooden cabinets have accessible drawers; however, the open floor plan with no stairs and smooth flooring is generally baby-friendly. Natural light appears moderate with windows on multiple sides, though some views face neighboring buildings closely."}
