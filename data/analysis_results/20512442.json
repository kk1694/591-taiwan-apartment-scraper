{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment with older-style finishes — decorative wood beam ceiling, window-unit AC, and parquet hardwood floors in bedrooms suggest a 1990s-era building. The unit is clean and well-maintained with good natural light from balcony doors with security grilles. For baby safety, the balcony railings appear to have bars but the open grid-style room dividers with many small square openings could be a climbing hazard for a toddler; the tile and hardwood floors are slippery, and the unit being on 2F without confirmed elevator access in a 7-story older building is a concern for stroller use."}
