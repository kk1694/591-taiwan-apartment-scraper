{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale modern duplex on 12F with high-end finishes including stone accent walls, built-in entertainment center, and crystal chandeliers. Major baby safety concern: internal staircase visible with no gate, and glass coffee table with sharp corners. The unit appears very clean with good natural light, but being on the top floor (12/12) may mean more heat exposure and potential roof leak issues."}
