{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with stylish track lighting, open-plan living/dining area, updated kitchen with breakfast bar, and spacious bedroom with hardwood floors and AC. The glass dining table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the kitchen bar stools could be a tipping hazard for a toddler. At 38 ping on 5F/12F in Da'an, this is a spacious and desirable unit; the building almost certainly has an elevator given the 12-story height, though the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and total rooms."}
