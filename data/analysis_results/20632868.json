{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex-style apartment in very clean, newly renovated condition with glossy tile floors, recessed lighting, black-frame sliding glass doors, wall-mounted TV, AC, washing machine, and a small kitchen area. Major baby safety concern: the unit has internal stairs connecting two levels with no visible baby gate, and the stair railing appears low and open — this would need baby-proofing. Multiple balconies with glass railings also need attention. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows on multiple sides with green views."}
