{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, recently renovated apartment with clean finishes, polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and updated bathroom with glass shower enclosure. The unit appears unfurnished with multiple rooms having good natural light through large windows. Baby safety is generally good - no visible stairs, sharp corners minimal, but windows lack visible child safety locks and the slippery polished floors may need rugs. Floor 10 of 12 strongly suggests elevator access."}
