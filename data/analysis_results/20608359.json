{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Mixed condition apartment: living room has recessed lighting and wood-laminate flooring but bedrooms show worn walls with marks/stains and dated furniture. Bathroom is reasonably clean with glass shower partition. The rear balcony/laundry area is cluttered and dirty with stacked washer-dryer units; balcony railings appear low and the area has gaps that would be a serious safety concern for a crawling baby. Being 1F of a 5-story older walkup building, likely no elevator; natural light appears limited in interior rooms."}
