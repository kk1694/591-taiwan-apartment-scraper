{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with stylish finishes including recessed lighting, wood-tone flooring, a modern white kitchen with gas stove and ample counter space, and a comfortable leather sofa in the living room. Listed through UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋), an agency catering to expats. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with metal frame has sharp edges that would need padding, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows/balcony door in the bedroom should be checked for secure locks; the overall layout is single-level and relatively open which is good. Good natural light from large windows in both living room and bedroom, and the space is clean and well-maintained at 27.72 ping — spacious enough for a family."}
