{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall MRT Station, Da'an/Xinyi border, with Taipei 101 visible nearby", "notes": "Older building (likely 1980s-90s) with dated interior decor including ornate traditional-style doors, dark hardwood floors, and classical European-style lobby with pillars and decorative moldings. The unit appears unfurnished with boxes stacked inside, suggesting it may be undergoing renovation or move-in preparation. For baby safety, the 3rd floor walkup (elevator status unclear) could be challenging with a stroller; the building exterior shows open balconies with low railings that would need child-proofing. Natural light appears moderate from the windows shown. The location is excellent — very close to Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall MRT and within view of Taipei 101 — but the building itself is aging and the interior would need significant updating to feel comfortable for a young family."}
