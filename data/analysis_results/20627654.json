{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment at 56 ping with recessed lighting, wood-grain flooring throughout, built-in wardrobes, and a stylish open-plan living/dining area with kitchen bar counter. At 15F/15F, the building almost certainly has an elevator. At least 3 bedrooms visible (master with large built-in closets, a child/single room, and another double room), making it very suitable for a family. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is ideal; corners on the coffee table and dining furniture are relatively rounded, though the bar counter area with high stools could be a concern. Natural light appears decent through shuttered windows but no balcony is visible in photos, which reduces fall risk. The description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), so verify details directly with agent Ms. Huang at 0918055898."}
