{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern loft-style studio with high ceilings, contemporary furnishings, track lighting, and a well-equipped kitchenette. Baby safety concerns include an open metal ladder to the loft area which poses a significant fall hazard, and the balcony with glass railings needs child locks. The space is clean with good natural light, but the compact layout and loft design may be challenging with an infant."}
