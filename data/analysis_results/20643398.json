{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, clean apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, polished tile floors, and split AC units. The unit is unfurnished except for one bedroom with bed, desk, and wardrobe. Good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety: hard tile floors throughout, no visible balcony hazards, but sharp corner moldings at ceiling level and exposed electrical panels in hallway may need childproofing. Overall in excellent condition with no visible red flags."}
