{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "This appears to be a ground-floor unit in an older red brick building with a covered outdoor courtyard area. The exterior shows aged brick walls, window-unit AC, metal security bars on doors and windows, and basic tile flooring. The description is minimal (just a generic agent promotion), providing no useful details about the interior. For a couple with a baby, concerns include the lack of interior photos making it impossible to assess indoor condition, the metal gate/bars suggest an older walkup, and at 40 ping on 1F it could potentially be a commercial or mixed-use space rather than a pure residential flat. Red flag: very sparse listing with only exterior photos and no real description."}
