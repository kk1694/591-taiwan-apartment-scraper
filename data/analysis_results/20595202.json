{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "High-end modern apartment on 11F with premium hardwood flooring, designer lighting, floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light, and a sleek white kitchen with built-in appliances including washer and oven. The space is very clean and well-maintained with a warm wood-toned interior design. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows and balcony access with sliding doors are a concern and would need child locks or gates; the glass dining table has sharp corners that should be padded. The open layout and smooth flooring are otherwise baby-friendly, and the high floor in a modern Xinyi high-rise almost certainly has an elevator."}
