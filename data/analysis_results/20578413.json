{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment in clean condition with a mix of tiled living areas and hardwood-floor bedrooms. The decorative wooden ceiling beams and lattice room dividers give it an older Taiwanese aesthetic (1990s-2000s era), not modern. Window-mounted AC units and iron window grilles are typical of older buildings. For baby safety, the polished tile floors could be slippery, and the small step-up between rooms is a tripping hazard; the iron balcony grilles appear secure. Natural light appears decent from multiple windows, and the unit is very clean and move-in ready, but completely unfurnished. Listed through Miller House agency."}
