{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "This is a 34 ping unit on the 7th floor of a 26-story building, which strongly suggests elevator access. At NT$90,000/month it is priced at a premium level for Datong District. The listing description only contains a generic agent advertisement with no actual property details, making it impossible to assess condition, fixtures, baby safety features, or natural light. The lack of meaningful description is a red flag — prospective tenants should request photos and a viewing before considering this unit."}
