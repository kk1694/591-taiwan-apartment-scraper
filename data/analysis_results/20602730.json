{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District, possibly near 凱旋門 (Arc de Triomphe) community", "notes": "Older but well-maintained apartment in an upscale gated community with security. Spacious 46 ping unit on 8F with hardwood floors throughout, at least 3 bedrooms, and decent natural light. The building exterior sign partially shows 旋門 suggesting this is the 凱旋門 luxury complex. For baby safety, the living room has a glass coffee table with sharp corners that should be padded, the balcony off the living room needs child-proofing, and wall-mounted TVs with exposed cables in the second bedroom could be hazardous. Furnishings and fixtures are dated (older-style wooden cabinetry, CRT-era TV in master bedroom) but the space is clean and generously sized, making it a solid family option in a prime Da'an location."}
