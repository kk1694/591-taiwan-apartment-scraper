{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "The building appears well-maintained and modern with a granite-clad entrance, a nicely furnished lobby with modern lighting, and a marble-finished elevator hallway. The elevator is confirmed (image 4). However, all four images only show common areas (entrance, lobby, trash/utility area, elevator hall) — no interior apartment photos are provided, so the actual unit condition, layout, natural light, and baby safety concerns (balcony railings, sharp corners, stairs) cannot be assessed. The description is essentially just an agent advertisement with no real listing details, which is a red flag — this may be a placeholder or bait listing rather than a genuine rental at NT$70,000."}
