{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, bright apartment with modern finishes including light wood flooring, recessed lighting, and clean white walls. The open living/dining area has excellent natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors (verify railing height), and furniture has some sharp corners that may need padding. Overall very clean and well-maintained with a modern bathroom featuring a bathtub."}
