{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with clean white/neutral tones, recessed and track lighting, white brick accent wall, and quality furnishings including a large L-shaped sofa, dining table, and fully equipped kitchen with fridge, microwave, and gas stove. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and the glass-top side tables in the bedroom are baby safety concerns; the 6F/6F top-floor location with no confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller. Good natural light visible through large bedroom window with curtains, and the open layout with smooth tile and wood-look flooring is clean and spacious at 27 ping."}
