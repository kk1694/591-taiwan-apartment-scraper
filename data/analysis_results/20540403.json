{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment with stylish designer lighting, L-shaped sectional sofa, 6-seat dining set, and polished tile floors. The unit appears newly renovated with clean white walls, split AC, and contemporary furniture. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the polished tile floors could be slippery; however, the open floor plan is spacious at 49 ping and the 2nd floor of a 14-story building likely has elevator access. Natural light comes through large curtained windows in the living area."}
