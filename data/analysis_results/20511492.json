{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern white cabinetry, recessed lighting, open-plan kitchen/dining/living area, stainless steel appliances, split AC, and light wood flooring throughout. The space is very clean and well-maintained with good natural light from large windows; the bedroom on the 9th floor has a nice city view. For baby safety, the open kitchen layout means the gas stove area would need gating, and the low window sills in the bedroom with built-in storage below could be a climbing hazard, but overall the flat layout with no stairs and rounded furniture edges makes it reasonably baby-friendly."}
