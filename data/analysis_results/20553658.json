{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with white minimalist decor, large sectional sofa, contemporary kitchen with full appliances, and bright LED lighting throughout. Building appears to be a modern high-rise (6F/18F) with elevator based on the lobby entrance photo showing an intercom system. Good for a baby as the space is open with no visible stairs, though the low coffee table corners could need padding; large windows provide excellent natural light."}
