{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin hillside, likely Yangmingshan area", "notes": "Luxury high-floor apartment with stunning panoramic sunset and city views, marble-like polished floors, elegant chandeliers, recessed lighting, and floor-to-ceiling windows. The large wrap-around wooden deck terrace has glass-and-metal railings which are a significant baby safety concern — the horizontal bars and glass panels could be climbable, and the high elevation makes this extremely dangerous for a toddler. The unit is unfurnished and very spacious at 60 ping, in excellent clean condition with abundant natural light; however, the remote hillside location in Shilin may be inconvenient for daily errands and access to baby-related services."}
