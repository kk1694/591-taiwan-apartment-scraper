{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious, modern unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, crystal ceiling fixtures, split-type AC units in multiple rooms, polished tile floors, and a clean bathroom with bathtub. The balcony has ornamental iron railings visible from the living room which would need baby-proofing; the tile floors are very smooth and slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby. The unit is on the 10th floor of a 13-story building (very likely to have an elevator), with large windows providing good natural light, and the completely empty/unfurnished state means you will need to furnish it entirely but also means no existing hazards from old furniture or sharp corners."}
