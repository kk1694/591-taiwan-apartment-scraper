The unit features LED accent lighting, built-in cabinetry, modern kitchen with appliances, and a sleek bathroom. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, and the balcony area should be assessed for railing height. The space is very clean but compact as a studio layout with bed in the main living area."}
