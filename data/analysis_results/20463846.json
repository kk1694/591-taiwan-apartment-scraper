{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated studio apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, stylish wood-grain accent wall, glass bathroom partition, and stainless steel appliances. The open layout with no stairs and smooth tile floors is good for baby safety, though the compact size (~12.5 ping) may feel cramped for a growing family. Windows have security grilles which could limit natural light; no balcony visible which is actually safer with a baby."}
