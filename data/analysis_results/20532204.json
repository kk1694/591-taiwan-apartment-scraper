{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious 71.8 ping apartment in decent but dated condition with terrazzo flooring, recessed lighting, and older-style AC units. The unit is clean and well-maintained with a large master bedroom (wood laminate flooring), separate dining area seating 8, and a clean galley kitchen with DC inverter fridge and gas stove. For baby safety, the living room has a sliding glass door to a balcony with metal railings that appear adequate but should be checked in person; the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. The listing description is minimal (just an agent promotion), which is a minor red flag — further details on layout, number of rooms, and lease terms should be confirmed directly."}
