{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with warm wood flooring, recessed lighting, glass partition walls, and quality furnishings including sofa, dining set, and built-in shelving. The kitchen is fully equipped with modern dark-wood cabinetry, gas stove, range hood, refrigerator, and ample counter space. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), suggesting expat-friendly. For baby safety, the hardwood floors are good, no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access, but the glass partition between living room and study area would need child-proofing. Good natural light from large curtained windows; overall very clean and move-in ready at 23 ping which is a decent size for a young family. The 4th floor of a 9-story building very likely has an elevator."}
