{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment with sleek minimalist design, track lighting, modern kitchen with built-in appliances, and contemporary furniture. The space appears clean with good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is ideal, though the low TV stand and minimal furniture leave few hazards; however, the open kitchen area would need baby gates once the child is mobile."}
