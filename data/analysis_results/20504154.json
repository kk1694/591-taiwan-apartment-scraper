{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious, modern high-rise apartment (15F/21F) in excellent clean condition with polished tile floors, large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors opening to a balcony with wooden decking, and ample natural light from multiple windows. The balcony has railings but the sliding doors should be kept locked for baby safety; the unit is unfurnished with no sharp corners, which is good for childproofing. Kitchen is well-equipped with stainless steel counters and range hood, bathroom is clean with glass shower partition, and the overall condition is move-in ready with no visible red flags — a very suitable family apartment in a premium Da'an location."}
