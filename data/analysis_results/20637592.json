{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with clean wood-tone finishes, marble countertops, open kitchen with island, split AC, and modern lighting fixtures. The glass-top coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony sliding doors visible in images should be checked for child-safe locks. Good natural light from large windows/balcony; spacious open-plan living area is clean and well-maintained. Note: the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), so no details on lease terms or building amenities; elevator status unknown for this 4F/7F older-style building."}
