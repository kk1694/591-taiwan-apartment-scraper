{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 32-ping apartment with a living room that has commercial-style drop ceiling with fluorescent panel lighting, giving it an office-like feel rather than a cozy home; bedrooms have pink-painted walls with warmer lighting and are more residential in character. The glass coffee table and hard tile floors throughout are baby safety concerns, and being on the top floor (7F/7F) raises potential issues with heat and roof leaks. Natural light appears limited in the living area with small windows, though bedrooms have windows with some daylight; the space is clean but dated and the overall aesthetic is somewhat sterile."}
