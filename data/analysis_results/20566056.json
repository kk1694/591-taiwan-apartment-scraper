{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style studio with sleek finishes, marble flooring, and good natural light through large windows. Major baby safety concern: the mezzanine bedroom has an open metal railing and steep alternating-tread stairs without proper guardrails—very dangerous for a crawling baby or toddler. The compact space is clean and well-designed but the loft layout is not suitable for families with young children."}
