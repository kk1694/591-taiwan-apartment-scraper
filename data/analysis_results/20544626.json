{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white walls, contemporary furniture, and stylish lighting fixtures. On the 14th floor of a 19-story building, which virtually guarantees elevator access. The unit appears safe for a baby with no visible stairs, though the glass coffee table has sharp corners and the balcony door should be monitored; the space has good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows and is very clean with ample storage in the bedroom."}
