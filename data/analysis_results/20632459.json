{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern industrial-loft style renovation with exposed concrete ceilings, track lighting, glass partition walls, and large tile flooring. The space has a distinctive commercial/office aesthetic with metal mesh dividers, a TV mount, and minimal furnishing — it could function as either a residential loft or a creative studio/office space. For baby safety, the hard concrete and tile surfaces, exposed ceiling beams, sharp metal edges on partitions, and glass walls are concerns; being on 5F/5F with no visible elevator means carrying a stroller up 5 flights of stairs daily, which is a major practical drawback. The kitchen is clean and updated with a gas stove and glass backsplash, but the overall unfurnished industrial feel may require significant softening for a family with a baby."}
