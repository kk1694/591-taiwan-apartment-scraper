{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern recessed LED lighting, new wood-grain laminate flooring, stylish wallpaper accent wall, and split AC units. The space is very clean and well-maintained with multiple rooms visible. For baby safety, the windows have security bars which is good, but the glass bathroom door and some sharp-cornered furniture (vanity desk, coffee table) would need childproofing. Natural light appears limited from the photos, with small windows and bars suggesting a somewhat enclosed older building structure despite the modern interior renovation. At 3F with no elevator info, carrying a stroller up stairs could be a concern. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and amenities."}
