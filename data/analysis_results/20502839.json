{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Very spacious unfurnished apartment (78.57 ping) with dated 1990s-era decor including ornate ceiling medallions, old-style window AC units, and classical-style front door. The polished marble floors in the living area are extremely slippery which is a significant baby safety concern; the large balcony with decorative stone railings on the 6th floor also warrants child-proofing. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access; bedrooms have wood-look laminate flooring and are clean but bare. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag suggesting minimal landlord engagement."}
