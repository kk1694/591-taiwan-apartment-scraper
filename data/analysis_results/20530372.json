{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated unfurnished apartment with polished marble-like tile floors, recessed LED lighting, wall-mounted AC units in multiple rooms, and large sliding glass doors leading to a balcony. The unit is spacious at 57 ping with excellent natural light from large windows overlooking high-rise buildings. For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors and large windows will need child locks, and the highly polished tile floors may be slippery — area rugs recommended. The unit is very clean and in excellent move-in condition, though completely unfurnished. Building is 11 floors so almost certainly has an elevator."}
