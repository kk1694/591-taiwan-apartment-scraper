{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious upscale apartment with polished hardwood floors, recessed LED lighting, decorative stone accent walls, and a Japanese-style tatami platform area. Baby safety concerns include the loose pebble/gravel pathway in the entryway hallway (choking hazard), the elevated tatami platform with sharp edges, and large panoramic windows that need child-proofing. The unit has excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows, is very clean and well-maintained, but is mostly unfurnished; the high floor (15F/18F) in Xinyi strongly suggests elevator access."}
