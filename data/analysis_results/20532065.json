{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a street-level shophouse/storefront with a roll-up metal shutter at ground level, not a typical residential apartment. The interior shows a staircase leading upstairs, terrazzo flooring, and an unfurnished upper floor with wood flooring and balcony with security grilles. Baby safety concerns include the internal staircase between floors, which would require a gate. The building is an older 2-story structure with no elevator, requiring carrying a stroller up stairs."}
