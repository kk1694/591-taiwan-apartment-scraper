{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) with marble floors in the living area, recessed lighting, and modern kitchen with full-size refrigerator, gas stove, and microwave. The glass coffee table with sharp corners is a baby safety concern, and the smooth marble/tile floors could be slippery for a crawling child. The unit appears clean with good natural light from large windows, multiple bedrooms (including one suitable as a nursery), and at 51 ping on the 10th floor of a 12-story building it very likely has an elevator."}
