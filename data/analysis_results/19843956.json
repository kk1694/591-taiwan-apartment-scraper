{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a ground-floor commercial storefront converted for mixed use, with a street-level glass storefront entrance showing signs of aging and wear. Interior rooms show dated fixtures with tiled walls in bedrooms (unusual), dirty/stained walls, and older AC units. For a family with a baby, concerns include the non-residential nature of the property, limited natural light through small windows, visible water stains and poor wall condition, and the street-level entrance which may lack security. The price is high for the condition shown."}
