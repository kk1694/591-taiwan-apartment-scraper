{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin, near a river (likely Keelung River based on rooftop views)", "notes": "Very modern, newly built apartment in a high-end building with recessed LED lighting, clean white tile floors, modern glass-partitioned bathroom with rainfall shower and smart toilet. The unit is completely unfurnished with multiple rooms visible. The building features impressive communal amenities including a stylish lounge area and a beautifully landscaped rooftop garden with river views. Being on the 10th floor of a 16-story building confirms elevator access. For baby safety, the unit has smooth tile floors (slippery when wet), and the rooftop terrace has glass railings that would need supervision; the unfurnished state means no sharp furniture corners but parents would need to add child-proofing to door frames and electrical outlets near floor level."}
