{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly built apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, split AC units, and contemporary fixtures. The unit is unfurnished with multiple rooms showing good natural light through large floor-to-ceiling windows. Balcony railings appear to have adequate height but horizontal bars could be a climbing hazard for toddlers; the bathroom has a glass shower enclosure with sliding doors that would need childproofing."}
