{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Mixed condition apartment with a renovated living room featuring new flooring and AC, but older kitchen and two basic bathrooms showing wear. The kitchen uses a propane gas tank on an outdoor balcony area which could be a safety concern with a baby. The bathrooms have wet-floor designs with exposed drains - slippery tile floors are a concern. No visible stairs inside, but limited natural light overall."}
