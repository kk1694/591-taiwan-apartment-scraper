{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment in an upscale gated community with beautiful landscaped courtyard and mountain views. Clean condition with contemporary finishes including track lighting, light wood floors, and built-in storage. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light. For baby safety, the windows appear secure but the glass partition divider could be a concern; no visible balcony railings or stairs inside. Overall excellent condition with no red flags."}
