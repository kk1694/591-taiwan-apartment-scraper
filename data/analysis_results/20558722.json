{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Only a bathroom image is available, showing older but clean beige tile fixtures with a bathtub, pedestal sink, and toilet. The bathroom appears dated but reasonably maintained. The bathtub could pose a baby safety concern as it lacks non-slip surfaces; the listing is through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent) suggesting it may be foreigner-friendly, but at 70 ping on 7F/8F with very limited photos and a generic agent description, this listing lacks transparency and warrants further investigation before visiting."}
