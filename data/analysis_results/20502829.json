{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, glossy tile floors, built-in cabinetry, and a sleek modern kitchen with peninsula counter. The living area is very large with good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout would need rugs, and the open kitchen peninsula corners could be a concern; however, the flat layout with no visible stairs is a plus. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), so details on elevator and exact location are unclear — at 2F/6F in Da'an district, the building may or may not have an elevator."}
