{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a ground floor commercial or semi-commercial space with a roll-up metal shutter door, resembling a garage or storage unit rather than a residential apartment. The interior shows an old, dated kitchen with exposed pipes, a basic bathroom with aged fixtures, and a large empty basement-like space with very limited natural light (only small high windows). Major red flags for a family: appears to be a converted commercial space not suitable for residential use, minimal natural light, damp/basement conditions, and the ground floor location with metal shutter suggests security and safety concerns for a baby."}
