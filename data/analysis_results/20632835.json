{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "松江路140巷 (Songjiang Road Lane 140), near Songjiang Nanjing MRT Station (132-172m)", "notes": "Basic furnishings (簡易裝潢) suggest older/simple condition rather than modern renovation. Top floor (4F/4F) may have heat issues in summer. Spacious 4BR/2BA layout with balcony is good for a family. Located in excellent area very close to MRT with abundant amenities nearby. No interior photos available to assess baby safety concerns like balcony railings or sharp corners."}
