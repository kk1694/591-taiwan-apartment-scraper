{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near Taipei 101", "notes": "Upscale modern apartment on 15th floor with high-end finishes including recessed lighting, hardwood floors, leather sofas, a Japanese-style tatami room, and a well-equipped modern kitchen with large refrigerator and glass-front cabinetry. Excellent natural light from large panoramic windows with views of Taipei 101 and surrounding mountains. For baby safety, the raised tatami platform edge is a minor trip/fall hazard, and the glass coffee table has sharp corners that should be padded; however, windows appear to be fixed-pane which is good for child safety, and no dangerous balcony access is visible. Very clean and well-maintained, spacious at ~63 ping — an excellent choice for a family in a premium Xinyi location."}
