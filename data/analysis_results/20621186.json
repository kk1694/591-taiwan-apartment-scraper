{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, hotel-style studio apartment in excellent condition with wood-tone built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, pendant lamp, large double bed, sofa, TV, desk area, kitchenette with induction cooktop, microwave, fridge, and washing machine. The space is clean and well-maintained with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling curtained windows. For baby safety, the metal side table has sharp corners, and the open shelving under the TV/desk unit is at crawling height; at 17 ping this is a studio layout which may feel tight for a couple plus baby, and there is no visible separate bedroom for a nursery."}
