{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with sleek minimalist design, LED strip lighting, recessed ceiling lights, and contemporary furniture. The space is clean with smooth polished floors, open layout, and glass sliding doors to the bedroom area. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp-cornered furniture (metal side table, dining chairs) may need childproofing, but no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings. Natural light appears limited based on small windows shown."}
