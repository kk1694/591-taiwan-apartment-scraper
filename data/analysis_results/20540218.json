{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Very modern and well-finished apartment with clean, contemporary design. The bedroom features recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and a quality mattress. The bathrooms are high-end with stone-look tiling, glass shower partitions, modern tankless toilet, and sleek basin sinks. At 34.5 ping on the 7th floor of a 15-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the glass shower partition edges and hard tile bathroom floors could be concerns; only 3 photos are available so balcony, living area, and kitchen conditions are unknown — more images should be reviewed before committing. Listed through UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a foreign-friendly rental agency, which is a positive sign."}
