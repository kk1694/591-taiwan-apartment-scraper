{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern recessed lighting, clean tile floors, wall-mounted AC, and a wood-panel TV feature wall. The living room is spacious with a glass coffee table that has sharp edges and a glass-top design that could be a baby safety concern; the balcony has sliding glass doors that appear to lead to an open terrace on the 2nd floor which would need childproofing. Natural light comes through large balcony windows but appears somewhat limited by adjacent buildings. Overall the unit is clean and in good condition, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent advertisement) which is a minor red flag — more details should be confirmed directly."}
