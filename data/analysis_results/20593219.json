{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Well-renovated modern studio/1BR with clean finishes, new appliances (washer, fridge, microwave, AC), TOTO toilet, glass-separated shower, and built-in wardrobes. The unit is very clean and move-in ready, listed through UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly agency). For baby safety, the space is compact at ~30 sqm which limits crawling room; the glass shower partition and small dining chairs with sharp edges are minor concerns, but no dangerous balcony or stairs are visible. Natural light appears limited with small windows covered by roller blinds, and the overall space may feel tight for a couple with a baby."}
