{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, hotel-style apartment with high-end finishes including induction cooktop, TOTO smart toilet, LED-backlit bathroom mirror, and sleek built-in cabinetry. The bedroom appears to be a loft-style sleeping area with a low ceiling, which could feel cramped. The small balcony visible in image 1 has railings but the gaps should be checked in person for baby safety. The glass shower partition in the bathroom has no threshold tub, which is good for accessibility but the glass door would need child-proofing. Overall very clean and well-maintained, but the compact layout and loft bed design may be challenging with a baby. At 3F with no elevator info available, stroller access could be inconvenient."}
