{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with fresh white walls, new light-colored laminate flooring, modern LED ceiling lights, and an updated kitchen with gas stove and cabinetry. The unit is very clean and spacious at 30 ping, but appears completely empty with no furniture, and notably has exposed wiring visible in one room suggesting unfinished work. For baby safety, the flat floors with no stairs are good, but the small windows suggest limited natural light; the 2F location in a 12-story building makes elevator status uncertain and should be confirmed. The description is suspiciously minimal (just a generic agent ad for Sung-Hsin Real Estate), which is a minor red flag — ask the agent for full details on layout, amenities, and lease terms."}
