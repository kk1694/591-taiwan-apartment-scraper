{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment in excellent condition with updated fixtures, split AC units, and a well-equipped galley kitchen with stainless steel counters. Being on floor 15 of a 15-story building strongly indicates elevator access. For baby safety: the balcony door with floor-to-ceiling glass is a concern and would need child-proofing; no visible stairs or sharp corners, and the living space is fairly open with rounded furniture."}
