{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment with contemporary furnishings, split AC, flat-screen TV, modern kitchen with gas stove and range hood. Good natural light through floor-to-ceiling windows with sheer curtains. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp edges and the exposed ceiling pipes/conduits could be a minor concern, but overall the space is clean with smooth floors and no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access. The 14-floor building almost certainly has an elevator."}
