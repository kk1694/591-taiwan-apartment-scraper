{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with stylish recessed LED ceiling lighting, light wood-tone flooring, and contemporary furnishings including a grey sofa, wall-mounted TV, and marble-top dining table. The unit is on the 13th floor of a 26-story building, strongly indicating elevator access. The space appears clean and well-maintained with no visible stairs, sharp corners are minimal, and the flat layout is baby-friendly, though no bedroom, kitchen, or bathroom photos are shown—only the living/dining area is visible, and no windows or natural light sources are apparent in these photos, which is a concern. The description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), so layout details and additional features remain unknown; request more photos before committing."}
