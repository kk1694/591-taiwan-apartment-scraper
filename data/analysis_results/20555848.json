{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern recessed lighting, clean white walls, and tile flooring throughout. The spacious living area has good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, note the glass coffee table with sharp corners and balcony with railings visible in image 3 - both would need childproofing. Kitchen is functional but dated with gas stove."}
