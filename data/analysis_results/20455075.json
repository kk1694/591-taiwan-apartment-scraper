{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with contemporary furniture, recessed AC, and clean finishes throughout. The balcony has proper railings but sliding door access would need childproofing; coffee tables have sharp corners that pose a minor hazard for a crawling baby. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows; overall clean and move-in ready condition with no visible red flags."}
