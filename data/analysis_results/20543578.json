{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious and well-maintained apartment with polished hardwood floors, modern white kitchen with island counter, built-in oven, large stainless steel refrigerator, and pendant lighting. The living room features recessed ceiling lighting and a built-in TV console. The bedroom is large with a padded headboard wall and good natural light from multiple windows. At 60 ping this is excellent for a family; the open layout and smooth floors are baby-friendly, though the kitchen island edge and tile-to-wood floor transitions should be monitored. Being on the 4th floor of a 6-story building, it likely has no elevator (walk-up), which could be challenging with a stroller and baby gear."}
