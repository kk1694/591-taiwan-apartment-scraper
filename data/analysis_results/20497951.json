{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Older apartment with freshly painted walls and new laminate flooring but dated wooden wardrobe and aging infrastructure. The balcony has metal railings with wide gaps that are a serious baby safety hazard, and the rear utility area with exposed pipes, gas water heater, and unfinished surfaces looks rough. Being on 4F/4F with no elevator in an older walk-up building makes it impractical for a couple with a stroller. Only 3 photos shown suggest the listing may be hiding less appealing areas like the kitchen and bathroom."}
