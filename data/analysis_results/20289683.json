{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very well-maintained modern apartment with high-quality finishes including recessed LED lighting, marble-look tile floors, wall-mounted AC units, and a Dyson bladeless fan. The spacious living room has large windows providing good natural light and a leather sofa. The kitchen/dining area is well-equipped with gas stove, built-in oven, and ample counter space. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the glass-top dining table is also a concern; however, the floors are smooth and flat with no stairs visible. The 4th floor without confirmed elevator could be inconvenient with a stroller."}
