{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with marble-look tile floors and traditional wooden furniture; the living area is clean but dated with old-style AC units and fluorescent kitchen lighting. The balcony has full iron grille enclosure which is good for baby safety, but the kitchen has exposed gas stove piping and the rear service balcony is narrow with a washing machine and water heater in a somewhat cluttered arrangement. Natural light is decent from the front balcony sliding doors, though the overall finishes and appliances are aging and the description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag."}
