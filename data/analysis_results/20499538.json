{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu, near Dahu Park lake", "notes": "Luxurious, well-appointed apartment in a modern high-rise building with upscale European-style furnishings, marble accent walls, and polished tile floors. The view from the 12th floor overlooks what appears to be Dahu Park lake, providing excellent natural light through large windows. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners is a concern, and the decorative lattice room divider has openings a child could reach through; the slippery polished tile floors may also be a hazard for a crawling baby. Overall the unit is in excellent, clean condition with high-end finishes — a premium Neihu apartment."}
