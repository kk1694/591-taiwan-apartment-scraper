{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment with dated fixtures including older-style glass block partition, basic ceiling lights, and worn wooden wardrobes in bedroom. The unit shows signs of aging with visible wall marks near AC units and exposed cabling. For baby safety, the balcony visible in living room should be checked for railing height, and the glass coffee table with sharp corners poses a concern. Good natural light from large windows and the space is generally clean but would benefit from updates."}
