{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed/cove lighting, light wood-tone flooring, and a sleek black-framed glass partition separating the kitchen. The glass coffee table has sharp edges and the glass kitchen partition could be a concern for a baby; windows have security grilles which is good for child safety. Natural light appears moderate through barred windows; the space is very clean and spacious at 24 ping, but the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder) which is a minor red flag — verify layout details and whether bedrooms/bathrooms are included."}
