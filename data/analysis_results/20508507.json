{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "This is a top-floor (4F/4F) older walk-up apartment with a mix of renovated and dated elements. The bedroom has modern light-wood flooring and new wardrobe, but the kitchen has traditional dark wood cabinets and the bathroom is old-style with terrazzo walls and a built-in concrete bathtub. Major baby safety concerns: the rooftop terrace has low metal railings that a toddler could climb, the bathtub has hard edges, and being a 4th-floor walk-up with no elevator makes carrying a stroller very difficult. The apartment includes a large rooftop area and an upright piano, suggesting a spacious but aging building; natural light appears decent through frosted glass windows but overall the property feels dated for NT$56,000/month."}
