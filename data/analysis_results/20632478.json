{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Modern studio/1-bedroom apartment on 12F with recessed lighting, AC units, wood-laminate flooring, built-in kitchen with induction cooktop, washing machine, and refrigerator. Large mirrored wall makes the space feel bigger but the unit appears quite compact for 22 ping at NT$50k; the large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light and city views. For baby safety, the exposed TV mount wires and cables on the floor are a tripping/chewing hazard, the raised entryway step could be a fall risk, and the large mirror panels could be dangerous if broken; no balcony visible which is a plus for child safety."}
