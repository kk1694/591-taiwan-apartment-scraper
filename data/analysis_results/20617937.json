{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Clean, modern renovated apartment with white minimalist finishes, track lighting, light wood laminate floors, and updated kitchen with gas stove, range hood, and ample cabinetry. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent). The floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors to the balcony area are a baby safety concern and would need child locks; the exposed ceiling pipes and track lighting are high enough to not be an issue. The bathroom has glass sliding partitions which could be a hazard for a toddler. Overall very clean and well-maintained, spacious at 47 ping, on the 12th floor of a 19-story building which almost certainly has an elevator."}
