{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern fixtures including recessed lighting, AC units, and clean wood-look flooring. Living area has glass coffee table with sharp corners and bedroom wall shows some paint peeling/water damage that needs attention. Balcony area visible with sliding doors - would need baby gates. Good natural light from large windows and balcony. Overall clean but the bedroom wall condition is a minor concern."}
