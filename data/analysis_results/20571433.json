{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment in clean condition with modern recessed LED lighting, new tile flooring, updated kitchen with stainless steel countertops and gas stove, and a renovated bathroom with shower partition. At 41 ping on the top floor (7F/7F), it offers good natural light and open city views but being the top floor may mean heat issues and no confirmed elevator — climbing 7 floors with a baby and stroller would be a major concern. The unit appears baby-safe with flat open spaces and no visible stairs or dangerous railings, though the glass shelf in the bathroom and kitchen cabinet handles are minor hazards to address."}
