{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including recessed lighting, split AC, TOTO bathroom fixtures, glass shower partition, and sleek polished tile floors throughout. The unit is very spacious (64.54 ping) with abundant natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows on multiple sides and a balcony with proper door access. For baby safety, the polished tile floors could be slippery and would need rugs/mats; the balcony door should be secured with child locks, and the glass shower partition in the bathroom is a concern. No visible stairs, sharp corners are minimal, and the overall clean empty space is very baby-friendly once furnished. Being on 3F of an 11F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
