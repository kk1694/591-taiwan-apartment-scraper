{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This space has a heavily commercial/industrial aesthetic with exposed ceiling pipes, track lighting, dark painted ceilings, Hollywood-style vanity mirrors, and white brick walls — it looks like a former salon, studio, or office rather than a residential apartment. Not suitable for a couple with a baby: the industrial design with hard surfaces, exposed conduits, and lack of visible kitchen/bathroom/bedroom areas raises major red flags. Being on the top floor (6F/6F) with no confirmed elevator is also a concern. The description is essentially just an agent advertisement with no real property details."}
