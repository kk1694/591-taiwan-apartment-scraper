{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained, renovated apartment with modern kitchen featuring induction cooktop, recessed lighting, and quality cabinetry. Floor plan shows 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and a dressing room. Glass coffee table with sharp edges and many decorative items on shelves pose baby safety concerns. Good natural light through windows, but being on 5F/6F without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller and baby."}
