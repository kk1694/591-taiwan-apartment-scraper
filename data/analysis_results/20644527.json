{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with brand-new modern fixtures, recessed lighting, light grey wood-laminate flooring, split AC, and a minimalist white/grey aesthetic. The spacious open-plan living/dining area has smooth floors with no stairs and rounded-edge modern furniture, which is good for baby safety; furniture is still wrapped in protective plastic suggesting a fresh renovation. Natural light comes from a window/balcony area visible in the living room, though it appears to face other buildings limiting direct sunlight. The listing description is essentially empty (just a generic agent ad), which is a minor red flag — verify layout details (number of bedrooms/bathrooms) directly with the An-Ho Real Estate agent."}
