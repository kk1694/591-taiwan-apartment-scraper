{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, recently renovated apartment with modern minimalist style, light wood floors, and good natural light. Spacious living area with sectional sofa and massage chair. For baby safety: furniture has mostly rounded edges, but the climbing wall holds on the dining room wall could be a hazard for a curious toddler; no visible balcony railings or stairs in images. Some wall areas near the bedroom window show minor wear that may need attention."}
