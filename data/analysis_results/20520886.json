{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and well-maintained apartment with high ceilings, recessed lighting, split-type AC units, and a stylish open kitchen with breakfast bar. The unit appears to be a loft-style layout with internal stairs visible in images, which is a significant baby safety concern — stairs would need gating. The balcony has dark-framed railings visible through sliding glass doors. The bathroom is clean with glass shower partition and modern bidet toilet. Good natural light from windows with mountain views. Overall excellent condition but the internal staircase and loft design require careful childproofing."}
