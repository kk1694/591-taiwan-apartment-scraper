{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "This listing at NT$80,000/month for 18 ping in Zhongshan District appears to be a residential apartment on the 2nd floor of a 6-story building. The description only contains a generic agent advertisement with no meaningful details about the property's condition, amenities, or layout. Without images or a substantive description, it is impossible to assess modernity, baby safety features, natural light, or cleanliness — this listing is a red flag as it lacks transparency and may be a bait listing from an agent."}
