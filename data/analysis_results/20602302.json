{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment with minimalist white decor, polished tile floors, leather sofa, flat-screen TV, and contemporary chandelier. The space appears well-maintained with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the balcony has sliding glass doors with what appears to be standard railings; the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. No major red flags - the 18-floor building on floor 4 almost certainly has an elevator."}
