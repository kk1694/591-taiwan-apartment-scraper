{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with bright white walls, polished tile floors, and updated kitchen with modern cabinetry and appliances. The unit appears spacious with at least 2 bedrooms and good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the balcony door visible in the bedroom should be secured, and exposed electrical cords on walls need to be managed; otherwise the flat layout with no visible stairs is suitable for a growing family."}
