{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in a well-maintained high-rise building with recessed lighting, contemporary finishes, marble-look tile and light wood flooring. The 7-floor building clearly has an elevator. Good natural light from large windows with balcony access. For baby safety, balcony railings appear adequate but verify height; the floors are hard tile/wood so rugs would be advisable for a crawling baby. Very clean, move-in ready condition with no visible red flags."}
