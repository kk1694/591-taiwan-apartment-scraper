{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment with hardwood floors and decent natural light from large windows. The unit shows an older but well-maintained style with crown molding and wood paneling — not modern but clean. A notable baby safety concern is the raised platform/step area in the bedroom (image 5) which has unguarded steps that could be a fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler; the window grilles visible in the bedroom are a positive safety feature. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly agency), the description is minimal (just a sales pitch), so in-person viewing is essential to assess kitchen, bathrooms, and full layout of this large 38-ping Da'an unit."}
