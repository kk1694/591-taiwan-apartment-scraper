{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, spacious unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished white tile floors, recessed LED lighting, split AC units, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing abundant natural light. The space is completely empty which is a blank canvas but means all furniture must be purchased; the smooth tile floors could be slippery for a crawling baby. At 49 ping on floor 9 of 15 in Nangang, the building almost certainly has an elevator; balcony access visible behind curtains should be checked for railing safety once visiting in person."}
