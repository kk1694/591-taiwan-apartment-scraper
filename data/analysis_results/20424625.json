{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern hotel-style studio with high-end finishes including built-in oven, wine fridge, central AC, and stylish furniture. Clean and well-maintained with good recessed lighting. For baby safety: the glass bathroom partition and small balcony area visible through the window would need childproofing; the space is compact (30 sqm) which may feel cramped with baby gear, but there are no visible stairs or sharp corners of concern."}
