{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very spacious 63-ping unfurnished apartment in an older brick high-rise building (7F/9F) with elevator. The interior features dated 1990s-style decor with ornate ceiling moldings, marble entryway flooring, crystal light fixtures, and extensive wood cabinetry, but the hardwood floors and large windows with blinds provide decent natural light and a clean open layout. For baby safety, the polished marble and hardwood floors could be slippery, and the many glass sliding doors and mirrored surfaces in the entryway pose a concern; however, the open floor plan with no visible stairs is a plus, and the unit comes unfurnished so you could childproof as needed."}
