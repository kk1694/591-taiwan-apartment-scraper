{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment with elegant Asian-fusion decor, polished marble floors in living area, and hardwood flooring in bedroom. Very spacious layout with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the low platform bed and coffee table with rounded edges are positive, but the glass shelving and hard floor surfaces may need attention; no visible balcony railings or stairs to assess."}
