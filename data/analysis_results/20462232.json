{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment with classic parquet flooring and traditional fixtures. Clean condition but dated style with older ceiling details and built-in cabinetry. Good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety: no visible stairs or dangerous balconies in photos, but the raised bed platform in one room could be a fall hazard. Kitchen appears functional with modern appliances but narrow layout."}
