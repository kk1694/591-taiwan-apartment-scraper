{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment with clean light wood floors, open kitchen with breakfast bar, and good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Major baby safety concern: there is a steep metal ladder leading to an upper loft area which would be dangerous for a crawling baby or toddler and would require blocking off. The balcony has standard sliding glass doors. Overall clean and well-maintained condition with contemporary furnishings."}
