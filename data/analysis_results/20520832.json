{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Ronghua Park, Mingde Elementary School & Preschool, Post Office, 1st Road (一路), Beitou District", "notes": "No interior photos are provided — all 5 images show the surrounding neighborhood only (street view, Ronghua Park, Mingde Elementary School/Preschool, and a post office). The building exterior appears to be a typical older Taiwanese residential building (6F/9F). The neighborhood is family-friendly with a park and elementary school/preschool nearby, which is great for a couple expecting a baby. Cannot assess interior condition, baby safety features, natural light, or modernity without interior photos; the listing description is essentially empty (just a real estate agent ad), which is a red flag — request interior photos and a detailed description before visiting."}
