{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious older-style apartment with dated decor including terrazzo flooring and pink walls. The kitchen has been updated with red cabinets but the overall style is from the 1990s-2000s. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the unit has a raised platform/step between rooms that could be a tripping hazard. The space is clean but cluttered with personal belongings, and natural light appears limited in most rooms."}
