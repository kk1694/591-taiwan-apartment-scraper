{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, built-in ceiling AC, and contemporary built-in wardrobes. The unit appears to have at least 2-3 bedrooms plus a spacious living area, all in excellent condition. For baby safety, the balconies have vertical metal railings with narrow gaps which is good, and the large sliding glass doors have low thresholds; the floor-to-ceiling windows throughout should be checked for child locks. The apartment is mostly unfurnished which is a plus for customizing baby-proofing, and the 15-floor building on the 4th floor strongly suggests elevator access. No major red flags — clean, bright, and well-maintained."}
