{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is clearly a commercial office space, NOT a residential apartment. The images show drop ceiling tiles with fluorescent lighting, bare concrete/carpet-tile floors, commercial HVAC vents, and a large open-plan layout typical of an office. The space is completely empty and unfurnished with no kitchen or bathroom visible. Completely unsuitable for a couple expecting a baby — not designed for residential use, no living amenities, and the bare industrial flooring and exposed wiring present safety hazards."}
