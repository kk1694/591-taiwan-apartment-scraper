{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern apartment with clean tile floors, recessed ceiling lighting, open-plan living/dining area, a breakfast bar kitchen with AC, and a separate study room. The unit is on the 10th floor of a 13-story building, strongly suggesting elevator access. For baby safety, the large windows have floor-to-ceiling curtains but the balcony railings and window guards (visible in the kitchen area) appear secure; the sharp-cornered coffee table and metal-frame shelving would need baby-proofing. Good natural light from multiple large windows, overall very clean and well-maintained condition with no red flags."}
