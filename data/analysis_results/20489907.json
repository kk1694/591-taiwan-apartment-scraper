{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, modern kitchen with gas stove, range hood, and full-size fridge. At least two spacious bedrooms with large sliding-door wardrobes and vanity desks. The living room is large with floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the tile floors are slippery, windows have security grilles which is good, but the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. The kitchen has a barred rear door/window for ventilation. At 48 ping on the 10th floor of a 13-story building, an elevator is very likely. Clean and move-in ready, though the description is minimal (agent listing placeholder only)."}
