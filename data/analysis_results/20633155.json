{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated loft-style apartment with high ceilings, marble-look accent walls, LED ambient lighting, and clean neutral tones. Kitchen is compact but well-equipped with washer-dryer, induction cooktop, and Panasonic fridge. The loft/mezzanine design (visible glass transom above living area) likely means internal stairs to a second level, which is a significant baby safety concern requiring gates. Natural light appears limited with only a small kitchen window visible; overall very clean and well-maintained condition."}
