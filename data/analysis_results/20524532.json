{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment in a high-rise building (4F/26F) managed by UR House, a foreigner-friendly rental agency. The unit features a living room with L-shaped sofa, at least two bedrooms with built-in wardrobes, and a clean kitchen with induction cooktop, refrigerator, and microwave. The metal-frame coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the glossy tile floors throughout could be slippery for a crawling baby. No balcony is visible in the photos, which is a plus for baby safety, and the overall condition is very clean with recessed lighting and a neutral modern finish."}
