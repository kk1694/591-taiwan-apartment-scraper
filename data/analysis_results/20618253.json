{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale top-floor (11F) apartment in Beitou with modern finishes including hardwood flooring, recessed LED lighting, designer wall panels, open-plan kitchen, and floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light and city views. The glass coffee table with sharp metal edges and the large balcony sliding doors are baby safety concerns that would need childproofing; the metal bed frame in the bedroom also has protruding decorative elements. Overall the unit is very clean, spacious (38.63 ping), and in excellent condition — a high-end listing via Sung-Hsin Real Estate, though the minimal description suggests this is an agent placeholder listing so further details should be confirmed directly."}
