{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, light wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, and modern finishes throughout. The unit appears spacious at 30 ping with multiple rooms and good natural light from large frosted windows. For baby safety, the space has minimal sharp corners and no visible dangerous balcony access, though the unit is unfurnished so final assessment depends on furniture placement. No kitchen or bathroom shown in photos, which is a notable omission."}
