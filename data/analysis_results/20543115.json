{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu, near elevated highway/MRT line", "notes": "Very modern and well-renovated apartment with recessed ceiling lighting, concrete accent wall, large-format polished floor tiles, and built-in cabinetry including entryway storage. The living area is clean and spacious with good natural light from large windows, though the view faces an elevated highway or MRT structure which may cause noise concerns. For baby safety, the floors are smooth and flat with no stairs visible, and windows appear to have secure frames, but the low coffee table edges and exposed cables near the TV console would need child-proofing. The current tenant appears to have a small dog, and overall the unit is in excellent condition with a modern minimalist aesthetic."}
