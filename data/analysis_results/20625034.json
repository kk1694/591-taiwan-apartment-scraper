{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with quality wood flooring, recessed lighting, modern AC units, and clean white walls. The space is very baby-friendly with no visible sharp corners, stairs, or dangerous balcony access - all rooms appear to be on a single level with floor-to-ceiling windows behind safe curtains. Being on floor 13 of a 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access; good natural light from large windows with mountain views."}
