{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with sleek designer finishes including recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, glossy white kitchen with induction cooktop, and contemporary furniture. The raised platform entry to one bedroom and the glass bathroom partition are baby safety concerns — the step-up could cause falls for a toddler and the glass door needs child-proofing. Natural light appears limited based on nighttime photos with small windows visible; the living area is compact but well-designed. Building is 14 floors so almost certainly has an elevator, and the unit is very clean and move-in ready."}
