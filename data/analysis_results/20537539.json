{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District, near riverside park (likely Dajia Riverside Park area, view of Taipei 101 skyline)", "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with white walls, polished tile floors, AC units in bedrooms, and a spacious living/dining area. The balcony overlooks a riverside park with a stunning city skyline view including Taipei 101. For baby safety: the balcony has metal railings with horizontal bars that a toddler could potentially climb—this is a concern on the 10th floor. One bedroom appears quite small (single bed only), while the master bedroom is a decent size. The apartment is clean and well-maintained but sparsely furnished; no sharp corners visible, and the flat layout with no stairs is good for a family with a baby."}
