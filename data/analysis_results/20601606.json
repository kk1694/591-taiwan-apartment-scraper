{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with sleek black-and-white interior design, polished tile floors, leather sofa, wall-mounted TV, split AC, and crystal chandelier fixtures. The living room is spacious with sliding glass doors leading to what appears to be a balcony; the bedroom has good natural light with floor-to-ceiling sheer curtains. For baby safety, the hard tile floors in the living area and sharp corners on the marble dining table and glass coffee table are concerns; the sliding glass balcony door will need a child lock. Being on 4F of an 18F building strongly suggests elevator access. The description is minimal (agent listing placeholder) so no additional details on layout or amenities are available."}
