{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern unfurnished apartment with bright white tile floors, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC units, and a balcony with floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. The unit appears newly renovated with no visible safety concerns for babies - no stairs visible, balcony has proper railings, and the open floor plan has minimal sharp corners. Being on the 12th floor of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
