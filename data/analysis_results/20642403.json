{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and well-renovated apartment with upscale finishes including marble-look accent walls, crystal chandelier, recessed ceiling lighting, and glossy tile floors. The unit features a separate bedroom with a raised tatami-style platform, an open living area, a compact but well-equipped kitchen with gas stove and range hood, and a rear balcony with washing machine. Baby safety concerns include the raised bedroom platform edge, the glass display cabinets with sharp corners, and the bar stool which is unstable; the balcony appears to have proper railing. Excellent natural light from multiple large windows on the 11th floor with city views, and the overall condition is very clean and move-in ready."}
