{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, upscale unfurnished apartment with high-end finishes including dark hardwood floors, recessed LED lighting, stone countertop bathroom vanity, built-in kitchen with washing machine, microwave, range hood, and central air conditioning. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with a sleek contemporary design. For baby safety, the dark floors are smooth hardwood (slippery risk), the apartment is on the 9th floor so window/balcony access behind the floor-to-ceiling curtains needs checking, and there are low electrical outlets along the walls that would need childproofing. The listing description is minimal (just a broker promotion ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and lease terms."}
