{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment on 12F/26F in Wanhua with contemporary built-in cabinetry, recessed LED lighting, light wood laminate flooring, and a clean modern bathroom with bidet toilet. The living room has large floor-to-ceiling sliding windows with a balcony and good city views; the bedrooms are quite small with only single mattresses, which may be tight for a couple. For baby safety, the large balcony sliding doors will need child locks, and the bedrooms appear to have minimal sharp corners; however, the listing is mostly unfurnished and the description is essentially just an agent advertisement with no real details, which is a minor red flag."}
