{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with mixed condition - living area has clean white tile floors but one bedroom has visibly worn walls with water stains/damage and dated tile walls with pink flooring. Other bedrooms appear cleaner with dark hardwood floors. Limited natural light visible (small high windows with security bars). For baby safety: floors are hard tile/wood without padding, no visible stairs but minimal furniture protection. The overall condition is fair but the bedroom with wall damage is a concern for a family with an infant."}
