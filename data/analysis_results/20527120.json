{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment in Xinyi with clean white walls, wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, designer Togo-style leather sofas, glass coffee table, wall-mounted AC, and a decorative chandelier. The glass coffee table has sharp edges which is a baby safety concern, and the large floor-to-ceiling window/balcony door behind curtains should be checked for secure railings. Only the living/dining area is shown across all four photos — no bedroom, kitchen, or bathroom views are provided, which is a red flag for a 25-ping unit listed through an agent ad with minimal description."}
