{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment in a luxury building with rooftop pool. The unit features high ceilings, contemporary furnishings, and good natural light. Major baby safety concerns: the loft has an open mezzanine with only low railings visible, and there are metal stairs leading to the upper level which would be hazardous for a crawling baby or toddler. The space is clean and well-maintained but quite compact for a growing family."}
