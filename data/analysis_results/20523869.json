{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture. The space is bright, well-maintained, and features built-in storage cabinets, AC units, and a modern bathroom with glass shower. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is good, but the coffee table has some sharp corners that may need padding, and the venetian blinds have cords that could be a hazard."}
