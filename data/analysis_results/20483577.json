{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment on the top floor (5F/5F) of a walk-up building with dated parquet flooring, old window-unit AC, and frosted glass windows throughout. The unit is spacious (42.54 ping) and completely unfurnished with clean white walls, but shows its age with green baseboards and older light fixtures. For baby safety, the balcony with sliding glass doors and low railings is a concern, and the top-floor location with no elevator will be very difficult when carrying a baby and stroller; natural light appears limited due to frosted/opaque windows in most rooms."}
