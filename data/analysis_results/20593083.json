{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with recessed LED lighting, wall-mounted AC, sleek TV feature wall, and updated kitchen with dish dryer and glass backsplash. The unit appears to be a duplex/loft layout with an internal staircase and metal railing visible in image 4, which is a significant baby safety concern — the stairs and open railing would need child gates and could be dangerous for a crawling infant. The apartment is clean with good natural light from large sliding glass balcony doors, and at 30 ping on the 4th floor of a 10-story building it likely has elevator access."}
