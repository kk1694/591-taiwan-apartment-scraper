{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern Scandinavian-style interior, light wood flooring, recessed lighting, ceiling fan, and clean white cabinetry. The space is spacious at 34.52 ping with an open living-dining layout, well-equipped kitchen area with fridge, microwave, and rice cooker. For baby safety, note the staircase railing visible in image 2 (appears to be a duplex/top-floor unit with roof access) which would need baby gates; the coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but the balcony door in image 3 with metal grille bars should be checked. Being on the top floor (7F/7F) with no confirmed elevator is a concern for stroller access, and the listing description is essentially just an agent advertisement with no real property details, which is a minor red flag."}
