{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious luxury apartment in excellent condition with polished marble floors in living area and hardwood in bedrooms, central AC, recessed lighting, and built-in storage. Good natural light from large windows with balcony access; 7th floor of 21-story building strongly suggests elevator. For baby safety, the balcony with low planter area may need attention, but overall the open layout with no stairs and minimal sharp corners is family-friendly."}
