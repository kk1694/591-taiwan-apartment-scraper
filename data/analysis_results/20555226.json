{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment in Zhongzheng district with clean white tile floors, recessed LED lighting, leather sofa, glass coffee table, dining area, and a sleek modern kitchen with SAMPO fridge, range hood, and glass backsplash. The glass coffee table with sharp metal legs and the balcony door access from the living room are baby safety concerns worth noting. At 35 ping on the 2nd floor of a 13-story building (likely has elevator), this is a spacious, clean unit with decent natural light from the floor-to-ceiling balcony windows, though the description is just a generic agent ad with no real property details."}
