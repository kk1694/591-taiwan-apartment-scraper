{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, wood panel walls, designer furniture, and modern kitchen with dishwasher and washing machine. The space is very clean with good natural light through large windows. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp edges that would need covering, but overall the open-plan layout has minimal hazards with no visible stairs or balcony concerns in these images."}
