{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with sleek built-in cabinetry, hardwood flooring, recessed lighting, and stylish glass/chrome furniture throughout. The living room is spacious with large windows providing good natural light, and the bedroom features a sloped ceiling/wall with decorative diagonal paneling suggesting a top-floor unit. Baby safety concerns include the glass coffee table and dining table with sharp metal corners, large glass partition panels in the dining area, and the open stairway-like diagonal structure in the bedroom; the glass table edges would need corner guards. Being on 8F/8F (top floor), potential concerns include roof leaks and summer heat, and no bedroom/bathroom photos suggest limited views of the full unit."}
