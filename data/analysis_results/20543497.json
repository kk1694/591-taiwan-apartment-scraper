{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean white walls, polished tile floors, stylish furniture, modern bathroom with glass shower partition, and a separate enclosed kitchen. The space is spacious at ~46 ping with at least 2 bedrooms, a dining area, and open living room with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the hard tile floors may need rugs; however, the layout is open and flat with no stairs, and windows appear to have secure frames. The 2nd floor in a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
