{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with recessed ceiling lighting, hardwood flooring, designer Togo-style leather sofas, Noguchi glass coffee table, wall-mounted TV, and split AC unit. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and low leather furniture are baby safety concerns; the table corners would need padding. Only the living/dining area is shown (no bedroom, kitchen, or bathroom photos), which is a red flag — at 18.5 ping for NT$40k in Xinyi this is agent-listed and photos are limited. Natural light appears moderate from the single window; building is 9F/13F suggesting an elevator building."}
