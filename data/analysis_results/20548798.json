{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wenshan District", "notes": "Spacious modern apartment in a well-maintained 13-floor building with elevator. Interior features recessed lighting, polished tile floors, leather sofa, dark wood cabinetry, and a glass-partitioned en-suite bathroom in the master bedroom. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that need padding, and the transparent glass bathroom partition in the bedroom could be a concern for a crawling toddler; the building exterior shows balconies with adequate railings. The apartment is clean and in good condition with decent natural light, though the listing description is minimal (just a broker ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and included amenities."}
