{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nanjing East Road Section 5, Lane 66, Songshan District, near Nanjing Sanmin MRT Station", "notes": "Renovated 3BR/2BA apartment on 1F of a 7-floor elevator building with full furnishings including fridge, washer, AC, and sofa. Being on the first floor is convenient for a stroller but may have less natural light and more street noise; check window security and balcony railing height for baby safety. Cooking is allowed with natural gas which is a plus, but no pets are permitted; the listing appears well-maintained and modern after renovation, though the description is minimal (mostly an agent advertisement) so an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
