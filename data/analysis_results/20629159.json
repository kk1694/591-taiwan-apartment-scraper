{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment in Da'an district with designer finishes including herringbone flooring, recessed lighting, built-in pink shelving, and a walk-in closet with glass sliding doors. The unit appears very clean and well-maintained, listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency). For baby safety, the open shelving unit has some sharp corners and glass doors on the closet could be a concern; the bedroom has floor-to-ceiling curtained windows that may indicate a balcony door requiring childproofing. Natural light appears good with large windows in both living and bedroom areas. At NT$100K/month for 19 ping, this is premium expat-targeted housing but the description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and amenities."}
