{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "This appears to be a multi-story townhouse (透天厝) rather than a standard apartment, with a street-level entrance opening directly onto the sidewalk and an internal wooden staircase. The ground floor has a bare tiled kitchen area with no appliances and the space feels more like a former shophouse or mixed-use property. Major baby safety concerns include the steep wooden staircase with wide railing gaps, the street-level glass sliding doors opening directly to traffic, and limited natural light with barred windows; the bedrooms upstairs are sparsely furnished with basic mattresses and the overall condition is dated and bare."}
