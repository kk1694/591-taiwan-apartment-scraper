{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This is an unusually large open-plan space with commercial/industrial aesthetic - exposed ceiling pipes, track lighting, and extensive wooden shelving suggests it may have been converted from commercial use. For baby safety: the balcony railings appear adequate but the open shelving units throughout could be tipping hazards, and the spiral staircase visible in image 4 is a significant concern. Good natural light from multiple windows, clean condition with modern AC units and kitchen island."}
