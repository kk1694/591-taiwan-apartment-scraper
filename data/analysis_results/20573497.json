{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei 101, Xinyi District", "notes": "Older 1990s-style apartment with dated wood cabinetry and marble accents. Spacious living area but the decor is vintage. The bathroom shows some yellowing/staining on the tub which suggests aging fixtures. For baby safety: hard tile floors throughout, built-in glass display cabinets with sharp corners, and the bathtub has no visible safety features. The view shows Taipei 101 very close, confirming excellent Xinyi location."}
