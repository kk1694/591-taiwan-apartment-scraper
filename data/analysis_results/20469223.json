{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment in clean condition with polished tile floors, multiple rooms, and AC units. The unit has good natural light from large windows with curtains, and a balcony door with diamond-pattern safety grilles visible in the bedroom. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings with narrow gaps which is positive, but the tile floors are very slick and the unit is completely empty so condition of bathrooms is unknown. The kitchen cabinets and fixtures appear dated (older-style wall-mount AC, basic lighting, traditional cabinet design), placing this as a well-maintained but not modern apartment; the description is essentially just an agent advertisement with no useful details, which is a minor red flag."}
