{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including old-style window AC units and basic tile flooring. The unit is unfurnished and reasonably clean but shows its age with dated light fixtures, narrow strip windows, and worn closet doors. For baby safety, the space is generally flat with no visible stairs, but the hard tile floors and lack of visible balcony railings in photos require inspection; limited natural light due to small windows could be a concern."}
