{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained modern apartment on the 15th floor with recessed LED ceiling lighting, hardwood floors, large leather sectional sofa, and a clean modern kitchen with glass-front cabinets, LG refrigerator, and built-in Electrolux dishwasher. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with mountain views. For baby safety, note the low balcony railings visible through the sheer curtains in the bedroom area and the glass coffee table with sharp corners in the living room; the sliding frosted glass room dividers have no locks which a toddler could open. Overall a high-end, clean unit in a premium Xinyi District high-rise building."}
