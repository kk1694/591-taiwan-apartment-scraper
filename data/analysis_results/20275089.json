{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with parquet hardwood floors, well-maintained and clean. The living and dining areas are very large at 42.6 ping, with decent natural light from balcony doors. For baby safety, the hardwood floors are slippery, the coffee table has sharp edges, the bedroom has only a single bed which is too small for a couple, and the balcony access would need child-proofing; the intercom system and overall condition suggest a well-managed but dated building from the 1990s era."}
