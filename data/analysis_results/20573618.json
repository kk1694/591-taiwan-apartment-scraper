{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "This is a 20.81 ping (68.7 sqm) apartment on the 10th floor of a 22-story building in Xinyi District, priced at NT$58,000/month. The high-rise building almost certainly has an elevator. The listing description appears to be a generic promotional message for real estate agents rather than an actual property description, which is a red flag — there is no meaningful detail about the apartment's condition, layout, fixtures, or amenities, making it impossible to assess modernity, baby safety features (balcony railings, sharp corners, stairs), or natural light from the provided information alone."}
