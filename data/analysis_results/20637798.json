{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxuriously renovated apartment with European-style white decor, marble accents, chandeliers, and high-quality finishes throughout. Major baby safety concern: there is a loft/mezzanine area accessed by stairs with glass railings that could be dangerous for a crawling toddler, and the glass coffee table has sharp corners. Good natural light from large windows, very clean condition, but the all-white surfaces and ornate furniture may be impractical with a baby."}
