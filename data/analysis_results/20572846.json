{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in pristine condition with high-gloss tile floors, recessed LED lighting, modern pendant fixtures, built-in TV wall unit, and split AC units. The unit is very spacious at 65 ping with large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors providing abundant natural light and greenery views. Listed through UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a foreigner-friendly rental agency. For baby safety: the polished tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling/toddling baby, and the large sliding glass doors leading to what appears to be a balcony would need child-proof locks; however, the open layout with minimal sharp corners is a plus. The apartment is unfurnished, which allows flexibility for baby-proofing. An 11-story building on the 3rd floor very likely has an elevator."}
