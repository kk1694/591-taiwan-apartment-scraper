{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is clearly a commercial office space, NOT a residential apartment. It features drop ceiling tiles with fluorescent panel lighting, ceiling-mounted cassette air conditioning units, reception counters with glass partitions, checkered carpet tiles, and office-style blinds — all hallmarks of a commercial office. Completely unsuitable for a couple expecting a baby as it lacks any residential features such as a kitchen, bathroom fixtures, or living areas. The listing description also references a real estate agent sales package (售屋套餐), further suggesting this is a commercial/agent listing rather than a genuine residential rental."}
