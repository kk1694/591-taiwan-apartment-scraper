{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern track lighting, new wood-look flooring, and freshly painted white walls. The kitchen is basic but functional with a range hood and gas stove. The balcony has full safety mesh/grille enclosure which is excellent for baby safety. Natural light is good with multiple windows throughout. The space is clean and move-in ready, though unfurnished. No visible stairs or sharp corners inside; the small step near the kitchen area is minor."}
