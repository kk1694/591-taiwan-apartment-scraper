{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment managed by UR House (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). Clean open-plan living area with modern kitchen island, AC units, and contemporary fixtures. Bedroom is spacious with double bed and vanity. The living room has a balcony with sliding glass doors — balcony railing safety should be verified in person. No obvious sharp corners or major hazards, but the low coffee table and kitchen island edges could need padding for a crawling baby. Good natural light from windows in both living room and bedroom. Being on 2F of a 5F walkup, no elevator is confirmed — carrying a stroller up stairs daily could be inconvenient."}
