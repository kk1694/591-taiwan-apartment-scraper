{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, professionally managed apartment with excellent natural light, modern fixtures, crystal chandelier, open-plan living with kitchen bar, hardwood floors throughout. Very clean condition with rounded furniture edges. For baby safety, the large balcony access with floor-to-ceiling windows needs childproofing; the bar stools are a tipping hazard. Being on 7F/7F (top floor), elevator status is uncertain but likely given the building quality."}
