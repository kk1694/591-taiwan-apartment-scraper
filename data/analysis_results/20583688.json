{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, very modern apartment with clean white finishes, recessed lighting, built-in AC, and a well-equipped kitchen with gas stove. The unit features glass partition walls and polished tile floors throughout. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners to consider, and the large glass sliding doors may need childproofing; however, no visible balcony railings or stairs pose immediate risks. Excellent natural light from large windows."}
