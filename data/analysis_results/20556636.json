{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern unfurnished apartment with glossy white tile floors, wall-mounted AC units, a built-in kitchen with oven, and a well-appointed bathroom with bathtub and ventilation fan. The 15-story building on floor 4 almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the polished tile floors could be slippery and the bathtub lacks a guard, but the space is open with no visible stairs or sharp corners; the large windows have sturdy dark-framed panels. At 65 ping this is very spacious but the listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — confirm actual room count and lease terms directly."}
