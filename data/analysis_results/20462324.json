{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean white finishes, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, flat-screen TV, washing machine, full kitchen with dish rack, and ample built-in wood-tone storage. The space is bright and well-maintained but appears compact for a couple with a baby; the open kitchen layout and lack of visible separate bedroom door may limit baby-proofing options. No balcony visible (window appears sealed), which is safer for a child but limits drying space and ventilation; the 9th floor in a 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
