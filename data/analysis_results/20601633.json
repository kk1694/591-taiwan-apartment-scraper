{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed LED ceiling lighting, wall-mounted AC, built-in TV cabinet, and clean white tile flooring. The unit appears to be a large studio or 1-bedroom with an open kitchen visible behind glass partition; a child's yellow chair is already present suggesting family-friendliness. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, the open kitchen area with mosaic tile backsplash is directly accessible, and the glass partition near the kitchen could be a concern; however the flat layout with no stairs and good natural light from multiple windows are positives. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), which is a good sign for an expat couple."}
