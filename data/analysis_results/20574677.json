{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean but dated apartment with older-style kitchen cabinets and fixtures from the 1990s-2000s era. The living areas have white tile floors and AC units, but the kitchen shows its age with yellowing cabinetry. Good natural light from large balcony windows; the balcony has full-height glass railings which is safer for children. No stairs visible, single-level layout appears baby-friendly with few sharp corners, though the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from area rugs for a crawling baby."}
