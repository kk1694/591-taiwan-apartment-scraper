{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Relatively modern apartment in a newer building with clean white walls, tile floors, floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors, and split AC units. The unit has at least 2 bedrooms plus a living/dining area with open kitchen — good size at 28 ping for a growing family. Baby safety concerns include multiple balconies with horizontal railing bars that a toddler could climb, and the open kitchen layout means easy access to stove/appliances. Natural light is excellent with large windows in every room, though the adjacent building is quite close which reduces privacy."}
