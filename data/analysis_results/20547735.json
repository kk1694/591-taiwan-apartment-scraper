{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment with high-end finishes, recessed lighting, and quality furniture. The space is very clean with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners and the window bay seating area may need child-proofing; no visible balcony concerns. Overall a well-maintained unit suitable for a family."}
