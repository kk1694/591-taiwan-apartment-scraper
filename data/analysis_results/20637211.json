{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Daan Park Station (大安森林公園站)", "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment with older fixtures and basic ceiling lights. Clean white walls and tile floors but dated overall. Being on the 1st floor eliminates stair concerns for baby safety, and the large open layout is good for families, though the metal security grilles on windows and sliding doors may have gaps requiring childproofing. Natural light appears moderate through the balcony doors."}
