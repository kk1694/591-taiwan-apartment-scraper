{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean and well-renovated apartment with European-style white cabinetry, polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and wall-mounted AC units. The spacious living area has extensive built-in storage with glass-front display cabinets, and the galley kitchen features modern countertops, range hood, and a window for ventilation. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery and the glass cabinet doors with metal handles are at low height; the open floor plan is mostly safe with no visible stairs, but glass cabinet panels and sharp cabinet corners would need childproofing. Natural light appears moderate from windows visible in the living room and kitchen areas."}
