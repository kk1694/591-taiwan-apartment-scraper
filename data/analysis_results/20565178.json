{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with European-style interior design, hardwood floors, modern bathroom with glass shower partition, and a bright L-shaped kitchen with dishwasher and gas stove. The space is very clean, well-lit with large windows, and features at least two bedrooms (one visible through glass sliding doors from the living/dining area). For baby safety, the glass bedroom partition and glass shower door could be concerns; the kitchen tile floor has a floor drain that should be covered. Overall an excellent, high-quality unit on the 8th floor of a 12-story building (very likely to have an elevator), ideal for a family in the premium Da'an district."}
