{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, built-in TV wall unit with dark wood cabinetry, recessed and pendant lighting, central air conditioning, and large windows providing good natural light. The 62-ping space is very spacious for a family with 4 bedrooms; the floors are smooth tile which is easy to clean but slippery for a crawling baby, and the balcony railings visible through windows appear to have narrow horizontal bars which should be checked for child safety. No visible stairs, sharp corners appear minimal, and the overall condition is move-in ready and very clean."}
