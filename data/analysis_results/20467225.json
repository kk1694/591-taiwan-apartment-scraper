{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious older apartment (54 ping) with dated fixtures including old-style wall sconces, ceiling lights, wall-mounted AC units, and dark marble baseboards throughout. The unit is mostly unfurnished with wood laminate flooring in decent condition and large windows/balcony doors providing natural light. For baby safety, the balcony access doors in the bedroom should be secured, and the structural columns with sharp dark-marble edges throughout the living area are a concern; the built-in wooden wardrobes in the bedroom appear sturdy but dated. Overall clean but clearly an older building with no visible elevator — at 4F/5F with no elevator clues, carrying a stroller up would be a significant daily challenge."}
