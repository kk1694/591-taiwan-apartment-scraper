{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with extensive custom oak wood cabinetry and built-in furniture throughout, giving it a dated 1990s Taiwanese aesthetic. The floors are light laminate (newer) but the heavy wooden cabinets, wall-mounted AC units, and flush-mount light fixtures are clearly older. The living room has large sliding glass doors to a balcony with metal railings — balcony access and the raised bed platform in the bedroom are baby safety concerns. Being on 6F/6F with no clear elevator indication, carrying a stroller up could be challenging. Natural light appears moderate; one room has a cloth covering the window suggesting potential issues with the view or sun exposure."}
