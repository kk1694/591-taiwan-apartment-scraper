{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including hardwood floors, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and large windows providing good natural light. The living area and bedrooms appear clean with updated fixtures. For baby safety, windows have security grilles which is positive, but the open kitchen pass-through shelving with glass items and sharp corner edges on built-in furniture would need childproofing. The separate laundry area on a rear balcony has metal security bars."}
