{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-renovated apartment in Da'an with modern finishes including recessed lighting, central AC, clean white tile flooring, a galley kitchen with gas stove and ample cabinetry, and a built-in study/second bedroom with desk and storage platform. The unit appears very clean with good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard (consider padding), the raised platform bed in the study room has sharp edges, and the kitchen is an open galley style that may need a gate; no visible dangerous balcony access but windows should be checked for child locks."}
