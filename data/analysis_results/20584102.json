{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes, recessed LED lighting, minimalist design, and spacious open-plan living/dining area with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. The kitchen features modern appliances including built-in microwave/oven. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery; no visible sharp corners on furniture, though the metal-frame dining furniture has angular edges. No stairs visible and the unit appears single-level. Being on floor 5 of a 9-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
