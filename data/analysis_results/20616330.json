{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with sleek finishes including recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and a fully updated galley kitchen with red cabinets and gas stove. Good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety: note the wooden climbing structure with ropes in the living room which would need removal, and the slippery tile floors throughout. Being on the 6th floor of a 6-story building without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller."}
