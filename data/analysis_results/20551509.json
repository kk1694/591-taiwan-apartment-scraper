Large open living area with polished tile floors and good natural light from large windows with balcony access. For baby safety, the sliding glass balcony doors and hard tile floors throughout main areas are concerns; bathroom has glass shower enclosure with raised threshold. Building appears to have elevator (12-story building, 8th floor unit)."}
