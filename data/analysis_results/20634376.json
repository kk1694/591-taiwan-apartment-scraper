{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "This is a multi-story townhouse (透天) with internal wooden staircase, not a standard apartment. The ground floor has a street-facing glass storefront entrance suggesting possible prior commercial use, and the interior is sparsely furnished with basic older fixtures. Major baby safety concerns: the steep wooden staircase with wide railing gaps is a serious hazard for a crawling/toddling child, and the ground floor opens directly onto the street. Natural light is limited on the ground floor (barred windows), and the bedrooms are small with minimal windows; overall the property feels dated and would require significant baby-proofing."}
