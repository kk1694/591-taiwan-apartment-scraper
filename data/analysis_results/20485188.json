{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Well-maintained, modern apartment with updated fixtures including split AC units, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and a fully equipped kitchen with large stainless steel refrigerator and gas cooktop. At 30 ping with multiple bedrooms (at least two visible with en-suite bathroom), this is spacious for a growing family. The apartment appears clean with no major baby safety red flags visible — windows have security grilles in the living room, floors are smooth tile and hardwood, and the marble coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding; the living room windows show iron railings which is reassuring. Natural light appears moderate based on window sizes. Being on the 4th floor of a 14-floor building strongly suggests elevator access."}
