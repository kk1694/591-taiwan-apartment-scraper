{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "High-end, modern apartment with premium finishes including marble entry, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and a spacious open-plan living area with modern kitchen. The bedroom features an en-suite bathroom visible through glass partition and ample built-in storage. There is a loft/mezzanine space with low ceiling and wood flooring that could serve as extra storage or play area but has baby safety concerns due to potential access stairs/ladder. The coffee table has sharp corners and the polished tile floors may be slippery—both worth noting for a crawling baby. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly agency), which is a positive sign, though the description is minimal (agent boilerplate only). Natural light appears moderate from window areas; overall very clean and well-maintained."}
