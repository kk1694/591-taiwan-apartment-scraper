{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with designer finishes including marble TV wall, herringbone dark wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, built-in kitchen with modern appliances, and sleek cabinetry. The space is large and open-plan at 47 ping. For baby safety, the dark herringbone flooring appears hard and slippery which could be a concern for a crawling baby; the open kitchen layout lacks barriers, and the floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access would need childproofing. Natural light is decent from the large windows but appears somewhat limited by surrounding buildings. The apartment appears to be in an upscale building (11 floors, 3F) which almost certainly has an elevator. Note: the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request full details directly."}
