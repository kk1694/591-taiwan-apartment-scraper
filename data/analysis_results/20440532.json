{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang", "notes": "Modern, stylishly furnished apartment with open-plan living area, light wood flooring, large windows with blinds providing good natural light, and a kitchen bar counter with high stools. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). For a baby, the high bar stools and open kitchen layout are concerns; the space appears clean and well-maintained but only one image is available so full baby-safety assessment is limited. Being on 8F/13F strongly suggests elevator access."}
