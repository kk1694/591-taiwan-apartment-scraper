{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, polished tile floors, split AC units, and contemporary furniture throughout. At 48 ping on the 10th floor of a 13-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator and offers a spacious layout with living room, dining area, study/bar nook, and bedroom. For baby safety, the large windows have secure frames but the bar-height counter in the study area and glass coffee table edges are potential concerns; the open floor plan and smooth tile floors are generally good but slippery, and the balcony area near the kitchen has metal grating that should be checked for gaps."}
