{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale European-style furnished apartment in excellent condition with crystal chandeliers, ornate crown molding, open kitchen with wine glass rack, and elegant bedroom furniture. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide abundant natural light. For baby safety, the glass side tables with sharp edges, low-hanging crystal chandeliers, and the open kitchen layout with accessible cabinets would need childproofing; no visible balcony railings or stairs in photos, and the smooth tile/hardwood floors are easy to clean. The 12th floor of a 19-story building almost certainly has an elevator, and at 53.7 ping this is a spacious, well-maintained unit, though the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag worth clarifying."}
