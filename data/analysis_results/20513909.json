{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, upscale apartment with ornate ceiling details, crystal chandelier, black marble TV accent wall, and light wood flooring — clean and well-maintained condition. The large open living area is very baby-friendly with smooth floors and no visible stairs or sharp corners, though the low glass coffee table with ornate legs may need corner protectors. Good natural light from large curtained windows on one side; managed by UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly rental agency), and at 45 ping in Da'an this is a premium unit, though only photos of the living room are shown — no kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom views which is a minor red flag."}
