{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including wood laminate flooring, recessed AC units, a designer open kitchen with island, and clean minimalist aesthetics. Notably includes a dedicated children's play area with a raised platform, play tent, and toys — ideal for a family with a baby. The raised platform edge could be a minor trip/fall hazard for a crawling toddler but has rounded corners. Good natural light through large curtained windows. Bathroom is modern with glass-partitioned wet/dry separation. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agent) at NT$70,000 for 53 ping in Wenshan, which is reasonable for this quality level."}
