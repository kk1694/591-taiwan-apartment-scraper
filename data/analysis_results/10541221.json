{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with recessed ceiling AC, built-in wooden cabinetry, leather sofa, and quality finishes throughout. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with mountain views. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners, the bathtub near a large window may need supervision, and balcony access should be secured; overall the unit is clean and spacious with no stairs."}
