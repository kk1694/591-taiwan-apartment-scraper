{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, spacious living area with sleek recessed/track lighting, polished tile floors, large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a balcony, and quality furnishings including L-shaped sofa set and dining table. The glass coffee table has sharp metal edges which are a concern for a crawling baby, and the balcony glass doors would need child-proof locks. The apartment is extremely clean and well-maintained; at 33.8 ping in Da'an on the 3rd floor of a 12-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator. Only living room photos are shown—no kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom views, which is a minor red flag for a listing at NT$99,000/month."}
