Features contemporary wood flooring, recessed lighting, sleek white kitchen with black countertops, large floor-to-ceiling windows with abundant greenery views providing excellent natural light. The open-plan living area has a sofa, dining table, TV unit, and modern kitchen—clean and in great condition. For baby safety, the large sliding glass doors/windows on the balcony side would need child locks, and the coffee table has sharp corners that may need padding; the low TV stand cabinets are accessible to crawling babies. At ~20 ping this is a compact but nicely designed space for a couple with a baby."}
