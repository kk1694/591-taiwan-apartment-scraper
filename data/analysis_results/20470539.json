{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with clean white finishes, marble accents, and contemporary wood-tone furniture. Good natural light from large windows with floor-to-ceiling glass. For baby safety: the floor-to-ceiling windows/balcony doors may need child locks, rounded coffee table is a plus, but the small kitchenette has accessible low cabinets. Overall very clean and well-maintained, suitable for a young family on a high floor (14F/15F strongly suggests elevator building)."}
