{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, light wood-look flooring, and modern furnishings including sectional sofa, AC units in multiple rooms, and a dining area visible in the background. The apartment appears to have at least 2-3 bedrooms at 19.42 ping, offering decent space for a family. The glass coffee table with metal frame has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing; the floors are smooth and easy to clean which is good for a baby. At 3F with no elevator (5-floor walkup building), carrying a stroller and baby up stairs daily would be a significant inconvenience. Natural light appears limited based on the small curtained windows, but the staged decor and clean condition suggest a well-maintained unit."}
