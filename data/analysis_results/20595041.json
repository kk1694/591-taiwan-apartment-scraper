{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinhai Road Section 5, Wenshan District, near Wanfang Hospital MRT Station", "notes": "Newly renovated 3BR/2LR/1BA apartment with good natural light and a balcony. Pet-friendly with cooking allowed (natural gas). Has elevator, A/C, fridge, washer, and furniture included. For a couple with a baby: the balcony railing safety should be inspected in person; being on 3F/5F with an elevator is convenient for strollers. Only 1 bathroom for a 30-ping unit is slightly limited. The listing is from an agent (UR House Realty) so expect a service fee. Very close to Wanfang Hospital MRT (372m) which is excellent for prenatal/postnatal hospital access. No management fee but also possibly no building security. Minimum 1-year lease with 2-month deposit."}
