{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Spacious 39-ping apartment with hardwood floors, recessed lighting with cove LED strips, and multiple rooms including at least two bedrooms. The furniture and finishes are dated (traditional dark wood bed frames, older-style sofas, marble coffee table) suggesting a renovation from 10-15 years ago rather than modern. For baby safety, the sharp marble coffee table corners are a concern, and the last bedroom has a sloped ceiling suggesting a top-floor attic layout (7F/7F); windows have security grilles which are good for child safety. Natural light appears moderate with windows in living room and bedrooms, though some rooms seem to rely more on artificial lighting. The listing description is essentially empty (just a sales promotion for the agent platform), which is a red flag — very little information about the actual unit."}
