{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "This listing appears to be a real estate agent advertisement rather than a genuine rental listing. The description only contains a promotional message about agent packages starting from NT$240, with no actual property details, photos, or layout information provided. The price of NT$79,900/month for 49.19 ping in Nangang on the 5th floor of a 15-story building suggests a larger apartment, but without images or a real description, no assessment can be made regarding modernity, baby safety, or living conditions. This listing should be skipped as it lacks substantive information."}
