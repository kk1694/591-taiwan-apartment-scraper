{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new modern studio apartment with high-quality finishes including wood-look flooring, built-in kitchen with microwave, glass shower enclosure, and digital door lock. The space appears very clean but is quite compact for a family; the small balcony has proper railings but glass doors near the balcony could be a concern for a toddler. Good natural light from kitchen window, recessed AC, and overall excellent condition with no visible red flags."}
