{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment with high-end finishes, built-in LED lighting, smart TV, modern kitchen with induction cooktop and built-in oven/microwave, central AC, and quality mattress. Glass coffee table with sharp corners is a baby safety concern. Balcony visible with sliding doors - railings should be verified. Being on 8F of a 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Space is clean and well-designed but compact as a studio."}
