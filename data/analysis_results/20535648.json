{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, both split and concealed AC, and light wood finishes throughout. The spacious living area includes a massage chair and L-shaped sofa, while two bedrooms feature built-in wardrobes, vanity desks, and ample natural light from large windows with security grilles. Being on 4F/4F (top floor of a walk-up with no elevator), carrying a stroller and baby up four flights is a significant concern; the top-floor position also raises potential roof leaking and heat issues, though windows appear to have bars which add child safety."}
