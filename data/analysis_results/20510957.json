{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with stylish finishes including black-framed glass partitions, wood-grain flooring, and contemporary kitchen with stainless steel appliances. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety: the glass partition doors extend to floor level which may need child-proofing, and the open kitchen layout requires baby gates. Clean condition with no obvious red flags; being on 5F of a 19-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
