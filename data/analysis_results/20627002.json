{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained modern apartment with high-end built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, wood laminate flooring, marble accent flooring in hallway, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light with mountain/greenery views. At 48 ping on 3F of an 11F building, it very likely has an elevator. For baby safety, the polished floors may be slippery, and the large sliding glass doors to the balcony area would need child-proofing; the open shelving units have sharp corners at child height that should be padded. The listing description is minimal (just a broker advertisement), which is a minor red flag — more details about layout, rooms, and amenities should be confirmed directly."}
