{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a renovated 1F unit with modern LED lighting and new AC, but includes a concerning basement/storage area with very low ceilings and minimal windows. The outdoor patio area is nicely decorated but the space seems more like a converted commercial/studio space than a traditional apartment. For baby safety, the large glass sliding doors need childproofing and the basement area would be unsuitable for a child. Natural light is limited to the patio-facing rooms."}
