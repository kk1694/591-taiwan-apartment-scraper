{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). The unit features a stylish living room with sofa, coffee table, dining area, open kitchen with built-in appliances, large flat-screen TV, glass-enclosed bathroom, and a separate bedroom with large window and built-in wardrobe. The flat layout with no stairs is baby-safe, though the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding; the window bay seat area has no visible railing concerns. Good natural light from large windows with blinds, and the unit is very clean. Being on the 11th floor of a 13-floor building strongly suggests elevator access."}
