{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern loft-style studio with high ceilings, contemporary fixtures, built-in kitchen with microwave and induction cooktop, and stylish track lighting. Major baby safety concern: there is a steep metal ladder leading to an open loft area with only a glass railing, which is dangerous for young children. The space is clean with good natural light from balcony windows, but the compact open-plan layout and loft design make it challenging for a family with a baby."}
