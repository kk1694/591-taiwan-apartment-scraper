{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin, near hillside/mountainous area", "notes": "Very spacious older apartment (54 ping) with hardwood floors, dated fixtures and crystal chandeliers suggesting 1990s-2000s era construction. The unit is mostly unfurnished with an open floor plan and decent natural light from balcony sliding doors. Major baby safety concerns: the large rooftop terrace has only low concrete walls without proper railings, and the ground-level covered area has exterior stairs with metal railings but uneven stone flooring. The building appears to be a low-rise hillside residence (4F/5F) with no elevator, which would be challenging with a stroller. The description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag for transparency."}
