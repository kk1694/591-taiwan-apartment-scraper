{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "The listing description only contains a promotional message for real estate agent packages and lacks any meaningful property details, photos, or layout information. With no images or substantive description available, it is impossible to assess modernity, elevator access, baby safety concerns, or living conditions. The price of NT$98,000/month for 16.38 ping in Da'an on the 1st floor of a 5-story building suggests a decent-sized unit in a premium district, but the lack of details is a red flag — prospective tenants should request photos and an in-person viewing before considering this listing."}
