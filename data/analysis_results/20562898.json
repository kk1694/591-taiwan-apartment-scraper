{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with clean white built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting with cove ceiling, light wood laminate flooring, and split AC. The space appears empty/unfurnished with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: no visible stairs or dangerous balconies, rounded cabinet edges, but exposed electrical cables on walls would need to be secured before a crawling baby."}
