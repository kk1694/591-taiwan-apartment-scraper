{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Upscale, spacious apartment (63 ping) in excellent condition with high-end finishes including marble-look flooring, recessed ceiling lighting, granite kitchen countertops, and an open-plan kitchen with island. Very clean and well-maintained, managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). The large windows provide good natural light; balcony railings visible in image 3 appear to have decorative ironwork with small gaps that may need baby-proofing. The polished tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby, and the stone kitchen island has sharp corners that would need edge guards."}
