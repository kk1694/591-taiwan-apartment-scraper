{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Beitou hillside with city view", "notes": "This is a multi-story townhouse/villa with interior stairs, not a flat apartment. Modern renovation with recessed lighting, polished tile floors, and clean white walls. Major baby safety concern: open staircase with metal railings will require gates. The hillside location offers excellent views but may be inconvenient for daily errands. Very clean, unfurnished condition with good natural light from large windows."}
