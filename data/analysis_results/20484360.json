{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "This is an older, dated apartment with worn fixtures throughout. The kitchen has aged pink cabinets with a basic gas stove and exposed pipes; the bathroom has stained white tiles and an old squat-style toilet which is not baby-friendly. The bedroom is small with a single bed, basic fabric wardrobe, and limited natural light through barred windows. For a couple expecting a baby, concerns include the narrow kitchen layout, the squat toilet (difficult during pregnancy), the generally worn and slightly grimy condition of surfaces, and the balcony area with a gas water heater and metal grating. Being on the 1st floor limits natural light but avoids stair concerns; overall the apartment feels quite dated and would need significant cleaning and updates to be comfortable for a young family."}
