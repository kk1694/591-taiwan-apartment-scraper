{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style Taiwanese apartment with dated wooden cabinetry, tile floors, and window-mounted AC units throughout. The unit is clean and well-maintained with a spacious living/dining area, but the furnishings and fixtures are from the 1990s-2000s era. The glass-top coffee table has sharp corners that would be a baby safety concern, and the balcony visible through the living room window has a decorative railing pattern that a toddler could potentially climb; the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag for transparency."}
