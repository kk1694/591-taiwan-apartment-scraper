{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older, dated apartment with green marble-style flooring and wood beam accents from perhaps the 1980s-90s. The space is very large but cluttered with old furniture and belongings. For baby safety, the smooth hard floors could be slippery, there's an outdoor covered area with scooter parking that would need securing, and the overall condition shows wear requiring updates. Natural light appears limited through small barred windows."}
