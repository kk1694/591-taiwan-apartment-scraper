{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained living room with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed LED ceiling lighting, large leather sectional sofa, polished tile floors, central air conditioning, and sliding glass partition doors leading to additional rooms. The apartment appears very clean and in good condition. For baby safety, the sharp-cornered glass coffee table and hard tile floors are concerns; the sliding glass doors should have locks. Only the living room is shown across all four photos—no kitchen, bedrooms, or bathrooms are visible, which is a red flag as important areas are hidden. The description is essentially empty (just an ad for the agent's service package), providing no useful details about the apartment itself."}
