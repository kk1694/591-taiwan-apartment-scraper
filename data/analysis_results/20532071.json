{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious duplex apartment with high-end modern finishes, marble accents, recessed lighting, and a well-equipped kitchen with induction cooktop. Major baby safety concern: the internal staircase has open risers and only glass railings, which could be dangerous for a crawling baby or toddler. Good natural light from multiple windows, overall very clean and well-maintained."}
