{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with white glossy tile floors, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture. The open-plan layout has large windows providing good natural light. For baby safety: the glass-top coffee table has sharp corners, there's a visible balcony that would need childproofing, and the hard tile floors may need rugs. The unit appears well-maintained with a washing machine and kitchenette included."}
