{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment in a newer high-rise building with recessed lighting, split AC, sleek kitchenette with induction cooktop, and clean minimalist finishes. The building has a well-equipped gym with city views, strongly indicating elevator access. For a couple expecting a baby, the main concerns are that this is an open-plan studio with no separate bedroom, the bed is right next to a balcony with floor-to-ceiling glass doors (balcony railing safety should be verified in person), and 14.44 ping may feel tight once baby gear is added. Good natural light from the balcony side and the unit appears very clean."}
