{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with bright white tile floors, recessed LED lighting, split AC units in each room, and a well-equipped galley kitchen with gas stove and modern cabinetry. The spacious 59.7 ping layout on the 10th floor of a 13-story building (very likely has elevator) offers good natural light through large windows. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from play mats, and the balcony access doors visible in the living room should be secured; no stairs visible which is a plus for a single-floor layout."}
