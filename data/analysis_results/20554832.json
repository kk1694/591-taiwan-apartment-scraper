{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment with modern furnishings, polished tile floors, and good natural light through large windows with balcony access. Clean condition with split AC units and contemporary decor. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, and the balcony sliding door needs child locks; overall the open floor plan is good but the hard tile flooring may need area rugs for a crawling baby."}
