{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with new marble-pattern tile flooring, recessed LED lighting, modern glass-enclosed bathroom with Panasonic ceiling heater/ventilator, and split/window AC units. The unit is very clean and mostly unfurnished, providing a blank canvas. For baby safety, the polished tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling/toddling baby; the balcony has tile mosaic railings visible through the living room sliding doors which should be checked for gap spacing. Natural light is moderate from windows in the living room and bedrooms, though some bedroom windows face neighboring buildings closely."}
