{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment in a luxury building with rooftop pool. Interior is brand new with recessed lighting, built-in kitchen with microwave and fridge, sleek cabinetry, and clean minimalist design. The bedroom is small but well-furnished with a desk area. For baby safety, the flat open-plan layout is good with no stairs, but the rooftop pool area is a concern; the bedroom is tight and may not fit a crib alongside the bed. Being on the 9th floor of a 13-floor building confirms elevator access. The listing description is minimal (agent-posted), so details on layout and exact room count are unclear — at ~20 ping this may only be a 1-bedroom which could feel cramped for a couple with a baby."}
