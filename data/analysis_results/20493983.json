{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with European-style decor, clean tile floors, and good natural light from large windows. The glass coffee table has sharp edges requiring baby-proofing, but overall the open layout with no visible stairs or dangerous balconies makes it relatively baby-safe. The unit is on floor 8 of a 15-story building, strongly indicating elevator access; air conditioning units are modern."}
