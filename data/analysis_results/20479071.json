{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with sleek minimalist design featuring recessed LED lighting, large floor-to-ceiling windows, and contemporary track lighting. The spacious open-plan living area has tile flooring while bedrooms have warm wood flooring with low platform beds. For baby safety, the raised bed platforms have edges to consider, and the floor-to-ceiling windows/balcony doors would need childproofing; the unit appears clean with good natural light from multiple large windows."}
