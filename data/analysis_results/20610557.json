{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Modern duplex loft apartment on 15F/16F with sleek finishes, recessed lighting, glass staircase railings, and a well-equipped kitchen with gas stove. Major baby safety concern: the internal staircase has glass panel railings with open gaps at each step that a toddler could slip through or fall from, and the glass coffee table has sharp edges. The unit has excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access, the space is clean and well-maintained, but the duplex layout with steep stairs makes it less ideal for a family with a young child."}
