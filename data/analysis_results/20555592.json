{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a very modern, spacious apartment with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, split AC units, and a fully equipped contemporary kitchen with built-in appliances. The unit appears clean and recently renovated. Baby safety considerations: the balcony has horizontal bar railings that a child could climb, and the highly polished floors may be slippery. Excellent natural light through large sliding glass doors. Overall a high-quality, well-maintained residence."}
