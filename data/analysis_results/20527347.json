{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with basic renovation — clean white tile floors and white walls, but dated fixtures and minimal furnishing (small sofa, wall-mounted shelves, window AC units). The rooms are separated by mirrored glass folding doors which could be a pinch hazard for a baby. The windows appear to have low sills with a fold-down shelf/ledge below them, which a toddler could potentially climb; no visible window guards. Decent natural light from windows but the space feels sparse and somewhat worn, with visible wall discoloration near the floor in some areas suggesting possible past moisture issues."}
