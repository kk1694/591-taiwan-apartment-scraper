{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment in a newer building with contemporary fixtures, large tile flooring, modern sliding glass windows, split AC units, and minimalist furniture. The 4F/11F configuration strongly suggests an elevator building. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors in both the living room and bedroom open to what appears to be a small balcony or ledge — these would need child locks; the coffee table has some sharp corners. Good natural light from multiple windows with greenery views, and the flat open floor plan is spacious at ~75 sqm. However, the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — limited info on layout, kitchen, and bathroom."}
