{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and well-maintained apartment with stylish finishes including marble accent walls, recessed LED lighting, and light wood-look flooring. The unit has excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows and appears spacious and clean. For baby safety, the low balcony railings visible in images 4-5 would need attention, and the sharp corners on the marble TV wall and furniture edges are potential concerns; otherwise the flat open floor plan is generally baby-friendly."}
