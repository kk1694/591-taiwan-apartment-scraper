{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Spacious, well-furnished apartment on a high floor (11F/14F) with hardwood flooring throughout, leather sofas, glass dining table with decorative mirrored wall, en-suite bedroom with large windows, and a walk-in closet. The large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light and city views; the balcony has railing-height glass doors which would need child-proofing. The glass coffee table has sharp corners and the bed frame lacks a mattress, suggesting some furnishing gaps. Overall clean and modern condition with good storage, suitable for a family but the balcony access and glass furniture edges are baby safety concerns to address."}
