{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very well-renovated modern apartment with wood-tone flooring, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and a stylish kitchen with gas stove and modern appliances. At least 2 bedrooms visible (one with bed, one empty room suitable as a nursery), plus a living room and dining/kitchen area. For baby safety, note the sliding closet doors which are relatively safe, but there is a visible wall crack in the second bedroom that may indicate structural or moisture issues worth investigating. The balcony visible through curtains in the living room should be checked for railing height. Overall clean, bright, and well-maintained — good for a young family in Xinyi district. Floor 5 of 11 strongly suggests elevator access."}
