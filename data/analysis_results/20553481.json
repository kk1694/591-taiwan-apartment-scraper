{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with clean light wood laminate flooring, modern track lighting, AC units, and white furniture throughout. The space appears clean and well-maintained with a long narrow hallway layout typical of older Datong district buildings. Concern for baby safety: the long narrow corridor could be fine, but no windows are visible in the living area (natural light appears limited, with drop ceiling tiles suggesting a possibly windowless or basement-like feel), and the bedroom window area behind heavy curtains needs checking. At 4F with no elevator confirmed, carrying a stroller up stairs daily would be a significant inconvenience. The entryway sign reads '幸福公寓' (Happiness Apartment)."}
