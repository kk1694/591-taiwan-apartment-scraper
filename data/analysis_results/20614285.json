{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, well-appointed apartment with high-end finishes including marble-look polished floors, built-in central AC, large LG side-by-side refrigerator, built-in oven, decorative mosaic accent walls, and custom cabinetry throughout. The unit is unfurnished with spacious rooms, good for a family; the polished tile floors may be slippery for a crawling baby but no stairs or dangerous balcony railings are visible. The 6F/7F placement in Songshan at 39 ping with luxury finishes justifies the NT$70k price; however, the listing description is extremely sparse (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — verify actual room count and lease terms directly."}
