{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated green marble flooring and basic fixtures from the 1990s-2000s era. The unit is clean and spacious with multiple rooms, air conditioning units, and natural light from balcony windows. For baby safety, the hard marble floors could be a concern for crawling/falling, and the kitchen shows older appliances; no obvious balcony railing hazards visible but the balcony access should be verified. Overall functional but not modern."}
