{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with modern ceiling lights, new laminate flooring, split AC units, glass block windows, sliding door to a modern kitchen with wood-tone cabinetry, and clean white walls. The unit is very clean with no visible sharp corners or hazards; the open floor plan is baby-friendly, though being on 7F/7F (top floor) with no elevator info means stairs could be a concern for carrying a stroller. Natural light is moderate via glass block windows, which limits direct light and views; the description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag suggesting limited listing detail."}
