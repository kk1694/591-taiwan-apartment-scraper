{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, marble accent walls, recessed lighting, and quality furnishings. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety: no visible balcony access in photos, windows appear to have security bars/grilles, furniture has rounded corners. The 14th floor location in a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Clean and move-in ready condition with no red flags."}
