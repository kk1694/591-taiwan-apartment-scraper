{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment in good condition with polished tile floors, L-shaped leather sofa, wall-mounted AC units, and a video intercom system at the front door. The unit has at least two bedrooms with wooden beds and wardrobes, and a spacious living area with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery; no visible balcony hazards in photos, and furniture corners (glass-top dining table, TV cabinet) would need edge guards. The 9-story building on floor 2 very likely has an elevator. The description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — would need to confirm layout details and whether kitchen/bathroom are included."}
