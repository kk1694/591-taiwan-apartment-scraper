{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": "京站花園廣場 (Q Square Garden Plaza), near Taipei Main Station", "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/office space listing, NOT a residential apartment. Images show a building management office with '京站花園廣場' signage, shopping mall corridors with Starbucks and retail shops, and building lobby with elevators - no actual living space shown. The building is modern with nice common areas and elevator access on floor 13. Not suitable as a residential unit for a family with baby."}
