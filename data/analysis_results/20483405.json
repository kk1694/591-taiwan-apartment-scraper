{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) with hardwood floors throughout, modern white kitchen with full appliances, and a clean living area with built-in cabinetry. The 12-story building on the 5th floor almost certainly has an elevator; the unit has large windows providing good natural light, and the rooms appear to have rounded ceiling moldings with no obvious sharp corners, though the dark wood coffee table edges and metal bed frame in the bedroom would need baby-proofing. Large sliding glass doors to what appears to be a balcony area should be checked for child-safe locks and railing height."}
