{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with contemporary fixtures, wood laminate flooring, open-plan living/dining/kitchen layout, and stylish built-in shelving. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light. For baby safety: the raised tatami platform near windows could be a fall hazard, and the glass coffee table and bar stools with metal legs present bump/tip-over risks. Being on 2F of a 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
