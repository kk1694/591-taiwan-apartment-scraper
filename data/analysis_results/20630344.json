{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern, upscale apartment with designer finishes including recessed LED lighting, large flat-screen TV, crystal chandelier, tufted headboard, and glossy tile/hardwood flooring. The unit is on the 9th of 10 floors in what appears to be a newer high-rise building, almost certainly with an elevator. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp edges, the floor-to-ceiling windows near the balcony area need childproofing, and the glass display shelving could be a concern; however, the overall layout is open and spacious with good natural light from large windows. The apartment is clean and well-maintained, listed through Miller House agency, and represents good value for a luxury-finished 23.66 ping unit in Neihu."}
