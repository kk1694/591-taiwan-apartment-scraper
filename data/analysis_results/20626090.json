{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older apartment in need of significant renovation - walls show dirt marks, holes from removed fixtures, and peeling paint. The decorative ceiling panels and dated window AC units are from the 1980s-90s era. While spacious (50 ping), the exposed wiring on floors and walls poses safety concerns for a crawling baby, and the overall dated condition would require substantial cleaning and repairs before move-in."}
