{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed lighting, split AC, and contemporary furnishings. The space appears very clean with good natural light from multiple windows and a balcony with sliding glass doors. For baby safety, the balcony access and sharp-cornered glass coffee table should be addressed, but no major red flags visible. Being on 4F of an 18-floor building strongly suggests elevator access."}
