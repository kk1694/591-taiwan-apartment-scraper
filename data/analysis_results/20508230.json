{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, and contemporary fixtures including glass-enclosed shower. The floor plan shows a master bedroom (4 ping), multi-function room (1.8 ping), living room (8 ping), 2 bathrooms, and a balcony. Good natural light from large windows in the bedroom. For baby safety, the balcony has railings visible in photos, and the glass shower doors in bathrooms would need child locks; the open floor plan with smooth tile is generally baby-friendly but the sharp-edged side tables and low TV stand would need attention. Being on the 7th floor of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
