{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Modern, unfurnished apartment on the top floor (14F/14F) with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, central AC vents, and a wall-mounted AC unit in the bedroom. The unit is spacious at ~150 sqm with large windows providing good natural light and mountain/greenery views. For baby safety, the unit appears to be a single-level flat with no stairs, no visible balcony railings in photos, and smooth floors without sharp edges; however, being the top floor may mean potential heat and leak issues, and the completely empty/unfurnished state means all furniture will need to be sourced. Only 4 photos were provided which limits assessment of kitchen, bathrooms, and balcony areas."}
