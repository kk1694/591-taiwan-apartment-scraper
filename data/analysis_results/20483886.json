{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with a minimalist industrial-chic aesthetic featuring clean white walls, modern light wood flooring, stylish pendant lighting, open wardrobe shelving, a Hitachi fridge, and Heran microwave. The space is very clean with good natural light from large windows; the flat layout with no visible stairs is baby-friendly, though the open metal wardrobe frames and low-profile furniture with sharp edges would need baby-proofing. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — verify actual room count and lease terms directly."}
