{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very well-renovated modern apartment with clean white/beige tones, recessed lighting, split AC units, open-plan kitchen with glass backsplash, and at least two bedrooms with built-in wardrobes. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), suggesting foreigner-friendly. The glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the frosted glass sliding doors between rooms could be a pinch hazard for small children. Overall the unit is spacious at 19 ping, very clean, and in good condition on the 7th floor of an 11-story building which almost certainly has an elevator; natural light appears decent through multiple large windows though they are covered with frosted blinds in the photos."}
