{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with sleek finishes, hardwood flooring, designer lighting, and contemporary furniture. The spacious open-plan living/dining area has good natural light and clean lines. For baby safety, the coffee table has rounded edges which is positive, but the balcony utility area shows horizontal railings that a toddler could potentially climb - would need baby gates. The kitchen is modern with ample counter space but has a gas stove requiring child safety measures."}
