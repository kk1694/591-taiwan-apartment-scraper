{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment with stylish living room featuring crystal chandelier, stone accent walls, and recessed lighting. Major baby safety concern: internal stairs leading to upper loft area with wooden railing that has wide gaps between slats - would require childproofing. The loft has low ceiling height and open railings. Kitchen area appears modern with new refrigerator and access to a small balcony with washing machine. Clean condition overall but limited natural light visible."}
