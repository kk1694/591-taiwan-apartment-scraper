{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment in fair condition with multiple rooms and a balcony. The living room has tile floors, a sofa, and AC but dated fixtures and lighting. Bedrooms are mostly empty with one having a small platform bed and old wooden wardrobe. The bathroom has a freestanding bathtub, glass vanity, and modern toilet but the overall finish looks aging. For baby safety, the balcony door in the living room has low railings that would need child-proofing, and the glass coffee table and glass bathroom vanity present sharp-edge risks. Natural light is limited in some rooms; the listing description is minimal (just a generic agent promo), which is a red flag suggesting sparse details about the property."}
