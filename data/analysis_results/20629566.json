{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Spacious and modern apartment with clean white interior, light wood-tone flooring, recessed lighting, and a large open-plan living/dining area with sliding glass balcony doors providing good natural light. The unit has at least two bedrooms with built-in furniture and desks. For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors and low coffee table edges are potential concerns; a portable AC unit with exposed hose in one room should be secured. The building is 12 floors so very likely has an elevator, and overall condition is clean and well-maintained, though the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — request full details from the Sung-Hsin Real Estate agent."}
