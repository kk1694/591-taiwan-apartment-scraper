{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older top-floor (7F/7F) apartment with an internal staircase leading to what appears to be a rooftop addition, which is a major baby safety concern as the open staircase has wide baluster gaps. The living area has dated tile flooring, faux-brick walls, and older light fixtures; bedrooms have mixed laminate and hardwood flooring with some wear. Natural light is decent from multiple windows, but the description is just an agent advertisement with no real details — this likely a rooftop illegal addition (頂加), which could have heat/leak issues and legal risk."}
