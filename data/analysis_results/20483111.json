{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including white tile flooring, fitted kitchen with gas stove, large fridge, and dish dryer, plus wall-mounted AC units. The living room has large sliding glass doors to a balcony which would need child-proofing; the coffee table has sharp corners that could be a concern for a crawling baby. Good natural light through floor-to-ceiling windows, spacious 31-ping layout with separate dining area, video intercom at the door, and the 8th floor of a 12-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Overall a solid family-friendly option at a reasonable price for this size in Nangang."}
