{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Rongguang Park (榮光公園) and Shipai Elementary School (石牌國民小學), Beitou District", "notes": "Modern high-rise building (14 floors) with an upscale lobby featuring designer furniture, high ceilings, and a library wall — indicates a newer luxury development called 傑創菁英 (Excellent Again). The building exterior is sleek with dark contemporary finishes. No interior apartment photos are provided (only building exterior, nearby park, school, and lobby), so actual unit condition, natural light, and baby safety features like balcony railings or sharp corners cannot be assessed. The nearby park and elementary school are positives for family living, and at 27.63 ping the unit is a decent size for a couple with a baby."}
