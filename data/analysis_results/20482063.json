{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end luxury apartment in a prestigious building with grand lobby and courtyard. The unit features modern finishes with elegant decor, polished tile floors, chandelier lighting, and appears very clean. For baby safety, the balcony has decorative iron railings that a child could potentially climb; the hard tile floors and glass furniture corners could pose risks. Excellent natural light from large balcony windows on the 14th floor with mountain views."}
