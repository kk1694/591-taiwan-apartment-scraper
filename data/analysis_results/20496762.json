{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, bright apartment with minimalist design, white tile floors, and contemporary furniture. Very clean and well-maintained with good natural light. For baby safety: the unit appears to be a loft/duplex with stairs visible in image 2 (significant hazard for crawling baby), coffee table has sharp corners, and the vertical slat room divider could be a climbing hazard. Kitchen is compact but well-equipped with induction cooktop."}
