{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and clean renovated apartment with modern white finishes, built-in TV unit, split AC, full L-shaped kitchen with gas stove and range hood, and a bathroom with bathtub. At 46 ping this is very generous for a family; the open living area has smooth tile floors and no visible sharp corners, though the bathtub area lacks a non-slip mat and would need baby-proofing. Being on 5F/6F with no elevator confirmed is a concern for carrying a stroller and baby; listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) with minimal description suggesting it may be an older building with updated interior."}
