{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/retail storefront space rather than a residential apartment - images show a large open floor plan with drop ceiling, fluorescent lighting, and a street-level entrance with roll-up gate visible with vehicles/motorcycles outside. There are stairs with metal railings suggesting multiple levels. Not suitable for residential use with a baby due to commercial nature, lack of proper rooms, and unsafe staircase railings with wide gaps a child could fall through."}
