{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed lighting, dark marble-look tile flooring in the living area and wood-look flooring in the bedrooms. The unit is unfurnished and very clean with multiple rooms visible (at least 3 bedrooms plus living area), making it spacious at 44 ping. For baby safety, the dark tile flooring in the living room is hard and slippery which could be a concern for a crawling baby; however, all windows have proper frames and no exposed balconies are visible. Natural light is decent through multiple windows in each room. Listed through UR House (foreigner-friendly agency) which is a plus, but the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), so details on layout, kitchen, and bathroom are unknown — an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
