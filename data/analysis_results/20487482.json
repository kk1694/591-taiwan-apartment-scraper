{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated tile floors and older-style window AC units. The space is clean and empty but has limited natural light due to small horizontal windows positioned high on the walls. For baby safety, the flat single-level layout is good, but exposed electrical cables on the floor and lack of visible safety features are concerns to address before move-in."}
