{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including track lighting, polished tile floors, and updated kitchen with breakfast bar. The glass dining table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the coffee table also has hard edges. Good natural light with large windows in bedroom and living areas. Clean condition overall with air conditioning units visible. No obvious safety hazards like open balconies visible, but the glass coffee table could be a concern for a crawling baby."}
