{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious, modern high-rise apartment with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows and mountain views. The open-plan layout with tile flooring is very clean and well-maintained; built-in cabinetry and recessed lighting throughout. For baby safety, the balcony has glass railings which may need additional barriers, and the coffee table has some sharp corners, but overall the open space is relatively safe with no stairs visible."}
