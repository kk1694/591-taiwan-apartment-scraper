{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern loft-style studio with high ceilings, contemporary finishes, built-in kitchen with induction cooktop and washer/dryer. Major baby safety concern: there is an open loft area with a steep metal ladder and no guardrails visible on the upper level - this would be dangerous for a crawling baby/toddler. The space is clean and well-lit with recessed lighting but limited natural light visible. Very compact layout typical of a studio."}
