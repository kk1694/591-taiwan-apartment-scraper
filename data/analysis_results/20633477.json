{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, newly renovated apartment with modern fixtures including a wall-mounted TV, new washer/dryer, large refrigerator, robot vacuum, and recessed lighting. Good natural light from large windows. The open layout with rounded furniture edges and spacious living area is relatively baby-friendly, though the glass coffee table could be a concern for a crawling baby."}
