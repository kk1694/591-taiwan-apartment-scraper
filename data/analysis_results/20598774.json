{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including marble-look TV wall, LED accent lighting, wood-tone laminate flooring, and stylish light fixtures. Kitchen is well-equipped with washing machine, induction cooktop, and ample cabinetry. Major baby safety concern: the unit has an internal staircase (likely a loft/mezzanine layout) with no visible railing or baby gate, which is a significant hazard for a crawling infant. The stairs with built-in storage drawers also have sharp edges. The living area appears clean and bright, but the small 2-person dining table and narrow kitchen suggest the space may feel tight for a growing family despite the 24 ping listing size."}
