{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, split AC units, built-in cabinetry, and contemporary wood-textured panels. The balcony has proper metal railings with narrow spacing which is reasonably baby-safe, though the sliding door access should be secured. Clean condition with good natural light from large windows. The hard tile and laminate floors are easy to clean but would need area rugs for a crawling baby."}
