{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently repainted apartment with grey walls and decorative molding, but uses older window-type AC units and the unit is completely unfurnished with no kitchen or bathroom visible. The balcony has sliding glass doors with what appears to be adequate railings, though the balcony area looks small and cluttered. For a couple expecting a baby, the lack of furniture and old AC units are drawbacks, and at 4F with no elevator confirmed this could be inconvenient with a stroller; the flat open floor plan is a plus for baby safety but the listing description is suspiciously minimal (just an agent ad), suggesting this may be a low-effort broker listing."}
