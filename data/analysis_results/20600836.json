{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed LED lighting, built-in wood-panel cabinetry, split AC, and clean tile floors throughout. Listed by Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), the living room is spacious with an L-shaped sofa, and there is a bedroom plus a smaller study/second room that could serve as a nursery. The floors are smooth tile with no visible stairs or sharp edges, and the 7th floor of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access; the main baby safety concern would be the balcony area visible in the living room photos, which should be checked for secure railings."}
