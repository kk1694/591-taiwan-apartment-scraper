{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Exceptionally modern studio with high-end finishes including built-in oven, wine cooler, induction cooktop, and LED strip lighting throughout. Very clean and bright with glass shower enclosure and washing machine included. For baby safety, the glass shower door and low platform bed are considerations, but overall the minimalist design has few sharp corners; the space is quite compact at 11 ping which may feel cramped with a growing family."}
