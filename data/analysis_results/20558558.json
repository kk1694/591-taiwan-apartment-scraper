{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern renovation with recessed lighting, large marble-look floor tiles, built-in TV cabinet, and central AC — the unit appears newly finished and very clean. The building has an elevator (shown in lobby photo) and upscale common areas including a lounge and library/meeting room, indicating a well-managed modern community. For baby safety, the flat tile floors are easy to clean but slippery; the living room is spacious with minimal sharp corners, though only 2 interior photos were provided so kitchen, bathroom, and bedrooms could not be assessed — the sparse listing description is a minor red flag worth investigating."}
