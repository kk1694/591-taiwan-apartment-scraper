{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with excellent finishes, crystal chandelier, marble TV wall accent, and open-plan living. Very clean with abundant natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Baby safety concerns include the balcony with glass railings and coffee table with sharp edges; being on 7F/7F (top floor) with no visible elevator info is a consideration for stroller access."}
