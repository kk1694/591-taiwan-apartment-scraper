{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Highly modern apartment with sleek minimalist design, recessed lighting, marble TV console, and contemporary furnishings. The unit appears very clean with good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety concerns: the glass partition between bedroom and living area has low metal framing that a crawling baby could push against, and there appears to be an internal staircase visible in image 1 which would need gating; otherwise furniture has rounded edges and the space is open and safe."}
