{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern loft-style studio apartment with contemporary fixtures, clean white/grey aesthetic, AC, and modern kitchen. MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN: metal ladder to loft/mezzanine area is dangerous for small children and would require blocking. The space is compact but well-designed with good lighting; rounded furniture edges are a plus but the open kitchen layout and ladder present hazards for a crawling baby."}
