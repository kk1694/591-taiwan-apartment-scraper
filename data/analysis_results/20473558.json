{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with reddish hardwood floors, textured ceiling tiles, and a very large open kitchen with ample counter space and full-size refrigerator. The unit is clean and well-maintained but has dated finishes from the 1990s-2000s era. For baby safety, the open kitchen layout with sharp counter corners and the step-up between tiled kitchen and wood-floored living area are concerns; natural light appears limited with small windows, and being on the 2F without confirmed elevator access could be inconvenient with a stroller."}
