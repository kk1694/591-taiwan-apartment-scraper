{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinhai Road Section 1, Da'an District, near Taipei Electric Building MRT (Roman Roland Art Plaza Mansion)", "notes": "Large 3BR/2BA unit on 10F of a 27-story building with 24hr security, elevator, and full furnishings including appliances. Building is ~35 years old so fixtures may be dated despite amenities. Baby safety considerations: 2 balconies need railing inspection, older building may have sharp-cornered fixtures; the high floor and 24hr security are positives. Cooking allowed and natural gas available, which is good for a family, but no interior photos available to confirm modern condition or natural light levels."}
