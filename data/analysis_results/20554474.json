{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Spacious apartment (51.8 ping) with traditional-style wooden furniture that feels dated rather than modern. The unit is clean with tile flooring, a decent-sized living room, at least two bedrooms, and a bathroom with bathtub. Baby safety concerns include the open balcony with metal railings visible in the master bedroom (3rd floor), sharp corners on the heavy wooden furniture, and the bathtub area which would need supervision. Good natural light from large windows and balcony doors, with pleasant green hillside views from the balcony. The listing description is minimal (agent promotional text only), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and amenities."}
