{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and clean apartment with modern fixtures including central AC, built-in wardrobes, and a unique glass-enclosed bathroom with bathtub in the master bedroom. The open layout with tile floors is easy to clean but may be slippery for a crawling baby. The balcony with floor-to-ceiling windows has adequate railings, though baby-proofing would be needed. Good natural light from large windows."}
