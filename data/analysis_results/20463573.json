{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in very clean condition with high-end finishes including recessed lighting, designer pendant lights, modern furniture, and dark hardwood floors in bedrooms. At least 3 bedrooms visible with a spacious open-plan living/dining area; the 13-floor building on the 5th floor almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the living room has a balcony with metal railings visible in image 2 that would need childproofing, and the floor-to-ceiling windows in bedrooms have low sills that should be secured; furniture corners on the coffee table and dining table are relatively rounded. Good natural light from large windows in all rooms. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — verify layout and amenities directly with the agent (Ms. Huang 0918055898)."}
