{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Well-maintained but dated luxury-style apartment with dark hardwood floors, recessed ceiling lighting, and wood-panel built-in wardrobes — the decor feels mid-2000s rather than modern. The living room is spacious with a TV unit and coffee table, and the bedroom has large windows providing decent natural light, though views face neighboring buildings closely. For baby safety, the hardwood floors have sharp edges at joins and the coffee table has glass/sharp corners; the windows appear to have security bars which is good, but no photos of kitchen, bathroom, or balcony were provided — request additional images to assess full safety."}
