{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious unfurnished apartment (84 ping) with polished marble floors, recessed lighting, central AC vents, wall-mounted split AC units, and a well-equipped kitchen with large refrigerator and granite countertops. Excellent natural light from large windows on multiple sides. The marble floors are extremely slippery which is a significant baby safety concern, and the open kitchen with glass partition would need baby-proofing; the unit is on 3F of a 14-floor building likely with elevator. Very clean and well-maintained but completely empty — would need all furniture."}
