{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex-style apartment in Zhongshan with clean white finishes, recessed lighting, induction cooktop, and modern cabinetry. The unit has internal stairs connecting two levels which is a significant baby safety concern — the staircase is narrow with no visible baby gate and the railing has wide gaps that a small child could fit through. The upper level has a sloped ceiling under the staircase suggesting a loft/mezzanine layout. The space appears clean and well-maintained with a balcony off the kitchen area, but the description is minimal (agent listing placeholder) providing no useful details about the property."}
