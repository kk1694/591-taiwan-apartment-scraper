{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Luxury modern apartment on the top floor (10F) with high-end finishes including marble countertops, designer pendant lighting, glass sliding partitions, and sleek built-in cabinetry. The open-plan kitchen has a large island with bar seating but no enclosed cooking area, which may be limiting. For baby safety: the large floor-to-ceiling glass panels and open kitchen island with sharp marble edges are concerns; the high bar stools are a tipping hazard for toddlers. Good natural light from multiple large windows with city views; the unit is very clean and move-in ready, though the description is essentially empty (just an agent promotion), which is a minor red flag — confirm actual layout and room count directly."}
