{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern and stylish apartment with wood-tone paneling, recessed lighting, white brick accent wall, black-framed glass partition doors, and quality wood-look flooring. The space appears clean and well-maintained with a contemporary design aesthetic. At 6F/13F the building very likely has an elevator. Glass partition doors between rooms could be a concern for baby safety (breakage risk), and the raised platform/step visible near the bedroom area is a tripping hazard for toddlers. Overall a high-quality, well-lit unit suitable for a couple, though some baby-proofing of glass doors and edges would be needed."}
