{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "This is a 39.6 ping (130.7 sqm) apartment on the 9th floor of a 15-story building in Nangang District, priced at NT$65,000/month. The listing description is minimal, containing only a promotional message for real estate agents rather than actual property details, making it impossible to assess condition, fixtures, or baby safety features. The mid-rise floor position in a 15-story building suggests it likely has an elevator, but this cannot be confirmed from the available information."}
