{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white tile floors, contemporary furniture, and updated fixtures including split AC. The living room has a balcony with sturdy metal railings visible through glass sliding doors, which is reasonably baby-safe. The glass coffee table with sharp corners is a concern for a crawling baby, and the standing mirror in the bedroom could tip over. Good natural light in living area, bedrooms have blackout curtains."}
