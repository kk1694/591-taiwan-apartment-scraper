{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, wood-look laminate flooring, and clean white walls. Spacious living area with L-shaped sofa, separate dining area, and at least two bedrooms. The glass coffee table has sharp corners and the bedroom windows have traditional iron grilles which are good for safety but the balcony/window areas would need childproofing. No kitchen or bathroom photos are shown, which is a notable omission; the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent advertisement), so details about amenities, lease terms, and actual room count are unclear — confirm these before visiting."}
