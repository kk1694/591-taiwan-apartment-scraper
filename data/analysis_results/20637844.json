{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "三陽家園", "notes": "Interior is well-renovated with modern fixtures including recessed lighting, split AC, and contemporary TV cabinet. Clean tiled floors are good for baby safety. Building exterior is an older 5-story walk-up from the 1980s-90s with typical Taiwan balcony grilles; being on 1F means no elevator concerns but ground floor may have humidity/security considerations. No stairs visible inside the unit which is positive for a family with a baby."}
