{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment with dated interior featuring ornate ceiling details, crystal chandelier, and older-style wallpaper. The marble floors and large open living area are clean but the decor feels 1990s-era. For baby safety, the hard marble floors could be concerning for falls, and the balcony visible through sliding doors would need safety assessment. Good natural light from multiple windows."}
