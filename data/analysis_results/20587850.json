{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and modern high-floor apartment in Beitou with hardwood flooring, recessed ceiling lighting, open-plan living area with L-shaped sofa, dining set, wall-mounted TV, and a kitchen with fridge and microwave. The unit is very clean and in excellent condition with large floor-to-ceiling windows providing abundant natural light. Being on the 11th floor of an 11-story building, the balcony with glass sliding doors is a concern for baby safety and would need secure locks; the glass coffee table has sharp edges that should be baby-proofed, but overall the flat layout with no stairs is ideal for a family with a young child."}
