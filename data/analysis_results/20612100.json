{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with high-quality custom built-in cabinetry, curved TV feature wall, recessed lighting, ceiling-mounted AC, and light wood laminate flooring throughout. The space is clean, well-maintained, and stylishly furnished with a dining area and living room. For baby safety: the balcony has a diamond-pattern security grille which is good, but the open cube shelving unit and low coffee table with metal legs could pose bumping hazards; the glass sliding doors between rooms may need childproofing. Natural light appears moderate, mainly from the balcony side. Being on 3F of a 5-story walkup with no visible elevator, carrying a stroller up stairs daily would be a concern."}
