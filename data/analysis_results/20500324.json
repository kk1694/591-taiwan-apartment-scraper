{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xingcheng Street (興城街), Datong District, 373m from Shuanglian MRT Station", "notes": "This is a spacious 3BR/2BA whole-floor residential unit on the 10th floor of a 15-story elevator building with security guard management. The unit is fully furnished with appliances and has two balconies — the balconies should be inspected for railing safety and gaps before a baby arrives. Good location near two MRT stations (Shuanglian and Minquan West Road), but the description is minimal (appears to be a broker listing template), and no photos could be verified to confirm modern condition or cleanliness, so an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
