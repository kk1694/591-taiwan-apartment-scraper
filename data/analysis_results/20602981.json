{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed lighting, built-in cabinets, and high-quality tile flooring. Good natural light from windows with mountain views. For baby safety: no visible balcony but coffee table has sharp glass edges and the cube shelving has open corners at child height that may need padding; overall a clean, well-maintained space suitable for a family."}
