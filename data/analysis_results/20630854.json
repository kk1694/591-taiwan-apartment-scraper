{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, recently renovated studio apartment with modern fixtures including new kitchen cabinets, stainless steel refrigerator, wall-mounted TV, and AC. The space is well-lit with multiple windows and light-colored laminate flooring. For baby safety, the windows have security bars which is good, but there appears to be a small balcony/laundry area that would need baby-proofing. Furniture has some sharp corners on the coffee table and wooden cabinet. No bathroom shown in photos."}
