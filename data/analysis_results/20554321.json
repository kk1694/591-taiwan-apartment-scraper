{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with light wood laminate flooring, updated open kitchen with stainless steel fridge, and clean white walls throughout. The living room has good natural light with floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a balcony. Two bedrooms with frosted glass sliding closet doors; the glass coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony glass doors should be checked for secure child locks. At 31 ping on the 4th floor of a 7-story building without confirmed elevator, carrying a stroller up stairs could be a concern worth verifying."}
