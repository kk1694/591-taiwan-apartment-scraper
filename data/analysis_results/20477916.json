{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Very modern, high-quality apartment on the 11th floor with excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows in multiple rooms. The unit features contemporary wood-tone finishes, built-in wardrobes, a wall-mounted TV, split AC units, a modern bathroom with bathtub and bidet toilet, and a tatami-style raised platform room. For baby safety, the large windows appear to be fixed or sliding with no balcony visible, which is positive; however, the raised tatami platform and the glass partition near the living area could pose minor hazards for a crawling baby. Managed by UR House (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), which is a good sign for a foreign couple; the unit is very clean and in excellent move-in condition at 37 ping, offering generous space for a growing family."}
