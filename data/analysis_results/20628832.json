{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including light wood laminate flooring, recessed LED lighting, and split-type air conditioning units throughout. The space appears very clean and well-maintained with multiple rooms. For baby safety, the windows appear to have secure bars/grilles and there are no visible stairs or dangerous railings; corners are standard but would benefit from edge protectors. Natural light is moderate with several windows, though some rooms face the light well/airshaft."}
