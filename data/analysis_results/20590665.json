{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment with luxurious finishes including crystal chandeliers, polished marble-look tile floors, and built-in cabinetry throughout. The spacious living/dining area has large windows providing decent natural light, and the master bedroom includes an en-suite bathroom with glass shower enclosure and built-in wardrobe with sliding doors. For baby safety, the slippery polished tile floors are a concern, the living room has a balcony with floor-to-ceiling windows that should be checked for secure locks, and the glass sliding bathroom doors and sharp-cornered furniture (coffee table, dining table) would need childproofing."}
