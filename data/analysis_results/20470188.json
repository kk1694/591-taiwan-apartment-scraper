{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious upscale apartment with European classical-style decor including ornate furniture, crystal chandeliers, and dark wood flooring in bedrooms. The unit is very clean and well-maintained at 41.2 ping, with large windows providing decent natural light. The glass-top coffee table with sharp ornate legs, wrought-iron decorative partition, and hard tile flooring in the living area are baby safety concerns; the 5th floor without confirmed elevator could also be challenging with a stroller. Listed by 柏林不動產 (Berlin Real Estate) agency — the description is essentially empty (just an ad for their services), which is a minor red flag."}
