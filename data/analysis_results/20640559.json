{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained modern apartment with recessed LED lighting, wall-mounted AC, wood-accent feature wall, and hardwood flooring in bedrooms. At least two large bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and a generous living room. The balcony has metal railings with relatively wide gaps that could be a safety concern for a baby/toddler and would need childproofing; the balcony is on the 4th floor overlooking greenery. Overall very clean, good natural light through large sliding glass doors, and plenty of room for a growing family. The glass coffee table with sharp corners in the living room would also need baby-proofing."}
