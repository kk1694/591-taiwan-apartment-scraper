{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylishly renovated open-plan apartment with modern fixtures, designer furniture, and updated kitchen with gas stove and range hood. The large open layout with minimal barriers and glass partitions is suitable for a family, though sharp-cornered furniture like the glass coffee table would need baby-proofing. Good natural light from multiple windows, very clean condition overall."}
