{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "The apartment is functional but dated with older window AC units and somewhat worn wooden flooring. It has a raised platform area near the entrance which poses a fall hazard for crawling babies or toddlers. Natural light appears limited due to small windows with security bars; being on the 1st floor of a 16-story building likely means an elevator exists but ground floor units often have less light and privacy."}
