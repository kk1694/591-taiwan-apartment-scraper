{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including wooden TV cabinet, old-style tiled floors, and a window-unit AC in the bedroom. The kitchen is spacious with a large refrigerator and dining area but has older cabinetry. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard and slippery, and the living room has glass-fronted cabinets and sharp-edged furniture; the kitchen has open trash bins and accessible low cabinets. Natural light is moderate — the kitchen has large windows with blinds, the bedroom has a window with greenery outside, but the living room appears to rely mostly on artificial light. At 27 ping and 5F with no elevator evidence, carrying a stroller up five flights would be a significant concern."}
