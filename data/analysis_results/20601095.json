{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "This is a 33.21 ping (109.6 sqm) apartment on the 7th floor of a 7-floor building in Da'an District at NT$50,000/month. The listing description only contains a promotional message for real estate agents and lacks any meaningful property details, photos, or layout information. Being on the top floor (7F/7F) raises concerns about potential roof leaks and summer heat; the lack of description and images makes it impossible to assess modernity, elevator access, baby safety features, or overall condition — further investigation is strongly recommended before visiting."}
