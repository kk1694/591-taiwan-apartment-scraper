{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment in good condition with recessed ceiling lighting, clean white tile floors, AC units, and solid wood furniture throughout. At 3F/14F in a 14-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the tile floors are slippery, the rustic wooden furniture has rough edges and sharp corners that would need padding, and the sliding glass balcony doors in the living room should be child-locked; however the windows appear to have secure frames. The description is minimal (just an agent promo), offering no details about the unit itself, which is a minor red flag — verify layout, lease terms, and whether the heavy wooden furniture is removable."}
