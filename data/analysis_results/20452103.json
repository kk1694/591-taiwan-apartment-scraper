{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including marble accent walls, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC units, and wood laminate flooring. The open layout is clean with good natural light from windows. For baby safety, the glass-top table has sharp corners that would need padding, and there's a small step between flooring sections; no visible balcony railings or stairs in photos. Overall clean condition suitable for a family."}
