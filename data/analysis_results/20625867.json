{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, video intercom, and high-quality finishes throughout. The 10th floor unit in an 18-story building offers great natural light and city views from large windows with a window seat nook in the bedroom. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp metal edges and the large floor-to-ceiling windows are concerns, but the windows appear to have secure fixed panels; no balcony is visible, which is a plus. The apartment is clean, spacious at ~19 ping, and includes a dehumidifier and cordless vacuum, suggesting a well-maintained living space."}
