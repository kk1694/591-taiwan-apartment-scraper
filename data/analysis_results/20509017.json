{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "Spacious, modern apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, recessed LED lighting, built-in TV wall unit, ceiling-mounted AC, and a well-equipped enclosed kitchen with sliding glass door. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling balcony windows on 8F. For baby safety: the balcony has metal railings visible through the sliding doors that should be checked for spacing; the smooth tile floors are slippery and may need rugs; the frosted glass room divider door has sharp wooden frame corners at toddler height. The unit is unfurnished, clean, and move-in ready — a quality higher-end apartment, though Wanhua is an older, more traditional district."}
