{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with clean white walls, polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and wall-mounted AC units. The space is on the 12th floor of a 15-story building suggesting elevator access. For baby safety, balcony railings appear to have proper height but the unit is completely empty so furniture placement will determine hazards; no visible sharp corners or stairs but the balcony access should be secured with a gate. Good natural light from multiple windows with views of surrounding high-rises."}
