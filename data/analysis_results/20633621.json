{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua, near river (likely Tamsui River area based on river and bridge views)", "notes": "Very modern, high-end penthouse unit on the 26th floor with sleek wood-look flooring, recessed LED lighting, large flat-screen TV, modern kitchen, and floor-to-ceiling windows offering panoramic river and city views. The large windows on a 26th-floor unit are a significant baby safety concern — they appear to reach fairly low and would need childproofing; no visible balcony but the window sills are low enough to warrant attention. Excellent natural light, very clean and well-maintained condition; spacious open-plan living area is great for a family, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad) which is a minor red flag — verify lease terms and actual layout details directly."}
