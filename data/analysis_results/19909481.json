{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern light wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, split AC units, and clean white built-in cabinetry throughout. The spacious open-plan living area has large windows providing decent natural light, and the bedroom features a built-in window bench and desk area. For baby safety, the windows have security grilles which is good, but the raised platform/bench in the bedroom could be a fall hazard for a crawling toddler; being on 12F/12F (top floor) may mean no elevator in an older walk-up building, which would be very difficult with a stroller. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad) which is a minor red flag — ask about kitchen, bathroom, and elevator access."}
