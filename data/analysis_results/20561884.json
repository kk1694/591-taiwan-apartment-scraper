{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Clean, well-maintained older apartment with traditional wooden cabinetry and dated but functional fixtures. The living room is spacious with glossy tile floors, and the kitchen has an L-shaped counter with gas stove; the bathroom has a glass shower enclosure and older-style vanity. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp oval edges, the glass shower door and decorative metal partition between kitchen and living room could be concerns, and windows have security bars which are good; however, the 3rd floor walk-up with no visible elevator may be challenging with a stroller. The listing via a Japanese real estate agency (奥村不動産) has a very sparse description that is essentially just an ad upsell, which is a red flag for limited information."}
