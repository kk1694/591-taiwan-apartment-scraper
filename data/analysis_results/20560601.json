{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained luxury apartment on the 13th floor with marble flooring in living/dining areas, hardwood in bedrooms, recessed LED lighting, and multiple split AC units. The large windows provide excellent natural light and city views. For baby safety, the windows appear to have secure frames but the marble floors in living areas can be slippery; no visible balcony railings or open staircases are a concern, and corners on glass/marble coffee tables should be padded. Very clean condition with at least 3 bedrooms, plenty of space for a growing family, though the listing description is minimal (agent promotion text only) which is a minor red flag."}
