{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with stylish track lighting, stone accent wall, built-in cabinetry, and clean tile flooring throughout. The living room has large windows with good natural light and a balcony with metal railings that appear adequately spaced but would need baby-proofing; the walk-in closet and built-in bedroom storage are well-designed. For baby safety, the tile floors are slippery, the glass shower enclosure has sharp edges, and exposed electrical cords near the TV wall should be secured. At 58.57 ping this is a spacious unit in excellent condition with no major red flags — a strong option for a growing family in Songshan."}
