{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with stylish dark accent walls, contemporary lighting fixtures, and updated white kitchen with gas stove and range hood. Good natural light from large windows with mountain views. For baby safety: the coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but the low window sills in the living room and bedroom may need safety guards; no visible balcony railings to worry about. Clean condition overall."}
