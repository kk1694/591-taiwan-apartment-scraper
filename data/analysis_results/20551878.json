{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Spacious 58-ping unit on 11F with decent city/mountain views and good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows and balcony access. The interior is dated with a somewhat luxurious but aging style—dark wood floors, leather sofas, ornate mirror panels, and a glass dining table with sharp edges; the bed frame has no mattress, and the kitchen appears basic. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, the balcony sliding doors open to a railing that would need childproofing, and the diamond-pattern mirror wall could be a hazard if it breaks; the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag about transparency."}
