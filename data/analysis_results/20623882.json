{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including wood-grain flooring, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture. The space appears clean and well-maintained with a bright living area, separate bedroom with city views, and a functional kitchen with balcony access for laundry. For baby safety, the balcony door has a screen but the railings should be checked; the furniture has some rounded edges but coffee tables have hard corners. Being on the 11th floor of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
