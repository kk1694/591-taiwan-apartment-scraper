{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with high-end custom built-in cabinetry, wood-tone finishes, sleek kitchen with glass backsplash, and stylish pendant lighting. The unit is on the 14th floor of a 19-story building (very likely has elevator), with good natural light from large windows and a balcony with mountain views. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling dark-framed glass doors/railings that appear secure, but the open shelving units have many reachable edges and the kitchen area is compact with exposed countertop corners; the breakfast bar has metal legs a toddler could bump into. Overall very clean and well-maintained, though the 20-ping size may feel tight for a growing family."}
