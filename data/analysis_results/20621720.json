{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with polished tile floors, recessed ceiling lighting, and modern kitchen with stainless steel appliances and island counter. The unit appears very clean and well-maintained with large windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the flat single-level layout is positive but the hard tile floors throughout and sharp counter edges in the kitchen would need consideration."}
