{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment on the top floor (12F) with high-end finishes including marble-look tile flooring, recessed lighting, wood-grain ceiling panels, and built-in cabinetry. Excellent natural light with mountain views from multiple windows. For baby safety, the polished tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling/toddling baby, and the bathroom has a glass shower partition with sharp edges; however, no visible open balcony or dangerous railings were observed. The kitchen area is compact with a small sink setup. Being on the top floor of a 12-story building strongly suggests an elevator is present."}
