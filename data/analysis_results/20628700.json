{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, and polished tile floors in living areas. The glass coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need baby-proofing, and windows have security grilles which are good for safety. Two bedrooms visible with adequate storage; one has hardwood flooring. Natural light appears moderate through the windows. Clean condition overall but minimal photos of kitchen/bathroom details."}
