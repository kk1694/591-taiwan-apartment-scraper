{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "This listing at 30 ping (99 sqm) is a decent size for a couple with a baby, but it is on the 5th floor of a 5-floor building which very likely means no elevator — a significant concern for carrying a stroller and baby supplies. The description contains only a generic advertising message with no real property details, which is a red flag suggesting this may be a placeholder or bait listing. Without photos or a meaningful description, it is impossible to assess modernity, baby safety features, or overall condition."}
