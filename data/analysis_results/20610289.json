{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "中山路6段405巷", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with traditional Taiwanese decor, polished granite floors, and dated fixtures. The balcony has metal railings with wide gaps that pose a climbing hazard for toddlers and would need safety barriers. Good natural light through large windows, overall clean condition but the building and interior show their age."}
