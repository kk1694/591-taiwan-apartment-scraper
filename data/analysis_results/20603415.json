{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and modern apartment in Da'an district with recessed LED lighting, marble-look accent walls, polished tile floors, and a large L-shaped sofa in the living area. The kitchen is clean with a gas stovetop and adequate counter space. Bedrooms are generously sized with sliding glass balcony doors. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the sliding glass doors to the balcony should be checked for secure locks; the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent), the 14-floor building on the 2nd floor very likely has an elevator. The description is minimal (just an ad for the agent's package) so no additional details on layout or amenities are available."}
