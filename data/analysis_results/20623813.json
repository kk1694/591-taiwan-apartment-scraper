{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed lighting, wood-grain flooring, and contemporary furniture. The unit appears well-maintained with good storage throughout. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors which should be kept locked, and the coffee tables have metal frames with somewhat sharp edges that may need padding. The 11th floor location in a 15-story building strongly indicates elevator access."}
