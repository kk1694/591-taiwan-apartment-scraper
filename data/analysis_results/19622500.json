{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with modern open kitchen, stylish pendant lighting, and contemporary bathroom with glass shower partition. Being on 5F/5F (top floor) with sloped ceilings suggests a walk-up building without elevator. Baby safety concerns include the glass shower door, open kitchen layout with bar stools, and visible stairs/loft area in the bedroom which would need gating once the child is mobile."}
