{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern Japanese-inspired design, recessed lighting, wood-tone flooring, and a stylish kitchen with gas stove and decorative tile backsplash. The living area has large sliding glass doors to a small balcony with reasonable railing height. For baby safety, the open kitchen layout and sliding doors to the balcony would need childproofing; the bathroom has an open wet-room shower with slippery terrazzo tile that could be a concern. At 3F with no elevator in a 5-floor walkup building, carrying a stroller up stairs daily would be a significant inconvenience for parents with a baby."}
