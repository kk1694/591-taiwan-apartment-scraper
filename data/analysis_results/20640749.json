{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated dark wood cabinetry and glass-paneled shelving units, white tile floors throughout. The space is decent-sized at ~29 ping with a living room, dining area, kitchen, and bedroom visible. The glass coffee table with sharp corners and large glass display cabinets are potential baby safety hazards; the bedroom window appears to have limited natural light blocked by a colorful awning. Being on 3F of a 4F walk-up building with no elevator would be challenging with a stroller and baby gear, and some moving boxes suggest the unit is in transition."}
