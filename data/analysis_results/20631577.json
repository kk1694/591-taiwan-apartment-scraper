{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with clean white tile floors, multiple AC units, and large balcony with floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors. The balcony has appropriate railings for baby safety. Very clean condition with good natural light through multiple windows. No visible sharp corners or hazards, but exposed TV cables near floor level would need to be secured for a crawling baby."}
