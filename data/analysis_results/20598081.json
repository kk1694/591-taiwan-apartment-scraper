{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Fuxing South Road Section 1, Da'an District, 127m from Zhongxiao Fuxing MRT", "notes": "Newly renovated high-end studio (獨立套房) in a 13-floor elevator building with SC/SS earthquake-resistant structure. Move-in ready with full furnishings, appliances, balcony, and building amenities (fitness room, reception hall). Agent specializes in expat rentals with English/Korean staff. However, at 7.54 usable ping (~25 sqm) it is quite small for a couple with a baby, and the balcony should be checked for child-safe railings. Management fee of NT$2,686/month adds to the already high rent. The 37% public space ratio means actual living space is limited despite the 13.43 ping listed size."}
