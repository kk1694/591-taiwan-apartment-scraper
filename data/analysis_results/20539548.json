{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained modern apartment with hardwood floors, recessed LED lighting, stone accent walls, and large panoramic windows providing excellent natural light with mountain views. The open-plan living area is very clean with minimalist furnishings. For baby safety, the large windows appear to have secure frames but the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings. At 45 ping on the 15th floor of an 18-story building, this is a high-quality upscale unit suitable for a family, though the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and kitchen/bathroom condition."}
