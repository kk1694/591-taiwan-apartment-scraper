{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern open-plan layout, clean white walls with green accent walls, new wood-tone kitchen cabinets, and laminate flooring throughout. The space is very clean, spacious, and well-lit with natural light from windows. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is a plus, corners on built-in shelving and the kitchen counter are mostly rounded or low-profile, but the open kitchen area would need baby-gating; no dangerous balcony railings visible in photos."}
