{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "High-end, brand-new luxury apartment in a 23-floor building with recessed LED ceiling lighting, built-in cabinetry, light wood flooring, and concealed ducted air conditioning. The balcony has glass railings which are a serious baby safety concern as a toddler could potentially climb furniture near them; however the glass panels appear to be full-height. The unit is unfurnished with clean, pristine finishes and good natural light from large sliding glass doors. No stairs or sharp corners visible, and the flat layout is generally baby-friendly once furnished."}
