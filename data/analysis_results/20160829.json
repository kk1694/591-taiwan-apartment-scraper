{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very well-appointed modern apartment with high-end finishes including marble-look stone walls, crystal chandeliers, recessed LED lighting, modern leather sofa, and a sleek kitchen with LG refrigerator and Sakura gas cooktop. The space is clean and well-maintained with built-in cabinetry and a breakfast bar. For baby safety, the balcony visible in image 3 has railings that should be checked for gap spacing, and the glossy tile floors could be slippery; the sharp corners on the coffee table and kitchen counter are potential hazards. Natural light appears moderate from the balcony-side windows. At 29.4 ping in Xinyi District on the 4th floor of a 13-story building (likely has elevator), this is a premium listing at a reasonable price for the area."}
