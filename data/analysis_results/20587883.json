{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated finishes including arched doorways, window AC units, and basic bathroom fixtures. Clean but minimally furnished with only mattresses on floors. Limited natural light from small windows with security bars, and exposed wiring visible near AC units could be a safety concern for a crawling baby. The bathroom has hard tile floors and exposed plumbing that may need child-proofing."}
