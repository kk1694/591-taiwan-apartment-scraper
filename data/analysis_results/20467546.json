{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern loft-style apartment with high ceilings, exposed ductwork, and contemporary furnishings. The unit has a mezzanine level accessed by steep stairs visible in images - this is a significant baby safety concern. The building appears upscale with a fancy lobby/lounge area shown in image 2, confirming elevator access. Balcony visible with sliding doors; natural light is decent through floor-to-ceiling windows. Clean and well-maintained but compact space."}
