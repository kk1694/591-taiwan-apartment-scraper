{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment with clean polished tile floors and built-in dark wood cabinetry, but the fixtures (chandeliers, intercom, AC units, sliding doors) appear dated from the 1990s-2000s era. There is a balcony with sliding glass doors visible in several photos — the balcony railing height and gap spacing should be verified for baby safety. The unit is very clean with good natural light from the 8th floor, and the large open floor plan with no stairs is suitable for a family, though the completely empty unit means all furniture must be provided."}
