{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment with renovated kitchen featuring granite countertops and sleek white cabinetry, updated bathroom with glass-enclosed shower and modern fixtures. The bedroom has laminate flooring and built-in wardrobes. Being on the top floor (7F/7F) with no elevator info is a concern for carrying baby items. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with good natural light, though the bathroom glass shower door edges could pose safety concerns for a toddler."}
