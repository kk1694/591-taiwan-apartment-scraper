{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/office space rather than a residential apartment - features include track lighting, exit signs, double doors at entrance, and completely empty unfurnished layout typical of retail or office use. The space is very clean with modern white finishes, but lacks kitchen, bathroom fixtures, or any residential features visible. Not suitable for a family with a baby as it would require significant conversion to residential use."}
