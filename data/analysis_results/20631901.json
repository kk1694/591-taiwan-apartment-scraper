{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Well-renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern light wood flooring, elegant ceiling moldings, crystal light fixtures, and quality dark wood built-in cabinetry. The spacious open-plan living and dining area is very clean with good natural light from large windows. The glass coffee table has sharp metal edges that would need baby-proofing, but overall the flat layout with no visible stairs is good for a family with a baby. At 47.4 ping this is a generously sized unit; however, only living/dining areas are shown — no bedroom, kitchen, or bathroom photos are available, and the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag."}
