{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Modern, spacious apartment in a newer high-rise building (13F/14F) with recessed lighting, clean white tile floors, and built-in ceiling AC. The unit is mostly unfurnished with a large open living area, at least two bedrooms (one with a double bed, one smaller room with a desk), and appears very clean. For baby safety, the tile floors are smooth and easy to clean but slippery; the balcony visible through the living room window has proper railings; no visible stairs or sharp corners are a concern. The description is minimal (just an agent promotion), which is a minor red flag — confirm layout details and whether kitchen/bathroom are included."}
