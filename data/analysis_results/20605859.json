{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new, unfurnished modern apartment in a high-rise building (8F/26F) with recessed lighting, central AC, sleek grey kitchen cabinetry, Whirlpool refrigerator, induction cooktop, and modern dark-tiled bathroom. The unit is very clean with glossy white tile floors and no visible hazards; the lack of furniture means no sharp corners, but the slippery tile floors could be a concern for a crawling baby. Large windows provide decent natural light, and the unit appears to be in move-in ready condition with a digital door lock, though being completely unfurnished means significant setup is needed."}
