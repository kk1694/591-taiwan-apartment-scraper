{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, light wood flooring, built-in LED lighting, modern kitchenette with induction cooktop and stainless steel sink. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency). The space appears to be a well-furnished studio/1-bedroom with a double bed and living area. For baby safety: no visible balcony railings or stairs, but the floor-to-ceiling windows need childproofing; furniture has mostly rounded edges which is positive. Natural light is decent from the tall windows. At 15 ping for NT$50K in Da'an, this is reasonably priced for the quality, though the description is minimal (just an agent ad) which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and amenities."}
