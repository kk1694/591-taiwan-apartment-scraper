{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Artsy loft-style apartment with exposed wooden beams, rustic wood shelving, and a bohemian aesthetic. The glass coffee table has sharp edges and the wooden ladder to the mezzanine/loft area is a serious baby safety hazard — no guardrails visible on the loft level. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling balcony windows, but the wood flooring shows significant wear and the overall style is more eclectic/aged than modern. The large decorative tree trunk sculpture and open shelving also pose climbing and tipping risks for a toddler."}
