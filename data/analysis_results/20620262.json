{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment with polished tile floors, modern AC units in multiple rooms, and elegant ceiling light fixtures. The unit appears spacious with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors with metal railings visible - parents should ensure secure locks; the tile floors are slippery when wet. No visible stairs or sharp corners, overall a well-maintained family-friendly space on a high floor (10F) which strongly suggests elevator access."}
