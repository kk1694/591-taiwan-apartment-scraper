{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment with clean white walls, polished tile floors, stylish pendant lighting, wall-mounted AC, and contemporary furniture throughout. The spacious open-plan living/dining area has large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a balcony, a separate bedroom visible, and a modern glass-enclosed bathroom. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the balcony sliding doors should be checked for secure child locks; the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery. Overall excellent condition with good natural light from the large windows, no visible red flags — a strong option for a couple with a baby at 39 ping in Zhongshan district."}
