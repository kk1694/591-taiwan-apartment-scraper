{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near Taipei 101", "notes": "Very modern, high-floor luxury apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, polished tile flooring in the living area, and wood flooring in bedrooms. The unit is unfurnished with a spacious open living room, kitchen counter, built-in wardrobes, and AC units. Excellent natural light from large windows on multiple sides with city views including Taipei 101. For baby safety, the unit appears single-level with no stairs, and windows have secure black frames; however, the hard tile floors in the main area would benefit from soft mats, and the kitchen counter has sharp corners that may need padding. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), which is a positive sign for an expat couple."}
