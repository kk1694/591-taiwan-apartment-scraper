{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This space has an office-like appearance with commercial drop ceiling tiles and fluorescent panel lights rather than residential fixtures. The space is clean but dated with basic finishes. Windows have security grilles which may indicate a commercial/ground-adjacent unit. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout and lack of visible bedrooms or living spaces raise concerns about this being suitable residential housing - it may be office or commercial space being rented as residential."}
