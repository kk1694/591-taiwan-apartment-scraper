{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with polished tile floors in the living area and dark wood floors in bedrooms. The unit features a spacious living room, a modern kitchen with breakfast bar, built-in cabinetry, and at least two bedrooms. For baby safety, the balcony railings visible in the bedroom window appear to be iron/decorative style with gaps that may need childproofing; the large open living area with hard tile floors would benefit from soft mats. Natural light is moderate with windows in the living room and bedrooms, though surrounded by nearby buildings. The apartment is clean and move-in ready, listed through an agent (大蕎房屋), and at 63 ping on the 4th floor of a 7-story building it likely has an elevator."}
