{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Neihu, near Fuxing Minquan (復興民權)", "notes": "This is a recently renovated 2-story townhouse/row house with modern kitchen, stylish bathroom with LED mirror, and new laminate flooring. However, it appears to be a converted ground-floor commercial/garage-type space rather than a standard apartment — image 1 shows a wide open garage-like entrance with terrazzo flooring. Major baby safety concerns: interior stairs between 1F and 2F with open railings that a toddler could slip through, an outdoor area with exposed pipes and railings with wide gaps, and the open staircase has no gate. Natural light appears limited on the ground floor as windows are small and barred."}
