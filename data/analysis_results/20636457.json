{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with fresh paint, new wood-style laminate flooring, and modern recessed lighting throughout. The unit is clean and spacious with multiple rooms and good natural light from windows with security grilles. For baby safety: no visible balcony hazards, windows have protective metal grilles, and the flat single-level layout with no stairs is ideal; however corners of built-in desks/shelving near windows may need padding."}
