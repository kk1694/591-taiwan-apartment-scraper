{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with white minimalist finishes, updated kitchen with induction cooktop, modern cabinetry, and a refrigerator. The unit has a loft-style sleeping area with low ceiling clearance which is a significant baby safety concern — the loft bed has no visible railing and a child could roll or fall off the edge. The separate room could work as a nursery. Good natural light through zebra blinds on multiple windows. AC units in each room. Managed by Dingli Rental Service. At 18 ping with a loft layout on the 6th floor, space is tight for a couple with a baby; the loft stairs/ladder access would be impractical and dangerous with a small child."}
