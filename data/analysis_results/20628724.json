{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated furniture and fixtures; tile floors are clean but the overall decor is from the early 2000s or older. The unit appears to be currently occupied with significant clutter (bicycles, exercise equipment, books, personal items) making it hard to assess the true layout. For baby safety, the second bedroom has a sliding glass door to a balcony/laundry area that would need child-proofing, and there are sharp-cornered wooden furniture pieces throughout. Natural light is decent from windows with security grilles, but at NT$62,000/month for a non-modern 3F walk-up (no elevator evidence), this seems overpriced for the condition shown."}
