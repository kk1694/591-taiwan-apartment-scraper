{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, beautifully renovated apartment with high-end finishes including light wood flooring, sleek kitchenette with induction cooktop, modern bathroom with glass shower partition, and LED accent lighting. However, this appears to be a loft-style unit where the bedroom is in a mezzanine/loft area with a very low ceiling — a major concern for a couple expecting a baby, as the cramped sleeping space and loft access (likely via steep stairs or ladder) would be impractical and unsafe with an infant. The living area has floor-to-ceiling windows with a balcony railing visible outside, which would need baby-proofing. Good natural light in the main room but no windows in the loft bedroom area."}
