{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment with pristine white finishes, recessed lighting, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing abundant natural light. The unit appears newly renovated with a modern kitchen featuring extensive cabinetry and built-in storage. For baby safety, the windows have horizontal security bars which is positive, though the polished tile floors may be slippery; no visible balcony railings of concern. Very clean condition with no red flags."}
