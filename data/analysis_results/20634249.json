{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreign-friendly rental agency). Features recessed LED lighting, designer furniture, large flat-screen TV, modern dining set, and clean neutral tones throughout. The space appears spacious at ~30 ping with large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and there appears to be a balcony with glass doors that should be checked for secure railings; the open floor plan is otherwise good for a family. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), so details on layout and rooms are unclear despite the premium price of NT$100K/month."}
