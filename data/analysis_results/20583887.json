{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern recessed and LED ceiling lighting, light wood-tone flooring, and clean white/grey walls throughout. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at 30 ping with multiple rooms visible. For baby safety, the flat open layout with smooth flooring is a plus, but the unit is on 3F of a 5-story walkup (no elevator evidence), which would be challenging with a stroller; natural light appears limited with only one visible window in the living area, which is a concern."}
