{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with clean finishes, light wood flooring in main areas, and built-in storage throughout. Good natural light from large windows with balcony access. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings that would need childproofing, and the small breakfast bar stools could be a concern; otherwise the flat layout with no stairs is suitable for a family."}
