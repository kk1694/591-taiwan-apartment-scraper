{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern light gray flooring, recessed LED ceiling panels, and clean white walls. Very spacious open layout (30 ping) with good natural light from large windows. The flat, single-level floor plan and lack of visible stairs or sharp edges make it reasonably baby-safe, though you would want to confirm balcony/window security and add corner protectors to door frames."}
