{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District, near Taipei 101 view, 台北市松山區延吉街", "notes": "This is a spacious but dated apartment in a high-rise building with views of Taipei 101. The living room is large with polished tile floors, recessed ceiling lighting, and air conditioning, but fixtures and furnishings (old CRT-style TV, worn sofa, outdated kitchen) feel 15-20 years old. The bedroom has wood flooring and large windows with good natural light and a balcony with railings visible — the balcony railing height and window access on the 10th floor are a safety concern for a baby/toddler. The glass coffee table with sharp edges in the living room is another baby-proofing concern, though the open floor plan with minimal furniture provides good crawling space."}
