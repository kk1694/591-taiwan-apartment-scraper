{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older but well-maintained apartment in a nicely landscaped building complex. The interior shows dated fixtures with traditional wooden cabinets and an older-style bathroom, though clean. For baby safety, the tile floors are easy to clean but hard if falling; no visible dangerous balcony railings but the kitchen leads to a small service balcony with door access. Natural light appears moderate through windows. The building entrance and grounds look well-kept with security gate."}
