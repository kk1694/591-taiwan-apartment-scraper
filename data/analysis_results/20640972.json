{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern, well-renovated apartment with new built-in wardrobes, sleek kitchen with induction cooktop, and contemporary wood-tone finishes throughout. The unit appears clean and in excellent condition with recessed lighting and air conditioning. For baby safety, the space is fairly compact with narrow corridors; no visible balcony railings or stairs, but limited natural light in the bedrooms which appear windowless or have minimal windows. The kitchen window has security bars."}
