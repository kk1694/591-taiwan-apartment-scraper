{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Chengde Road Section 1, Zhongshan District, near Zhongshan MRT Station (300m) and Yuanhuang/Nanjing Station (92m)", "notes": "High-end 2BR/2BA move-in ready apartment in a 14-story elevator building with full furnishings including AC, washer, fridge, and natural gas cooking. Pet-friendly and close to MRT, which is convenient for a growing family. At 39.82 ping with a balcony, there is good space for a couple with a baby, though the balcony railings should be inspected for child safety; the management fee of NT$5,300/month and 2-month deposit add to the cost. Overall a strong option in a prime Zhongshan location with excellent transit access."}
