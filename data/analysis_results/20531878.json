{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated unfurnished apartment with clean white walls, recessed and flush-mount LED lighting, central AC, and high-quality tile flooring throughout. Listed by Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), the unit is spacious at 38 ping with multiple rooms and en-suite bathroom visible. Good natural light from large windows with sheer curtains. Baby safety is generally favorable with no visible stairs, balcony railings, or sharp corners, though the hard tile floors would benefit from soft mats or rugs for a crawling baby. The unit appears completely empty/unfurnished, so all furniture would need to be provided. Being on 5F of a 12F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
