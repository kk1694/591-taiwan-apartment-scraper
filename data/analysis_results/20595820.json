{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxury modern apartment in excellent condition with high-end finishes including marble accent walls, recessed lighting, and a well-equipped kitchen with built-in appliances. The open floor plan with large sliding glass doors to the balcony provides excellent natural light. For baby safety, the balcony has glass railings which should be checked for proper height; the hard tile floors throughout are very clean but could be slippery for a crawling baby. No visible stairs or sharp corners, and the space appears very spacious and well-maintained."}
