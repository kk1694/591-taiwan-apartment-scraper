{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment in clean condition with recessed lighting, split AC, modern kitchen with gas stove, and hardwood flooring in the upper mezzanine bedroom area. Major baby safety concern: the loft has open staircase with no railing or gate, and the mezzanine level has horizontal slat railings that a child could climb — both are significant fall hazards. The kitchen opens to a small balcony. Good natural light from large windows; overall well-maintained but the split-level layout is not ideal for a family with a baby."}
