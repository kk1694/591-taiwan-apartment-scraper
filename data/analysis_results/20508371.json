{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with extensive built-in wood cabinetry, central and split AC, recessed lighting, and quality flooring. Clean and spacious with good natural light from large windows with security grilles. For baby safety, the space has rounded furniture edges and no visible stairs, though the low window sills with built-in storage could be a climbing hazard for toddlers. Being on 4F of a 4-story building without elevator noted is a concern for carrying a stroller and baby."}
