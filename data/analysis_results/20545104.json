{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Empty unfurnished apartment with dated aesthetic - older style wood-trimmed baseboards and doors, basic tile flooring throughout. The space is clean but appears to have been recently vacated with no furniture or appliances visible except wall-mounted AC units. For baby safety, the large sliding glass doors to what appears to be a balcony would need childproofing; the tile floors are slippery and hard. Natural light appears limited based on window views showing neighboring buildings close by."}
