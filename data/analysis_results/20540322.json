{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with bright white walls, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and large sliding glass doors providing good natural light. The living room appears spacious with minimal furniture and smooth tile flooring, which is easy to clean but slippery for a crawling baby. The balcony glass doors and 10th floor elevation warrant childproof locks; listed via UR HOUSE (foreign-friendly rental agency) which is a plus for expat tenants."}
