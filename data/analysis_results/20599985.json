{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxury modern apartment in excellent condition with high-end finishes, recessed lighting, and quality furniture. Very clean with spacious open living area, separate bedroom, modern kitchen with gas stove, and enclosed laundry area. Floor 12/15 strongly suggests elevator. Baby-safe with no visible stairs or hazardous balcony railings; smooth tile floors are easy to clean but may be slippery. The apartment appears well-maintained and suitable for a family, though natural light assessment is limited by curtains being closed."}
