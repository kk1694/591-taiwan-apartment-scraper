{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "This is a duplex/loft-style apartment with double-height ceilings, a mezzanine bedroom accessed by internal stairs, a separate kitchen with gas stove and SAMPO fridge, and a furnished living/dining area. The unit is clean and well-maintained with modern wood finishes. Major baby safety concern: the internal staircase to the loft bedroom has no visible gate or railing barriers, posing a significant fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler. The loft bedroom also has a low glass partition overlooking the living room below, which is dangerous for small children. Natural light appears decent in the living room from tall curtained windows but limited in the loft bedroom. Listed through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency, which specializes in foreign tenants."}
