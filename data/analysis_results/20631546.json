{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes, recessed LED lighting, contemporary furniture, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. The space appears very clean with smooth tile floors and no visible sharp corners or hazards. There is a balcony visible through the curtains which would need safety gates for baby proofing; the glass coffee table corners could also pose a risk for a crawling baby."}
