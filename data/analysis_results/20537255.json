{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older Taiwanese apartment with dated furnishings including traditional dark wood furniture, window-unit AC, and mismatched colorful bedding across multiple bedrooms. The place is reasonably clean and spacious at 26 ping with good natural light from windows with security grilles. For baby safety, the windows have metal security grilles which is positive, but the open red metal ladder shelves in multiple rooms have tippable edges, and the low wooden furniture has sharp corners that would need padding; being on 2F of a 4F walkup building means stair access only which is inconvenient with a stroller."}
