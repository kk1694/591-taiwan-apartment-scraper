{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with marble-finish TV wall, recessed LED lighting, split AC, digital door lock, massage chair, and built-in wardrobes in the bedroom. The living room has a raised tatami-style platform area which could be a tripping hazard for a crawling baby, and the step edge between the platform and main floor needs child-proofing. The space appears clean with good artificial lighting, though natural light seems limited to the curtained window area near the platform; only 5 photos were provided showing living room and one bedroom, so kitchen, bathroom, and balcony conditions are unknown."}
