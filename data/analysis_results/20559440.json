{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with marble-look TV feature wall, recessed lighting, split AC units in multiple rooms, polished tile floors, and built-in wood-grain wardrobes. The unit is in excellent, clean condition and appears mostly unfurnished. Natural light comes from horizontal strip windows which are frosted/translucent, limiting views but providing privacy. For baby safety, the low horizontal windows have wide sills that a toddler could climb, and the hard polished tile floors may need rugs; no visible balcony, stairs, or sharp corners which is positive. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat-focused agency) at 10F/12F in Xinyi, this is a solid option for a couple with a baby."}
