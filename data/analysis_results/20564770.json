{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with warm wood flooring, modern kitchen with white cabinetry, split AC units, and a spacious living room with large TV. The unit appears clean with updated fixtures and multiple windows providing decent natural light. At 2F/4F in what looks like an older walkup building (no elevator likely), the low floor is convenient but the glass TV stand, small side tables, and shoe rack area near the entrance could pose baby safety concerns; the sliding wooden partition doors between rooms have no locks which is good for access but the glass panels in them should be checked for safety."}
