{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and modern apartment in excellent condition with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, modern furniture, and split AC units. The unit has at least 2 bedrooms, a large open living/dining area, and appears very well-maintained. For baby safety, the windows have security grilles which is positive, but the glass sliding partitions and sharp-cornered furniture (coffee table, shelving units) would need childproofing; no stairs visible which is good. Good natural light from multiple windows, overall very clean and move-in ready — a strong option at this price point for Datong district."}
