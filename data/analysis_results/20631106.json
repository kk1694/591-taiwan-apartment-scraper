{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with elegant French-inspired design featuring art deco wallpaper, wainscoting, and high-quality furnishings. Excellent natural light through large grid windows with security bars. For baby safety: the open floor plan is relatively safe with no visible stairs, but furniture corners on the ornate wooden bed frame and console tables may need padding. Very clean and well-maintained condition."}
