{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern studio-style apartment in clean condition with polished tile floors, built-in wooden cabinetry, TV, sofa, double bed, ceiling fan, and a compact kitchen with gas stove, range hood, and glass backsplash. There is a small balcony with a washing machine; the balcony has dark metal railings but the glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a baby safety concern. At 14 ping this is essentially a one-room layout which will feel tight for a couple with a baby, and the description is a generic agent advertisement with no real property details, which is a minor red flag. Being on the 11th floor of an 18-story building strongly suggests elevator access, and natural light appears decent from the balcony-side windows."}
