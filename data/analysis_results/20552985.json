{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated but well-maintained hardwood floors, traditional wooden furniture, and older wall-mounted AC units. The spacious 36 ping layout includes a large living room, dining area with built-in cabinetry, and at least two bedrooms with ample storage — good size for a family. For baby safety, the hardwood floors are slippery, the furniture has some sharp wooden corners (dining chairs, bed frames), and windows appear to have security grilles which is a plus; being on 2F of a 6-story walk-up means stairs with no confirmed elevator, which would be inconvenient with a stroller."}
