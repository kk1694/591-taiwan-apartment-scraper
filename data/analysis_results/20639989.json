{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and clean apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). The unit features contemporary built-in cabinetry, a wall-mounted TV, modern kitchen with gas stove and full-size fridge, and a sleek marble-tiled bathroom with glass shower partition. For baby safety, the glass shower door and sharp-edged coffee table are concerns; the kitchen has an open layout with accessible gas stove. Natural light appears limited to the kitchen windows with blinds. Being on 10F of a 14F building strongly suggests elevator access. At 17.61 ping the space is modest for a couple with a baby but is in excellent, move-in-ready condition."}
