{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Luxuriously renovated apartment with high-end finishes including marble-style wall panels, crystal chandeliers, LED accent lighting, polished tile floors in living areas, and dark hardwood in bedrooms. At least 3 bedrooms visible with an open-concept kitchen featuring a breakfast bar. The living room has a balcony with floor-to-ceiling glass doors; baby safety concerns include the slippery polished tile floors, sharp-edged furniture (leather sofa, glass bar stools), and the balcony access which would need childproofing. The 16-story building almost certainly has an elevator, and natural light appears moderate with windows in bedrooms though views are partially obstructed by neighboring buildings."}
