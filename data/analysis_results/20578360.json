{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with clean white built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, polished tile floors, and a spacious living room with large TV and leather sofa. The bedroom has ample storage and light wood flooring. For baby safety, the hard tile floors in the living area are slippery and would need rugs or mats; no visible balcony hazards in the photos but natural light appears limited with only small windows visible. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), so details on layout, kitchen, and bathroom are unknown — worth requesting more photos."}
