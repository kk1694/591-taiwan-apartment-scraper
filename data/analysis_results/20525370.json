{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained, upscale apartment with spacious living room featuring crystal chandelier, recessed lighting, polished tile floors, built-in cabinetry, and large leather sofa. At least 3 bedrooms visible including a master with balcony access and a smaller room suitable as a nursery. The balcony has sliding glass doors (baby safety concern - balcony access on 8th floor needs childproofing), and the highly polished tile floors throughout could be slippery for a toddler. Good natural light from multiple windows in bedrooms; overall very clean and in excellent condition with quality furnishings. Being on 8F of a 14F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
