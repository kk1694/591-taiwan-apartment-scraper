{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious 50-ping apartment in a 14-floor building (5F) with decent condition but dated finishes — granite-look tile floors in living area, wood laminate in bedrooms, older-style recessed lighting, and wall-mounted AC units suggest a building from the 2000s or earlier. The living room has large windows with balcony access providing good natural light, and bedrooms have windows on multiple walls. For baby safety, the balcony railings visible through the living room windows should be checked for gap spacing, and the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding; the hard tile floors in common areas are a slip/fall concern for a crawling baby. Overall clean and well-maintained but furnishings are basic and the listing description is essentially empty (just an ad for the agent platform), which is a minor red flag — ask the agent for full details on layout and amenities."}
