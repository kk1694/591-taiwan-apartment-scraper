{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a very dated 1st-floor apartment in an older walkup building in Da'an, with green marble-style flooring, old wooden trim, window-unit AC, and aging fixtures throughout. The covered outdoor area with scooter parking and corrugated roof suggests a typical older Taiwanese ground-floor layout. For a couple with a baby, the hard stone floors, cluttered rooms, older sliding glass doors with metal security grilles, and general lack of modern safety features are concerns; however, the 1F location avoids stair risks and the spacious ~112 ping size provides ample room. Natural light appears limited due to security bars and heavy curtains, and the property would need significant cleaning and updating to feel comfortable."}
