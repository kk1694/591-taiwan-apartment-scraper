{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated older apartment with new laminate flooring, fresh paint, and basic furnishings, but the bathrooms appear dated with old tile work and the overall finishes are budget-grade. The floor plan is spacious with 4 rooms (master bedroom, bedroom A, bedroom B, and a Japanese-style tatami room), 2 bathrooms, a living/dining area, and a kitchen/balcony — good space for a family. Baby safety concerns include frosted glass sliding doors between rooms that could shatter if bumped, the low wooden bed frame with slats, and exposed wiring near the AC units; natural light appears limited as only the tatami room and kitchen/balcony side seem to have exterior windows, and the 2F location means less sunlight overall."}
