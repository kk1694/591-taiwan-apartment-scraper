{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with bright white marble-look tile floors, modern split AC, recessed lighting, glass-enclosed wet/dry separation bathroom, and built-in wardrobes. Very spacious at 61 ping with clean minimalist finishes. For baby safety: the 1F location is convenient (no stair concerns for stroller access), the tile floors are slippery which could be a concern for a crawling/walking toddler, and the outdoor terrace area (image 4) has an open corridor that would need child-proofing; natural light appears limited in the bedroom with small windows facing close neighbors, but overall the unit is in brand-new condition with no visible red flags. Listed through a Japanese real estate agency (奥村不動産)."}
