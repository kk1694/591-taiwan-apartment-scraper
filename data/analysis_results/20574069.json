{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean wood-tone finishes, stylish accent wallpaper in bedroom, and good natural light from large windows with balcony access. The kitchen is extremely compact (mini fridge, single induction burner, tiny sink, washing machine crammed together near the front door), which would be challenging for a family with a baby. The balcony has railings visible but should be checked in person for baby safety; the glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners that would need childproofing."}
