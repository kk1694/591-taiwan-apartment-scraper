{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Dated apartment with older furniture, window AC units, and worn hardwood floors showing its age. The space appears clean but has a distinctly 1990s aesthetic with outdated sofa covers and lighting fixtures. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with metal edges and the exercise equipment visible in the dining area are concerns; no balcony or stairs visible in images but natural light appears limited with only small windows covered by blinds."}
