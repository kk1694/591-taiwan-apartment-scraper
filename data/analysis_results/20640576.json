{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "This is clearly a commercial space, previously used as a hair salon — image 5 shows hair washing station plumbing stubs and a 'STYLEMAP' hair salon poster on the window, while image 3 shows mirrored vanity stations along the wall. The exterior (image 1) shows a storefront with large glass windows, an external metal staircase, and a ground-floor retail shop. Access is via steep outdoor stairs with no elevator, which is dangerous for a family with a baby. This is entirely unsuitable as a residential apartment — it is a commercial retail/salon space on the 2nd floor of an old walkup building."}
