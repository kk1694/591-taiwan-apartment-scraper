{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment on 19F of a 22-story building with high-end finishes including marble-look TV feature wall, recessed lighting, sleek white kitchen with gas stove, built-in microwave, and large stainless steel fridge. The unit is very clean with good natural light from large windows and a window bay seat in the living room. For baby safety, the high floor (19F) means windows must be carefully secured; the windows appear to have proper locks but no visible balcony railings to worry about, and the flat layout with no stairs is ideal for a crawling baby, though the marble-like tile floors in common areas could be slippery."}
