{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, wall-mounted AC, large leather sofa, and a spacious open-plan living area. The space appears very clean and well-maintained with good artificial lighting, though natural light seems limited with small windows. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery, and the glass partition near the living area could be a concern; no visible balcony or staircase hazards in these images. Being on the 6th of 7 floors without confirmed elevator access could be inconvenient with a stroller."}
