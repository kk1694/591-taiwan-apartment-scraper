{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end luxury apartment in excellent condition with modern fixtures, recessed lighting, large windows providing abundant natural light, and elegant white leather furniture. The open floor plan with marble coffee table and crystal chandelier appears very clean and well-maintained. For baby safety, the large windows visible in images appear to have a balcony that would need childproofing, and the polished tile floors may be slippery; the sharp corners on furniture like the coffee table could pose risks for a crawling baby."}
