{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment in a luxury high-rise building with an upscale lobby featuring marble floors and designer furnishings, strongly indicating elevator access. The unit has contemporary wood-look flooring, a kitchen bar counter with stools, built-in shelving, and a clean bathroom with bathtub. For baby safety, the glass partition near the living area and the bar stools could be concerns; the bathtub needs supervision but is useful for bathing a baby. The space is spacious at ~85 sqm, clean, and appears to have decent natural light, though only limited photos of bedrooms are shown."}
