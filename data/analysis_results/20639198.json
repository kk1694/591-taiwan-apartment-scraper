{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a very basic, sparsely furnished room in an older building with terracotta tile flooring, plain white walls, and budget furniture (folding chairs, simple wooden bed frame, basic desks). At 53 ping listed as 1F/1F, this is suspiciously large for NT$45,000 and may be a subdivided older house or partitioned rooms rather than a standard apartment — the description is essentially just an agent ad with no real property details, which is a red flag. For a couple expecting a baby, concerns include the bare-minimum furnishing, folding metal chair (unsafe around children), lack of visible natural light (curtains suggest windows but rooms look dim), and the overall dated condition suggesting potential moisture or maintenance issues in an older ground-floor unit."}
