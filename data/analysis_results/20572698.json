{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end unfurnished apartment with recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, central AC, and sleek white kitchen with gas stove and range hood. The space is extremely clean with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: no visible balconies, all floors are level without stairs, and corners appear rounded; however the hard tile floors would benefit from rugs or mats for a crawling baby."}
