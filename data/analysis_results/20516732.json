{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale European-style interior in a modern high-rise building (14F/15F) in Zhongshan district. The apartment features elegant wainscoting, crystal chandeliers, polished tile and hardwood flooring, recessed lighting, and quality furnishings throughout the spacious living, dining, and bedroom areas. For baby safety, the high floor is a concern — windows and any balcony access should be carefully checked, and the very smooth polished tile floors could be slippery for a crawling toddler. Natural light appears adequate through plantation shutters, and the overall condition is excellent and very clean with no visible red flags."}
