{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with minimalist modern design, featuring light wood flooring, built-in white cabinetry, induction cooktop, sleek kitchen with quartz countertops, and wall-mounted AC. The space appears very clean with smooth rounded furniture edges, though only the living area and kitchen are shown—no bathroom or bedroom views are available. Natural light is limited (small frosted kitchen window, one narrow bedroom window); at 19 ping for NT$80k in Da'an this is a premium studio/1BR. Being on 4F of a 14F building strongly suggests elevator access. Baby safety looks reasonable with no visible balcony or stairs, but the limited photos make a full assessment difficult."}
