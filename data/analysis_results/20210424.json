{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment with crystal chandeliers, glossy tile floors, built-in cabinetry, and modern recessed/cove lighting. The space is very spacious at 57 ping with a large open living and dining area. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp-cornered wooden dining furniture would need padding; the large floor-to-ceiling windows appear to have a balcony railing visible outside but should be verified. Good natural light from large windows. Note: the listing description is minimal (agent promotional text only), which is a minor red flag — request full details on layout and amenities directly from the Dingli Rental Service agent."}
