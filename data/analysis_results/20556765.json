{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older apartment in fair condition with visible wall staining/discoloration in multiple rooms suggesting moisture issues. The kitchen has dated but functional cabinets and gas stove. Windows face a covered outdoor area with limited natural light. For baby safety, the laminate flooring is decent but the exposed wires near windows and aging condition are concerns. The unit appears unfurnished and would need thorough cleaning and repair of water damage before move-in."}
