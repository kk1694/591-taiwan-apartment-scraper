{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older apartment with dated parquet flooring showing wear and scuffed baseboards indicating deferred maintenance. The unit has window-mounted AC, an old-style decorative metal security door, and exposed wiring on walls. Natural light is limited, and the worn condition with chipped paint at baseboards may pose minor concerns for a crawling baby; the balcony appears enclosed with metal grilles which is safer for children."}
