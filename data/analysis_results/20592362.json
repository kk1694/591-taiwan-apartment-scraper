{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, beautifully renovated studio with a murphy bed, built-in cabinetry, light wood flooring, ceiling fan, AC, washer/dryer, desk area, and a sleek bathroom with bathtub. The elevator indicator showing '5F' is visible near the entrance door in image 4. For baby safety, the open studio layout with no stairs is good, but the murphy bed mechanism could be a hazard for a crawling child, and the space at ~12 ping is quite compact for a couple with a baby. Natural light appears limited with small windows behind dark blinds."}
