{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment in Da'an with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, tufted sofas, marble coffee table, and clean white tile flooring in the living area. The bedroom features a raised wooden platform bed area with built-in wardrobe, and there is a dedicated walk-in closet/dressing room with a vanity desk. For baby safety, the hard marble coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the raised bedroom platform could be a fall hazard for a crawling baby; however, the flat tile floors are easy to clean and the overall space is generous at 43 ping. Natural light appears limited as curtains are drawn in most photos, but windows are present in every room. The 14-story building on the 4th floor very likely has an elevator. The listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — an in-person visit is strongly recommended to check kitchen, bathrooms, and balcony conditions."}
