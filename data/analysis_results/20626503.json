{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, spacious apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, and built-in cabinetry throughout. The apartment appears to have multiple rooms including bedrooms with hardwood floors and ample storage. For baby safety, the balcony in image 5 has a standard railing that would need childproofing, and the loft bed in one bedroom could be a concern; otherwise the space is relatively safe with no obvious sharp corners or hazardous features. Good natural light from windows, overall clean and well-maintained condition."}
