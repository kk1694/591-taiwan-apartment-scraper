{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with stylish finishes including marble-look TV wall with LED backlighting, light wood flooring, padded headboard wall, and clean white kitchen with induction cooktop and washing machine. The space appears clean and well-maintained with good natural light from bedroom windows. For baby safety, the low open TV console shelving has accessible sharp corners, and the glass shelf above the dining area could be a concern; no balcony or stairs are visible, which is a plus. The description is minimal (just agent advertising text), providing no useful details about the unit itself."}
