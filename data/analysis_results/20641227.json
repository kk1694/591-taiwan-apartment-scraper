{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated duplex/loft-style apartment with modern white kitchen, recessed lighting, induction cooktop, and light wood laminate flooring throughout. The unit has internal stairs connecting a lower living/kitchen area to an upper mezzanine bedroom level with low ceilings — a significant baby safety concern as the stairs lack visible gates or railings and the loft area has limited headroom. Natural light appears limited, with small windows on the upper level partially covered by frosted film; the main floor gets light through a balcony sliding door. Clean and well-maintained condition, but the multi-level layout with open stairs is not ideal for a crawling baby or toddler."}
