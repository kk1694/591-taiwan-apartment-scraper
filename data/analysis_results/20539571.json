{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with recessed LED ceiling lighting, split AC, built-in wardrobes, and a separate bedroom with a double bed. The unit appears to be two rooms shown from different angles — a living area with sofa, glass coffee table, washing machine, microwave, fridge, and TV, plus a spacious bedroom with full-wall built-in closets. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp edges and exposed metal legs that would need padding; the living area window has floor-to-ceiling glass with what appears to be railings, which is reasonable on 9F. At 23 ping the space is decent for a couple with a baby, though the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), so details on lease terms and kitchen facilities are unclear — no visible stove or proper kitchen area, only a microwave."}
