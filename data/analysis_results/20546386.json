{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is clearly a commercial/retail storefront space, not a residential apartment. It appears to be a gutted former shop or restaurant on the ground floor with exposed concrete floors, industrial ceiling with fluorescent strip lighting, counter structures, and a weathered outdoor deck area. The space is completely unfurnished and in raw condition with cracked concrete, peeling walls, exposed wiring, and no residential fixtures whatsoever. Entirely unsuitable for a couple expecting a baby — it is not a living space and would require full commercial-to-residential conversion."}
