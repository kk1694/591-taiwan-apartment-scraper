{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with designer finishes including herringbone wood flooring, recessed lighting, concrete-effect walls, a sleek open dining/kitchen area, and a luxurious bathroom with freestanding soaking tub and dual vessel sinks. For baby safety, the bedroom has a glass partition wall near the bed area that could be a hazard, and the freestanding bathtub poses a drowning risk requiring constant supervision; the balcony visible through living room curtains should be checked for railing height. At 67 ping on the 4th floor of an 11-story building (almost certainly with elevator), this is a spacious, clean, well-lit upscale unit, though the minimalist dark-toned aesthetic and open-plan layout may need baby-proofing of sharp furniture corners and glass elements."}
