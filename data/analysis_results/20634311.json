{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean condition, built-in cabinetry, modern kitchen with dishwasher, and central AC. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety: the balcony has railings that appear adequate but access should be secured; there's a raised balcony step; no visible stairs. Multiple bedrooms including a furnished children's room suggest family-friendly design. The 10th floor in a 22-story building strongly indicates elevator access."}
