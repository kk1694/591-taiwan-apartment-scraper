{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Shilin", "notes": "This is a multi-level townhouse/villa with stairs (visible in images), not a flat apartment. It features older-style decor with terracotta tile floors, rattan furniture, tatami rooms, and a large decorative soaking tub area with skylights. Major baby safety concerns: internal staircase with glass railings that a toddler could slip through, glass coffee table with sharp edges, elevated soaking tub/pool area is a serious drowning hazard, and the multi-level layout makes it difficult to baby-proof. The space is large (49 ping) with decent natural light from large windows and skylights, but the furnishings and finishes appear dated rather than modern."}
