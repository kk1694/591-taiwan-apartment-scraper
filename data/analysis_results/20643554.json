{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated studio-style apartment with high-end modern finishes including recessed lighting, designer furniture, light wood flooring, textured concrete accent walls, and a large wall-mounted TV. The open layout combines living and sleeping areas with a built-in closet, desk area, and kitchen nook. For baby safety, the open-plan layout with hard furniture edges (marble coffee table, sharp desk corners) and no visible room separation would need childproofing; natural light appears limited as curtains are drawn in all photos, and the lack of separate rooms may be challenging for a growing family despite the stylish renovation."}
