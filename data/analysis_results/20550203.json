{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "The apartment is in fair condition but feels dated — older-style furniture, warm-toned recessed lighting, and appliances from a previous era. The glass coffee table with sharp metal edges and the glass dining table pose baby safety concerns; windows have diamond-pattern security grilles which are good for child safety. The living area gets decent natural light from large windows, and the floors are polished tile (easy to clean but slippery). The listing description is essentially empty (just an ad for agent packages), which is a red flag — no details on layout, amenities, or lease terms, suggesting this may be an agent placeholder listing rather than a genuine rental."}
