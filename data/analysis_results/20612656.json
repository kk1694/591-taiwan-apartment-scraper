{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Recently renovated unit with brand-new minimalist white interior, modern bathroom with black matte fixtures, light wood-look flooring, and track/spot lighting. The space is completely empty and very clean, but the listing description is just an agent ad placeholder with no real details — a significant red flag. The exterior shows an older walkup building (right side of street photo) next to newer high-rises, and at 3F/7F with no elevator confirmed, stairs could be a challenge with a baby. The open-plan wet bathroom (no shower partition) could be slippery and a concern for baby safety; also note the vertical blinds on the large window suggest this could potentially be an office conversion rather than a standard residential apartment — worth verifying in person."}
