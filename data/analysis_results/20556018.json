{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-quality finishes, recessed lighting, and built-in cabinetry throughout. Very clean with smooth tile floors, rounded furniture edges, and no visible balconies or dangerous stairs - relatively baby-safe. Good natural light from multiple windows; the 13-story building on the 5th floor almost certainly has an elevator."}
