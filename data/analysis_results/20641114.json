The 12th floor unit in a 15-story building has good natural light and mountain views. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings that appear closely spaced which is positive, the unit is completely flat with no stairs, and being unfurnished means no sharp furniture corners — however, the hard tile floors would benefit from soft mats, and the unit will need all furnishings purchased from scratch which is a significant additional cost."}
