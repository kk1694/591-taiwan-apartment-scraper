{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes throughout — new light grey wood-look flooring, recessed LED lighting, brand new white kitchen with Rinnai range hood, built-in gas cooktop, and glass backsplash. Spacious living room with natural light from a large window and an enclosed balcony area. The bedroom is generously sized with a wide horizontal window. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is ideal; windows appear to be at safe heights and the floors are smooth without sharp edges, though the kitchen door to the rear service balcony would need child-proofing. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout, number of rooms, and lease terms."}
