{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu, near hillside/mountain greenery", "notes": "Modern high-rise building (14F/20F) in excellent condition with clean tile floors, recessed lighting, and an intercom system. The unit is unfurnished with spacious open living areas, a separate kitchen, and a balcony with glass-and-metal railings overlooking lush mountain greenery. Baby safety note: the balcony railing has glass panels which are reasonably safe but should be monitored; the flat tile floors are good for crawling but the unit will need furniture with rounded corners since it is empty. Good natural light from large sliding glass doors facing the mountain view; the building exterior looks upscale and well-maintained with likely 24hr management."}
