{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with sleek dark accent walls, recessed lighting, open-plan kitchen with island bar, built-in microwave, gas stove, range hood, and Sakura water heater. The unit is very clean with smooth tile floors and good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the open kitchen with bar stools and hard tile flooring are concerns; no bedrooms or bathrooms are shown in the photos, and the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a red flag — only 5 photos of essentially the same living/kitchen area suggest limited disclosure. At 32 ping on the 9th floor of an 11-story building, it likely has an elevator."}
