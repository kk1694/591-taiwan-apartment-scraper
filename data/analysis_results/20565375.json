{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with clean white built-in cabinetry, polished tile floors in the living area, and dark wood laminate in the bedrooms. The living room is spacious with a large leather sofa, flat-screen TV, and recessed lighting. One room has a full glass partition wall which is a significant baby safety concern—a crawling or walking toddler could run into it or it could shatter. The windows have security grilles which is good for child safety, but the slippery polished tile floors could be hazardous for a baby learning to walk. Being on the 6th of 7 floors with no visible elevator clues, and the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag for transparency."}
