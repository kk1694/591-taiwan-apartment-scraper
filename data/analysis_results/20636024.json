{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with high-end finishes including marble TV wall feature, recessed LED lighting, glossy tile floors, and a well-equipped galley kitchen with gas stove and modern cabinetry. The unit includes a walk-in closet/dressing room with hardwood flooring, built-in shelving, and glass-top drawers. For baby safety, the tile floors throughout most rooms are very hard and slippery, the open shelving units have sharp corners and accessible cubbies a toddler could climb, and the glass sliding doors in the living area could be a concern. Natural light appears moderate with windows in bedrooms and kitchen; the apartment is unfurnished, clean, and in excellent condition overall. Being on 3F of a 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
