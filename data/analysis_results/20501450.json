{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated wooden furniture, traditional curtains with valances, and well-worn sofas. The kitchen appears functional but basic with stainless steel counters. For baby safety: the living room has a low coffee table with potentially sharp corners, and windows have metal security bars which can be a concern. Natural light is limited due to dark curtains and security grilles on windows."}
