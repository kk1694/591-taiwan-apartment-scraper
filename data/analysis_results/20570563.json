{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a multi-level duplex/maisonette apartment with internal stairs connecting floors, which is a significant safety concern for a baby - the staircase has wide gaps between balusters and no gates. The apartment appears clean but dated with older style fixtures, crystal chandeliers, and worn tile on the balcony. The balcony railing appears solid but low. Good natural light from windows on multiple sides."}
