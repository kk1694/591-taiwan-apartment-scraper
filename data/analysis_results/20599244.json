{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, hardwood floors, leather sofas, and updated kitchen with gas stove and Toshiba refrigerator. The glass coffee table has sharp edges that could be a concern for crawling babies; large windows provide good natural light but the living room appears to face another building closely. Overall clean and spacious at 28 ping, suitable for a family."}
