{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including marble-look tile flooring, recessed LED lighting, large flat-screen TV, built-in wardrobes, and a sleek front door with digital lock. The living area is very clean and bright with white/cream tones throughout. For baby safety, the marble-look tile floors in the living room could be slippery, the coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but the bedroom has floor-to-ceiling windows that open to what appears to be an outdoor area — railings and balcony safety should be verified in person. No kitchen or bathroom photos provided, and the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag — request more details before committing."}
