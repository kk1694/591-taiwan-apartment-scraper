{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment on the top floor (7F/7F) with beautiful hardwood floors, built-in kitchen, recessed lighting, and abundant natural light from large windows on multiple sides. The unit appears clean and spacious at 32.88 ping with a private elevator opening directly into the unit. Baby safety concerns include the large floor-to-ceiling windows (though they appear fixed/sealed), an elevated window seat area with a step, and being on the top floor may mean potential roof heat in summer; the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — verify layout details and whether it includes bedrooms/bathrooms in person."}
