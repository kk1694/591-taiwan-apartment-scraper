{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Near Dazhi/Neihu area intersection, close to elevated highway", "notes": "This appears to be a ground-floor commercial storefront space, not a residential apartment. The images show only exterior views of an older building with street-level glass storefronts, motorcycles parked outside, and no interior living spaces visible. The building exterior looks dated with visible weathering. Not suitable for a family with baby - it's a commercial space on a busy street with traffic noise from nearby elevated highway, and no residential interior is shown."}
