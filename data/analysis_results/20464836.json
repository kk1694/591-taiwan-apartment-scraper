{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wenshan District", "notes": "Very modern, new-construction apartment with pristine white tile floors, contemporary wood-tone built-in cabinetry, digital door lock, and a sleek white kitchen with gas stove and glass backsplash. The unit is on the 10th floor of a 12-story building with excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the balcony has a solid half-wall railing which is good, but the tile floors throughout are very smooth and slippery; the spare room is empty and could serve as a nursery. The apartment appears brand new or barely lived in, very clean with no visible red flags, though only 5 photos were provided and no bathroom was shown."}
