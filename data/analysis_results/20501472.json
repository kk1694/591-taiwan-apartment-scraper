{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near Taipei 101 with mountain views", "notes": "Upscale modern penthouse (7F/7F) with designer finishes, large glass sliding doors opening to a spacious balcony with panoramic views of Taipei 101 and surrounding mountains. The open balcony and floor-to-ceiling glass panels are a baby safety concern — glass railings and unprotected terrace edges would need childproofing. Only one image available and the description is minimal (agent placeholder text), so layout, number of rooms, and elevator status remain unknown; at 45 ping and NT$98K this appears to be a luxury unit but more photos are needed to fully assess."}
