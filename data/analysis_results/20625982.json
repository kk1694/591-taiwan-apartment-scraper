{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated space with new light-colored vinyl flooring, fresh white walls, modern black-framed glass doors/windows, and new door hardware throughout. However, this appears to be a converted ground-floor or semi-basement space in an older walk-up building — the exterior shows a covered courtyard with steps leading up to the entrance, a metal roller shutter, and fluorescent tube lighting on the ceiling, all suggesting a possible commercial or mixed-use conversion rather than a standard residential apartment. Major baby safety concerns include the exterior stairs with metal railings but no gates, the large glass panels at floor level in the courtyard area, and the raised entrance requiring steps. The listing description is essentially empty (just a 591 ad placeholder), which is a red flag — at NT$80,000/month for 1F in Shilin with no furnishings and an ambiguous layout, this warrants careful in-person inspection to confirm it is genuinely residential."}
