{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern building with clean marble-tiled hallway and elevator visible in corridor. Two bathrooms shown with bathtubs, glass partitions, and modern fixtures. Curved enclosed balcony with floor-to-ceiling windows offers good natural light and city views. The balcony has solid stone walls reaching mid-height which is safer for children, but glass panels above could be a concern. Bathtubs present potential baby safety considerations. Overall clean condition in a well-maintained mid-rise building."}
