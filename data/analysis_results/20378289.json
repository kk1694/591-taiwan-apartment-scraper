{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern industrial-style studio with exposed concrete ceiling, wood laminate floors, projector screen, and contemporary furniture. Has floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access - the balcony railings appear to have wide gaps which could be a safety concern for a baby. Clean and well-maintained, good natural light from multiple windows. Being on the 14th floor of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
