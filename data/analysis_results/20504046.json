{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, beautifully renovated apartment with high-end modern finishes including recessed lighting, stone accent walls, quality furniture, and a spacious open-plan living/dining area. The unit is very clean with smooth tile floors that are baby-friendly, though the coffee table has sharp corners that may need padding. Good natural light through large windows; kitchen has a small balcony with proper railings. The 18-floor building on 6F strongly suggests elevator access."}
