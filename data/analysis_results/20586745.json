{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, upscale apartment with luxury finishes including marble-look flooring, recessed ceiling AC, crystal chandelier, and clean white cabinetry throughout. The open-plan kitchen has a peninsula dining counter with modern appliances. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with metal frame has sharp edges, and the sliding glass partition between living room and bedroom could be a pinch hazard; the marble-like hard flooring would benefit from additional padding. Good natural light visible through bedroom windows with sheer curtains. The listing description is minimal (agent promotion text only), but the unit appears to be a well-maintained 1-bedroom in Da'an district at a premium price point."}
