{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in a modern high-rise building (12F/15F) with clean white tile floors, recessed LED lighting, wall-mounted AC units in multiple rooms, and modern wooden doors. The unit is completely empty with no furniture, which means you would need to furnish it entirely. For baby safety, the balcony visible in image 1 has metal railings that appear adequate, the floors are smooth tile (slippery but easy to clean), and there are no stairs or sharp corners visible — the layout appears to be a single-level flat with multiple rooms, making it quite baby-friendly once furnished. At 40.49 ping this is a spacious unit with good natural light from windows, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — verify details directly with the agent."}
