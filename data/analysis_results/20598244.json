{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Renovated apartment with modern wood-grain flooring, recessed lighting, beige leather sofa, flat-screen TV, full-size refrigerator, and an open kitchen with range hood. The space is clean and well-maintained with a spacious open-plan living area; sliding frosted glass partition doors separate the rooms. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and some loose cables are visible near the TV area; no balcony or stairs are shown, and natural light appears limited as no windows are prominently visible in the photos."}
