{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including polished tile floors, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and a fully equipped kitchen with built-in cabinetry. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, but the open floor plan and flat single-level layout are baby-friendly with no stairs visible. Natural light is moderate with multiple windows in the living room and bedroom; the apartment appears very clean and move-in ready. At 38 ping in Da'an district this is a generous family-sized unit, though the 3rd floor without confirmed elevator could be inconvenient with a stroller."}
