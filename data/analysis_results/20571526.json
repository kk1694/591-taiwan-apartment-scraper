{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, recently renovated apartment with light wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, modern AC units, and built-in cabinets. Very clean and move-in ready condition. Baby safety is good - no visible stairs, sharp corners are minimal, and being on 1F eliminates balcony fall risks. Natural light appears limited based on small windows visible in kitchen; the living area relies on curtained windows. Kitchen is functional with gas stove and microwave."}
