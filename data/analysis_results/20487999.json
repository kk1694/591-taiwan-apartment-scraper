{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a duplex apartment with internal stairs which is a significant safety concern for a baby - no visible railings on the staircase. The unit appears modern and clean with updated fixtures, built-in wardrobes, and decent natural light from windows with blinds. Kitchen has a gas stove and the bathroom looks well-maintained, but the open staircase design would require baby gates and careful childproofing."}
