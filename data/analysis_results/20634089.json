{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated wood-tone furniture, arched doorways, and basic furnishings from the 1990s-2000s era. The unit is clean with white tile floors and includes a living room, bedroom with double bed and wardrobe, kitchen area, and bathroom. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp-cornered coffee table are concerns; natural light appears limited with small windows and security grilles. Only 4 photos were provided which is very few, and the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — suggests minimal effort or a generic broker listing."}
