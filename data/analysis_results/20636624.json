{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with marble-effect floor tiles, recessed LED lighting, split AC units, and clean white finishes. The unit is on the 1st floor which is convenient but may have limited natural light based on images showing nearby buildings through the balcony. Baby safety considerations: the sliding glass doors to the balcony would need childproofing, and the metal bar chairs have open designs that could pose climbing hazards. Overall excellent condition with no visible red flags."}
