{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Renovated older building (exposed ceiling pipes, terrazzo flooring in most rooms, wall-mounted AC units) listed through Elegant Realty expat housing agency. The apartment has 2-3 bedrooms, a living/dining area with modern furnishings, and a kitchen area. Natural light appears limited with narrow windows in some rooms; the bedroom with wood flooring has better window coverage. For baby safety, the exposed pipes and ceiling conduits are out of reach, but the terrazzo floors are hard and cold — area rugs would be advisable. No major red flags, but the building is an older walkup (2F/5F, likely no elevator), which would be inconvenient with a stroller."}
