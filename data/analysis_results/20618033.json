{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment with polished tile floors in living area and wood flooring in bedroom. Spacious open-plan layout with separate dining, living, and kitchen areas, plus a bedroom with glass sliding doors. The glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a baby safety concern, and the staircase visible in image 1 suggests a duplex layout that would need baby gates. Good natural light from multiple large windows with mountain/greenery views; listed via Miller House agency. At 7F of an 11-story building, an elevator is very likely."}
