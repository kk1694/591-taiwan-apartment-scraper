{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious and clean apartment at 66.76 ping with bright white tile floors, split AC units in multiple rooms, a large open living area with sofa and wall-mounted TV, and at least two bedrooms with en-suite bathroom visible; the unit appears recently renovated with modern fixtures. For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling/walking toddler, and the balcony area with sliding glass doors would need child locks; no dangerous stairs visible as it is a single-level unit on the 5th floor of a 15-story building (elevator very likely). The description is minimal agent boilerplate with no real property details, which is a minor red flag — worth confirming actual layout and amenities in person."}
