{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment on 10F/15F in Wanhua with split AC units, hardwood flooring in bedrooms, and large sliding glass doors to a balcony. The living room is spacious at 50 ping but currently cluttered with boxes and exercise equipment; the kitchen is narrow but functional with modern white cabinetry. Baby safety concerns include the balcony sliding doors (need child locks), the wooden wall-mounted ladder/bars in the living room that a toddler could climb, and general clutter that would need clearing. Natural light appears good from the large windows on a higher floor."}
