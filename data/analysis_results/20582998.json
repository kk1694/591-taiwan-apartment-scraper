{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This space is clearly a commercial office, not a residential apartment. It features drop ceiling with fluorescent grid lights, a whiteboard, open-plan office layout with built-in shelving units, and no visible kitchen or bathroom facilities suitable for living. The walls show some staining/aging and exposed wiring hangs from the ceiling. Completely unsuitable for a couple with a baby — no residential amenities, no bedroom privacy, and the office-grade space would require full conversion to be livable."}
