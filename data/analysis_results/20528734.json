{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in near-new condition with high-end finishes throughout: LED accent lighting, light wood flooring, modern kitchen with island bar, stone-tiled bathroom with soaking tub and rain shower, and split AC. The unit has at least two bedrooms (one master, one smaller child-sized room) plus a spacious living area. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, the bathroom has a glass partition with no threshold barrier, and the bar stools could be a tipping hazard; the second bedroom could serve as a nursery. At floor 10 of 12, the building almost certainly has an elevator, and natural light appears decent from the window blinds, though no balcony is visible in the photos."}
