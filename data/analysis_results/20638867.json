{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with polished hardwood floors throughout, furnished with traditional floral sofas and solid wood bedroom furniture. The unit is clean and well-maintained but has dated fixtures including older-style AC units and cabinetry; there is a step/level change between the dining and entryway areas which could be a tripping hazard for a crawling baby. Natural light is moderate from windows in the living room and bedroom, but the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — at 36 ping in Da'an for ~65K it's reasonably priced but the lack of detail warrants follow-up questions about lease terms and building age."}
