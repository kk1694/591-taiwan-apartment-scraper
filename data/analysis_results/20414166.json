{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated unfurnished apartment with recessed LED lighting, light wood laminate flooring, split AC units, and a sleek white kitchen with built-in cabinetry. The unit is on the 7th floor of a 22-story building (very likely has elevator), with large windows providing good natural light and city views. For baby safety, the windows have metal security grilles which is positive, but the unit is completely empty so sharp corners on built-in cabinets and exposed electrical outlets at floor level would need childproofing; no balcony access is visible which is a plus. Clean, move-in ready condition with no visible red flags — listed through An-Ho Real Estate agent."}
