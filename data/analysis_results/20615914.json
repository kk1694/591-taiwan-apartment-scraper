{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, clean apartment with modern white tile floors, AC units in every room, and good natural light from large windows. The living room has a balcony with railings that may need baby-proofing; the hard tile floors throughout could be slippery but are easy to clean. The apartment appears well-maintained with at least 2 bedrooms (one could serve as a nursery), though being on the 7th floor of a 7-story building without confirmed elevator access could be challenging with a stroller."}
