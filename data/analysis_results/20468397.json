{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 59-ping apartment in Datong on 6F/13F with clean tile floors and recessed lighting, but the overall style is dated with older wooden cabinets and traditional Taiwanese furnishings. The balcony has standard metal railings visible through sliding glass doors which would need baby-proofing; the hardwood-floored bedroom has balcony access that should be secured. The unit is unfurnished and very clean with decent natural light, but the listing description is essentially empty (just a realtor ad placeholder), which is a red flag — no details about layout, amenities, or lease terms are provided."}
