{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern loft-style studio with high ceilings, Murphy bed, and contemporary finishes. Major baby safety concerns: steep metal ladder to mezzanine level with open railings, and rooftop pool amenity requires supervision. Kitchen has exposed knife block. Good natural light from balcony, extremely clean and well-maintained, but space is compact for a family with a baby."}
