{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end, hotel-like modern apartment in excellent condition with contemporary finishes. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Baby safety concerns: glass balcony railing has wide horizontal gaps that a toddler could potentially squeeze through or climb, and the glass shower enclosure in bathroom would need supervision. Overall very clean and well-maintained."}
