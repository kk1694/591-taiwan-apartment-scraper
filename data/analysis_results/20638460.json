{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, well-finished apartment with polished marble floors, recessed ceiling lighting, central AC, built-in glass display cabinets, and a high-end kitchen with LG side-by-side refrigerator and built-in oven. The glass-fronted cabinets and polished stone floors could be baby safety concerns — slippery surfaces and breakable glass doors at toddler height would need child-proofing. The unit is mostly unfurnished with generous space at 39.4 ping; natural light appears limited from the few windows visible, but bedroom has at least one window. The listing description is essentially empty (just an ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — request full details from the agent."}
