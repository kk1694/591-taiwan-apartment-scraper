{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, recently renovated unfurnished apartment with recessed LED lighting, light wood laminate flooring, built-in white cabinetry, wall-mounted AC, and clean minimalist finishes. The space is very clean with no sharp corners on built-in furniture, smooth walls, and large windows with curtains; the flat open layout is baby-friendly though exposed wiring near walls needs attention. At 37 ping on the 7th floor of a 22-story building (elevator assumed), this is a spacious and bright unit, but being completely unfurnished means significant upfront cost for furniture and appliances."}
