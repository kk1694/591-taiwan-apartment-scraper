{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment on the top floor (12F) with high-end finishes including marble-look polished tile floors, recessed lighting, designer pendant lights, built-in wardrobes, and a stylish bathroom with glass shower enclosure and LED-lit mirror. The spacious open layout is very clean but the highly polished slippery tile floors are a significant baby safety concern, as are the large windows visible on the high floor; no kitchen is shown in the photos which is a red flag for a family. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), which combined with being a top-floor unit may indicate potential heat or leak issues worth investigating."}
