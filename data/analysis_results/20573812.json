{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with premium finishes including wooden ceiling panels, quality leather furniture, and well-equipped kitchen with built-in appliances and dishwasher. The unit has excellent natural light through large floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the large windows in the bedroom require childproofing, and the glass display cabinets with accessible lower shelves may need baby-proofing. Overall very clean and well-maintained with a contemporary design throughout."}
