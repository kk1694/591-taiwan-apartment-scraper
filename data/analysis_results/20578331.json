{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment on 11F of an 18-story building with excellent natural light from large windows on multiple sides. The unit features at least 2 bedrooms, a spacious living room with polished tile floors, wood-laminate flooring in bedrooms, built-in storage, a chandelier, and furnished with bed frames and a sofa. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows need childproof locks, and the glass display cabinets with sharp edges in the living room are a concern; however, the flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus. Very clean condition, bright and airy, listed through Miller House rental agency — a solid option for a family in Songshan."}
