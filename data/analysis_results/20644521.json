{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "An-Ho (安和) area", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with hardwood floors, quality furniture, split AC, and updated kitchen with gas stove and modern cabinets. The open living/dining layout is spacious and clean. For baby safety: furniture has mostly rounded edges, but the glass-fronted cabinets and sharp-cornered marble coffee table may need childproofing; the small balcony door appears to have security bars. Being on 1F eliminates stair/elevator concerns but may have less natural light - the balcony area looks somewhat enclosed."}
