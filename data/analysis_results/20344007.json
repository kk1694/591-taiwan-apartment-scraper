{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylishly renovated apartment with designer track lighting, wood-look flooring, built-in cabinetry, large TV, and contemporary grey-tone furnishings. The open-plan layout is clean and well-maintained with a kitchen visible behind a partition wall. For baby safety, the sharp corners on the dark angular built-in furniture and TV console are a concern, and the glass partition near the bedroom area would need childproofing; natural light appears moderate from floor-to-ceiling windows with curtains, and the 4th floor in a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
