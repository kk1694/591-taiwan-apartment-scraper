{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and clean apartment with modern white kitchen, built-in cabinetry, and updated fixtures. The open floor plan and polished tile flooring are family-friendly with minimal sharp corners visible. Natural light appears limited in some rooms (bedroom has older window AC unit), but overall the space is well-maintained and would be suitable for a family with a baby."}
