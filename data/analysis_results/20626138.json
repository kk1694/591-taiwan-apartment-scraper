{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious 42-ping apartment in good condition with renovated kitchen (modern black-and-white cabinetry, induction cooktop, range hood) and nicely finished living/dining areas with hardwood floors, crown molding, and stylish lighting. The enclosed balcony has windows with adequate railing height, but being on the 5th floor of a 7-story building without confirmed elevator access could be challenging with a stroller and baby. No obvious sharp corners or major baby safety red flags visible; the space is clean, well-lit, and generously sized for a growing family."}
