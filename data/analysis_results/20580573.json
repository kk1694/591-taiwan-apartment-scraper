{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou, building name appears to be 天璽 (Tianxi)", "notes": "Upscale modern apartment in a well-maintained 15-floor high-rise with elevator. The interior features designer finishes including recessed/accent lighting, built-in cabinetry, central AC, padded wall panels, dark wood flooring in bedrooms, and polished tile in the living room. At 42 ping with at least two bedrooms, it is spacious for a family; the living area has smooth tile floors good for a crawling baby, though the sharp-cornered coffee table and low ottoman would need baby-proofing. Natural light appears moderate with windows in each room behind heavy curtains; balcony railings on the building exterior look adequately tall with narrow spacing, which is positive for child safety."}
