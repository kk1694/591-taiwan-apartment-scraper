{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with designer cove lighting, light wood-look flooring, sage green accent walls, and high-end furnishings including a marble dining table and modern grey sofa. The unit is on the 13th floor of a 26-story building, virtually guaranteeing elevator access. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is good, but the sofa has thin metal legs and the dining chairs have sharp metal bases that could be hazardous; no balcony or windows are visible in photos, which raises concerns about natural light but eliminates balcony fall risk. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — more details about layout, bedrooms, and kitchen/bathroom should be confirmed in person."}
