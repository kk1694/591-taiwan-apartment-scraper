{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern hotel-style studio with high-quality finishes including recessed lighting, built-in storage, and contemporary furniture. Good natural light from large French doors with decorative wrought iron balcony railing. For baby safety, the balcony doors should be secured; space is compact at 23 sqm which may feel cramped with a baby. Being on 5F of a 6F building with no visible elevator info is a concern for stroller access."}
