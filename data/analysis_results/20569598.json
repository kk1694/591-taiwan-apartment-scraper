{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated luxury apartment with designer finishes including marble accent wall, custom wood paneling, central AC, high-end open kitchen with built-in appliances, and hardwood flooring throughout. The large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors open to a wooden deck terrace with greenery — the terrace and glass kitchen island with sharp edges are baby safety concerns that would need childproofing. Excellent natural light from multiple large windows; the space is very clean and spacious at 67.8 ping in Da'an district, though the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag."}
