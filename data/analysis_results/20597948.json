{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with high-end built-in cabinetry in muted blue/grey tones, sleek open kitchen with built-in oven and microwave, polished marble-look tile floors, and split AC units. The unit is unfurnished, spacious, and extremely clean with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the balcony has narrow-spaced metal railings which is good, but the highly polished tile floors could be slippery; the open-plan layout with no stairs and rounded cabinet edges is generally baby-friendly. Being on the 9th floor of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
