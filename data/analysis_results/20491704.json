{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern unfurnished apartment with bright white tiles, recessed lighting, and split AC units. The space appears newly renovated with a minimalist design. Baby safety concerns are minimal - no visible stairs, the balcony has proper railings visible through the large windows, and no sharp corners are evident. Natural light is decent from the floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access on the 12th floor."}
