{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang", "notes": "Luxurious, high-end modern apartment with marble accent walls, recessed lighting, light hardwood flooring, and an open-plan living/dining/kitchen layout. The 60-ping space is very spacious with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. The balcony has horizontal metal railings which would need childproofing as a baby grows; the flat, open layout with no stairs is otherwise baby-friendly, though the low coffee table has sharp edges. Listed via UR HOUSE (a foreign-friendly rental agency), the unit is in immaculate condition in a newer high-rise building on the 9th floor, strongly suggesting elevator access."}
