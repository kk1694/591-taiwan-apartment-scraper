{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in ceiling AC, and a modern kitchen with new cabinetry and countertops. The unit is unfurnished and very clean with no visible sharp corners or hazards; the windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, but being on 6F/6F with no elevator info is a concern for carrying a stroller. The highly polished floors could be slippery for a toddler, and the kitchen has a rear balcony/utility area that would need a gate."}
