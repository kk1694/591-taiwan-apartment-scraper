{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern light wood flooring, stylish light fixtures, wall-mounted AC, open-plan kitchen with glass backsplash, leather sofa, and a spacious living/dining area. The marble-look coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors that should be checked for child locks. Good natural light from multiple windows and balcony access; the flat layout with no visible stairs is baby-friendly. At 32 ping this is a generous size for a family, though the description is minimal (agent listing) so details on bedrooms and elevator should be confirmed. No red flags from the images — the unit is clean, well-maintained, and move-in ready."}
