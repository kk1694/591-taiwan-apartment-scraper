{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment with high-end finishes, recessed LED lighting, central AC, and sleek built-in cabinetry. Very clean with polished tile floors and open layout with good natural light from large windows. Baby safety considerations: balcony visible through windows should be checked for railing height, furniture has some sharp corners on dining table, but overall spacious flat floor plan is suitable for a family."}
