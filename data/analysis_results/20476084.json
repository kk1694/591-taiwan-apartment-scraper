{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with sleek minimalist design, recessed ceiling AC, light wood laminate flooring, and built-in wooden cabinetry throughout. The spacious 40-ping open-plan living area is exceptionally clean with no visible sharp corners or hazards; floor-to-ceiling windows with curtains provide good natural light. Listed through UR HOUSE (family-friendly foreign rental agency), the 26-story building almost certainly has an elevator; being on the 2nd floor is convenient but the large glass sliding doors to what appears to be a balcony would need child-safety locks once the baby becomes mobile."}
