{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated studio/1-bedroom in Da'an with stylish track lighting, built-in wardrobe, split AC, sleek kitchenette with built-in microwave, and contemporary bathroom with vessel sink. The space is clean and well-finished but quite compact at 13 ping — the kitchen/dining area is narrow and the bedroom appears to be the only main room, which would be tight for a couple with a baby. No visible balcony safety concerns, but natural light seems limited based on the small window visible in the kitchen area; the metal ladder-style shelving in the bedroom could be a climbing hazard for a toddler."}
