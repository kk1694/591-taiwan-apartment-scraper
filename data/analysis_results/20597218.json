{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, empty unfurnished apartment in a newer building with polished tile floors, clean white walls, and good natural light from windows. The unit is on the 8th floor of a 15-story building suggesting elevator access, and includes a dedicated parking space (#10) in a clean underground garage. The spacious open layout with no stairs is baby-friendly, though the unit is completely unfurnished so kitchen, bathroom, and overall livability cannot be fully assessed; the minimal description suggests this is an agent-listed property with very little detail provided."}
