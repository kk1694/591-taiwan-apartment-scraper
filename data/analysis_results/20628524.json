{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Spacious and clean apartment with at least 3 bedrooms (one master, one secondary double, one single/child room), modern tile flooring, AC units in each room, and furnished with basic furniture. The 14-floor building on 2F almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners that would need padding, but floors are smooth tile throughout and the rooms appear to have no stairs or dangerous balcony access visible. Natural light appears moderate with small windows in bedrooms; the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), so kitchen/bathroom condition is unknown."}
