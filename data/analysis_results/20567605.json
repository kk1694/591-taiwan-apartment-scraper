{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, unfurnished apartment with multiple bedrooms, each with built-in wardrobes, AC units, and wallpaper. The kitchen is updated with modern cabinetry and gas stove but the overall style is dated (decorative wallpaper, older light fixtures). At 37 ping in Da'an on floor 2 of a 17-story building, it likely has an elevator. For baby safety, the tile floors are smooth and easy to clean, windows have security grilles, and the flat layout with no visible stairs is good; however the marble-top table in the living room has sharp corners that would need padding. The back service area visible from the kitchen appears cluttered and may need attention."}
