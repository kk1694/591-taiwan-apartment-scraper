{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with traditional Chinese-style furniture and decorative wooden ceiling beams. The space is clean but dated with window AC units instead of modern split systems. Features a balcony with sliding glass doors which may need childproofing; good natural light from large windows. No sharp corners visible but the open floor plan would require baby gates at balcony access points."}
