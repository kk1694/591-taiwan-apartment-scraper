{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an unfurnished apartment with dated decor including patterned wallpaper and old-style chandeliers. The tile floors show significant water staining/discoloration which is a cleanliness concern. The large sliding glass door provides good natural light. For baby safety, the unit appears on ground floor level based on street-view windows, and floors are hard tile which may need rugs. No elevator information visible but exterior shows a modern high-rise building which likely has one."}
