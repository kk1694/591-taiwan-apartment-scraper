{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older style apartment with traditional furnishings, hardwood floors throughout, and decent natural light from multiple windows. The unit appears clean and well-maintained but dated with 1990s-era furniture and fixtures. For baby safety, the exercise bike in the living room would need removal, and the balcony visible in image 1 has standard railings that may need childproofing; no stairs visible which is good for a family with a baby."}
