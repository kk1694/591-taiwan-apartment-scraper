{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious unfurnished apartment with clean walls and light wood laminate flooring throughout. The unit appears well-maintained but dated with older-style fixtures, basic AC units, and simple ceiling lights. For a family with a baby, the flat single-level layout is good, though the large open spaces lack furniture and the kitchen has tile flooring with some visible wear at cabinet edges; no obvious sharp corners or balcony hazards visible but windows would need child-proofing."}
