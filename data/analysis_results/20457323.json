{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern furnished apartment with white tile floors, L-shaped sofa, dining set, TV, AC, and a bed area separated by a shelf divider. The unit is on 5F of a 19-floor building, strongly suggesting elevator access. For baby safety, the open-plan layout with smooth tile floors is generally good, but the coffee table has sharp corners and the shelf room divider could be a climbing hazard; no balcony is visible in these photos. Natural light appears limited, coming mainly from one window area with shutters at the far end. Red flag: the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), providing no real details about the unit, and all 5 photos show only the living room from slightly different angles — no kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom views are provided."}
