{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agency). Living area has polished white tile floors, modern recessed/pendant lighting, and built-in cabinetry; bedrooms feature dark hardwood floors with AC units and walk-in closet. Kitchen is fully fitted with white cabinetry, large Sharp refrigerator, gas stove, and range hood. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors in the living area could be slippery and the hard corners on the TV console/cabinets would need padding; however, the flat single-level layout with no visible stairs is a plus. Natural light appears moderate with windows visible in the bedroom; the listing description is minimal (just an agent promo) so layout details and floor number should be confirmed."}
