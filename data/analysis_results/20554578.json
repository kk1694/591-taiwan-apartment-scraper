{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment with minimalist design, polished tile floors, and contemporary furniture. Good natural light from large windows. The balcony area has security bars which is good for baby safety, though the laundry area with exposed gas meter and pipes should be kept restricted. No visible stairs or sharp corners in living areas; single-level layout appears safe for a crawling baby."}
