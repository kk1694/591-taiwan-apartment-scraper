{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern apartment with high-end finishes including built-in cabinetry, modern kitchen with integrated appliances, and recessed lighting throughout. Good natural light from large windows in bedrooms with balcony access. For baby safety, the balconies have standard railings that would need childproofing, and the tile floors are hard surfaces - no major red flags but typical precautions needed. The unit is unfurnished and very clean."}
