{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older Taiwan apartment with dated furniture and fixtures from the 1990s-2000s era - wooden cabinets, older AC units, and traditional marble coffee table. The space appears clean and spacious with decent natural light from windows with security bars. For baby safety: the windows have protective railings, floors are flat tile without stairs, but the glass coffee table and heavy wooden furniture could pose bumping hazards. The bathroom shows some wear with an older bathtub that would need supervision with a baby."}
