{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Older-style apartment (likely 15-20 years old) with dated wood-tone built-in cabinetry and crown molding, but in clean and well-maintained condition. The living area has smooth tile floors, good natural light from sliding glass balcony doors, AC, a separate galley kitchen with gas stove and large fridge, and a rear utility balcony with water heater. Bedroom has hardwood flooring and large windows with blinds. For baby safety, the balcony with railing on the 11th floor needs child-proofing, and the washing machine placed oddly in the living room could be a concern; the tile-to-wood floor transitions have low dark trim edges that a crawling baby could trip on. Overall a spacious, reasonably clean unit but the decor is dated and the description is essentially blank (just a generic agent promo), which is a minor red flag suggesting a less attentive listing."}
