{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern unfurnished apartment in excellent clean condition with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and wall-mounted AC units. The 5th floor unit in an 11-story building almost certainly has an elevator. Good natural light through large windows with modern black frames; no visible balconies which is positive for baby safety, and no stairs or sharp architectural features visible. The empty rooms provide a blank canvas for baby-proofing."}
