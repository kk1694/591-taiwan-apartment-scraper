{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern bathroom fixtures, recessed lighting, and central air conditioning. The unit has multiple bedrooms (at least 3 based on images), clean tile floors, and built-in storage. For baby safety: no visible balconies or stairs in photos, furniture has some sharp corners on the wooden sets that would need padding; the glass shower door and low window sills in bedrooms would need childproofing. Natural light is limited due to small windows facing what appears to be an airshaft or neighboring building."}
