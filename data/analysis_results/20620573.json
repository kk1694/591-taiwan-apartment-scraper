{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with minimalist design, LED accent lighting, and high-quality finishes throughout. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with rounded furniture (sofa, coffee table) that is relatively baby-safe; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings in images. Natural light appears limited with small windows and blackout blinds, though recessed lighting compensates well. At 25 ping with at least 2 bedrooms visible, this is spacious for Da'an district."}
