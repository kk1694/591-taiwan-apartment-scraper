{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed lighting, large marble-look floor tiles, and a quality leather sofa. The building has an elevator (clearly visible in lobby photo) and an upscale lobby with communal lounge and library/co-working space. The living area appears spacious and baby-friendly with smooth floors, no visible sharp corners, and large windows providing good natural light; however, only common areas and living room are shown — no bedroom, kitchen, or bathroom photos, which is a minor red flag for a 29-ping unit at NT$52K."}
