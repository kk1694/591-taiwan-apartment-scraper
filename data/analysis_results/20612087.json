{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxury high-rise building with rooftop pool, upscale lounge, and modern gym amenities. The unit itself appears to be a small studio with dated decorative furniture style (teal/cream vanity), built-in wardrobes, AC, and digital door lock. No visible windows in unit photos raises concern about natural light; the space appears cramped for a family with baby. Building amenities are excellent but the unit size at 13 ping is quite small for a growing family."}
