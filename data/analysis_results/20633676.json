{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 39-ping apartment in Songshan with hardwood floors, large living room with L-shaped sofa, and a functional kitchen with gas stove and dish dryer. The unit appears clean but dated with older-style furnishings and decor; the coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the top floor (7F/7F) raises concerns about potential roof leaks and summer heat. Good natural light from large curtained windows in the living area, and the listing is managed by HOYUAN Real Estate Agency which caters to foreign tenants."}
