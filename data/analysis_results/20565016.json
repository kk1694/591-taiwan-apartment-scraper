{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with hardwood floors, leather sofas, piano, and a large dining area with built-in wooden cabinets. The unit is clean and well-maintained but has dated fixtures including old-style ceiling lights and curtains. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings visible through sliding glass doors that should be checked for gap width; the glass-front cabinet and sharp-cornered coffee table would need childproofing. Natural light is moderate from the balcony windows but the unit appears somewhat dim overall. At 37 ping on the 8th floor of a 17-story building, an elevator is very likely present."}
