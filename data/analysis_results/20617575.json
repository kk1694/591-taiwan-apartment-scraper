{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious unfurnished apartment with older-style wood cabinetry and fixtures that appear dated (1980s-90s era). The apartment is clean with light wood laminate flooring and good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the open floor plan is positive with no visible stairs, but the balcony access through floor-to-ceiling windows would need childproofing; exposed electrical cords visible in one image are a concern."}
