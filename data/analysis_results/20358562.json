{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including light wood flooring, recessed lighting, and stylish pendant lights. The spacious open layout with no stairs is good for baby safety, though the balcony visible in images would need childproofing. Kitchen is modern with white cabinetry, dishwasher, and new appliances. Good natural light from large windows. The unit appears unfurnished and move-in ready."}
