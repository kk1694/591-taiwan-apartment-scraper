{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, clean modern apartment with white tile floors, red leather sofas, a well-equipped galley kitchen with gas stove, microwave, and full-size fridge. The unit is on floor 11 of 14, strongly suggesting elevator access. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery; the coffee table and TV stand have sharp corners that would need padding; windows appear to have adequate railings but no visible balcony hazards. Good natural light from large windows, and the open layout provides plenty of room for a growing family. Listed through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency, which caters to foreign tenants."}
