{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a modern, spacious unit with recessed lighting, central AC, video intercom, and a high-end kitchen with built-in oven and wine cooler. However, the space looks more like a commercial office than a residential apartment - note the floor power outlets, glass partition walls, and lack of bedroom/bathroom photos. The unit is unfurnished and very clean, but families with a baby should clarify if this is truly residential and request to see bathroom and bedroom areas."}
