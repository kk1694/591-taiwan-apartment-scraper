{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with clean white cabinetry, recessed ceiling AC, gas stove kitchen, and light wood-tone flooring throughout. Has a master bedroom and a very small second room (single bed only) which could work as a nursery. The space is compact but clean with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access; however, natural light appears limited as all windows have blinds drawn and photos suggest interior-facing rooms. The small kitchen fridge and limited counter space may be a constraint for a growing family."}
