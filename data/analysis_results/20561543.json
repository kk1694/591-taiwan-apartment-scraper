{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment in Da'an with dated furnishings, old-style window AC units, dark wood entertainment center, and a worn kitchen with aging cabinets and basic fixtures. The apartment has multiple rooms with decent natural light from windows with security grilles, but the overall condition is tired and not recently renovated. For a baby, the low futon-style sofas reduce fall risk, but the older kitchen has exposed pipes and cluttered counters; the 2F walk-up in a 4-story building almost certainly has no elevator, which would be challenging with a stroller."}
