{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, beautifully renovated apartment with modern white cabinetry, recessed lighting, textured accent wall, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. The unit appears very clean with smooth polished floors that could be slippery for a crawling baby, but no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings. At 9F/11F in a modern building, an elevator is highly likely."}
