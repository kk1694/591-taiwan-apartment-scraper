{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment with bright white finishes, recessed lighting, and updated kitchen with induction cooktop and dishwasher. The glass coffee table has sharp edges that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony has standard metal railings that may require child safety gates once mobile. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows, and all single-level layout is ideal for baby safety."}
