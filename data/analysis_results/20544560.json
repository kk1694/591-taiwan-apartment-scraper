{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Brand new modern apartment in a newly constructed 15-floor building with rooftop garden. Interior is very clean with marble-look tile flooring, modern kitchen with induction cooktop, glossy white cabinets, and new furniture. The balcony has metal railings with decorative grillwork which is good for baby safety, though the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. Good natural light from the balcony windows. The building appears high-quality with a landscaped rooftop terrace. No red flags; excellent condition overall."}
