{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, AC, updated kitchen with Panasonic fridge and front-loading washer. Listed by Elegant Realty (expat housing agent). At least 2 bedrooms (master with accent wall, smaller room suitable as nursery/study). The smaller room could work well as a baby room. Smooth tile floors and rounded wooden furniture reduce sharp-corner risks; windows have security bars which are good for child safety. Good natural light in living room and master bedroom from large windows. No visible balcony access concerns. Floor 10/15 strongly suggests elevator building."}
