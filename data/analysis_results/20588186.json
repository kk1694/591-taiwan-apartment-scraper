{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, recently renovated unfurnished apartment with polished tile floors, modern AC units, and dark-framed windows with curtains in every room. The 9-story building on 2F almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the tile floors are slippery, the low windows in the bedrooms could be a concern once the child is mobile, and exposed electrical outlets near the floor would need covers; no balcony railings or stairs are visible. Good natural light from multiple windows with greenery outside, and the spacious ~40 ping layout offers plenty of room, though the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request full details on layout and amenities directly."}
