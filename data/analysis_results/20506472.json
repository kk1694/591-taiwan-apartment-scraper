{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment (42 ping) in Da'an with partially renovated interiors — modern pendant lights and track lighting but older-style stainless steel kitchen cabinets, exposed pipes, and a dated gas stove setup. The space is very open and spacious with multiple rooms visible, decent natural light from balcony-facing windows, and clean light-colored flooring throughout. For baby safety, the balcony area with sliding doors needs childproofing, the kitchen has an open gas stove at child-reachable height, and the largely empty hard-floor space has sharp wall corners; being on the 5th floor of a 6-story walkup (likely no elevator) is a significant concern for stroller access. Listed through UR HOUSE rental agency; the listing description is essentially empty (just an ad for agent services), which is a minor red flag."}
