{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in very clean condition with modern light wood laminate flooring, track lighting, split AC, and built-in cabinetry throughout. The unit has good natural light from large windows with sheer curtains, and the bedrooms feature cozy built-in window seats with storage. For baby safety, the window seat areas in the bedrooms sit at a height that a toddler could climb, so window locks should be verified; the balcony appears to have floor-to-ceiling railing/grating which is positive, and the interior has no visible stairs or sharp corners. At 27 ping on the 5th floor of a 9-story building (likely has elevator), this is a spacious, move-in-ready unfurnished unit well-suited for a young family."}
