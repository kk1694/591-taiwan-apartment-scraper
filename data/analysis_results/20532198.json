{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including hardwood floors, recessed lighting, and a renovated kitchen with sleek two-tone cabinetry. Good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the glass cabinet in the dining area and any low shelving would need childproofing, but the open floor plan is spacious with no visible stairs; the kitchen has a balcony area that would need a secure gate."}
