{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern studio apartment in excellent condition with clean minimalist finishes, recessed lighting, modern AC units, and a sleek kitchenette with induction cooktop and LG fridge. The balcony has glass railings which are a baby safety concern as a child could climb furniture near the sliding doors to access it; the sliding glass doors to the balcony should be secured. At 12 ping this is a compact open-plan studio (bed, sofa, and kitchen in one space) which will be very tight for a couple with a baby, and there is no visible separate bedroom for a crib."}
