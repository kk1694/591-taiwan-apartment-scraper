{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin", "notes": "Very spacious older apartment (54 ping) in a luxury-style community with a swimming pool and tropical landscaping. The interior has hardwood floors, crystal chandeliers, and wall-mounted AC units but has a dated 1990s aesthetic with crown molding and older fixtures; the unit is mostly unfurnished. For baby safety, the large open floor plan with exposed structural columns has sharp corners that would need padding, and the balcony sliding doors require childproofing; the large windows provide good natural light. Being on the 4th of 5 floors with no elevator confirmed could be challenging with a stroller and baby gear."}
