{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older renovated apartment with parquet wood flooring, open-plan kitchen with subway tile backsplash and bar counter, frosted glass French doors between rooms, and AC units. The building is a low-rise walkup (2F/4F) likely without elevator, and the glass-paneled doors and kitchen shelving with sharp edges could pose baby safety concerns. Natural light appears limited (frosted/barred windows suggest facing close neighbors), and the unit is mostly unfurnished with a somewhat dated but clean condition."}
