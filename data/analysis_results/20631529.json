{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Luxurious, high-end modern apartment with designer herringbone hardwood flooring, recessed lighting, stone accent TV wall, open-plan kitchen with island dining, and sleek dark wood paneling throughout. The unit is very spacious at 67.79 ping with excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the hard wood floors and sharp-edged kitchen island/dining furniture would need padding; the large windows appear to have proper railings but balcony access should be verified. An 11-story building on the 4th floor almost certainly has an elevator. Very clean and well-maintained but the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag — confirm details directly with the agent."}
