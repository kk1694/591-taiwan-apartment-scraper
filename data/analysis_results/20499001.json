{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, polished tile floors, built-in wardrobes, and central AC. The balcony has glass railings which are a safety concern for a baby/toddler - these would need child-proofing. Good natural light through large windows, very clean and newly finished. No stairs visible, single-level layout appears baby-friendly aside from balcony access."}
