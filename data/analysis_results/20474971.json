{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylish loft-style apartment with high ceilings, modern industrial-chic design featuring wood laminate flooring, an open-plan kitchen with bar island, and a spacious living area with large sectional sofa. The kitchen has a gas stove and the space appears clean and well-maintained. Baby safety concerns include the metal bar stools at the kitchen island, potentially sharp corners on the industrial-style metal dining chairs, and what appears to be a mezzanine/loft level with stairs visible in the background which would need gating. Good natural light from tall windows with wooden blinds."}
