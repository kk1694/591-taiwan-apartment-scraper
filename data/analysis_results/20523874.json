{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern minimalist design, featuring new wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, sleek kitchen cabinetry with black fixtures, and a modern bathroom with marble-look tiles. Clean and well-maintained condition with good staging. For baby safety, the open floor plan is generally safe with no visible stairs or dangerous balconies, though the glass coffee table edges and low TV stand corners may need baby-proofing. Natural light appears limited based on photos shown."}
