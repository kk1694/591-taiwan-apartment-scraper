{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed LED lighting, light wood laminate flooring, modern built-in cabinetry, and a split AC unit. The balcony has horizontal railing bars visible through large sliding glass doors, which would need baby-proofing; the platform bed has sharp corners that could be a concern for a crawling baby. The unit appears very clean with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows, though only 4 photos were provided and no kitchen or bathroom is shown — worth requesting more details. Being on the 4th floor of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
