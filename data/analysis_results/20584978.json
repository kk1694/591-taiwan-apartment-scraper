{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with clean wood-tone built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, and contemporary finishes throughout. The unit has at least 2 bedrooms (one with a double bed and vanity, one smaller room suitable as a nursery), a spacious living room with leather sofa, and a well-equipped open kitchen with dining area. For baby safety, the second bedroom has a floor-level mattress which is ideal; no visible dangerous stairs or balcony railings, though sharp corners on the TV console and dining table would need padding. Listed through UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a foreigner-friendly rental agency, which is a plus. The 16-story building on floor 5 very likely has an elevator. Natural light appears moderate with zebra blinds on all windows. Overall clean and move-in ready."}
