{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a multi-room unit with modern laminate flooring, AC units, and quality appliances including both a top-loader and front-loading washer. The space shows 3 different bedroom areas which is unusual - may be subdivided units or a shared house arrangement. For baby safety, the open shelving in one room and raised bed platforms could be concerns; natural light appears limited (beach mural suggests no real window in that room). Being on 1F of a 5F building, no elevator needed but ground floor access is convenient for stroller."}
