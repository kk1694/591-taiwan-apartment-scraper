{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, built-in central AC, and contemporary furnishings. Spacious open living/dining area with a separate enclosed kitchen visible in the background. The bedroom is large with wood flooring, en-suite bathroom, and good natural light from corner windows. At 58 ping this is very spacious for a family. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass sliding doors that appear secure, and the flat layout with no stairs is ideal; the tile floors in living areas are hard so rugs would be recommended for a crawling baby. The unit appears to be in a newer building (5F/9F suggests an elevator building) and is in excellent, move-in ready condition with quality finishes throughout."}
