{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/office space or former storefront rather than a residential apartment. The space has mixed construction quality - some areas have metal sheet roofing/walls with exposed pipes and a gas tank (images 2-3), while other areas show decorative wainscoting and herringbone floors (images 4-5). Significant concerns include water damage/mold visible below the window grating, industrial-style construction with corrugated metal walls, stairs without railings posing major baby safety risks, and the overall layout appears designed for commercial use rather than family living."}
