{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, high-end studio apartment in a newer building with recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, concealed AC, and a well-finished bathroom with glass shower partition and modern tankless toilet. The open-plan layout is spacious but appears to be a single-room studio with bed in the main living area, which may feel cramped for a couple with a baby. There is a balcony with a sliding glass door that would need childproofing; the slippery polished tile floors are a concern for a crawling baby, and no kitchen is visible in the photos, which is a significant drawback for a family with an infant."}
