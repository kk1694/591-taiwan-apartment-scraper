{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, new-construction apartment in excellent condition with clean white walls, wood-look tile flooring, track lighting, glass sliding partition, modern kitchenette with glass backsplash, and split-type AC units in multiple rooms. The balcony has metal railings with narrow gaps visible through the sliding glass door, which is reasonably safe but should be verified in person for baby safety; no stairs or sharp corners observed. Excellent natural light from large windows on the 8th floor with mountain views; the unit appears mostly unfurnished which is a plus for customizing a baby-friendly space, though the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only) which is a minor red flag — confirm actual room count and amenities directly."}
