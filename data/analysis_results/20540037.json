{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, central AC vents, and light wood-tone laminate flooring throughout. The kitchen features a gas stovetop, built-in oven/microwave, and glass backsplash. The entryway has a custom shoe cabinet with hexagonal tile flooring. For baby safety, the open kitchen with gas stove is a concern, and the balcony area visible through the glass door should be checked for railing height; however, the flat layout with no stairs is a plus. Natural light appears limited based on the photos — windows with security grilles are visible but rooms look mostly artificially lit. The listing description is minimal (agent promotional text only), providing no useful details about the property itself, which is a minor red flag."}
