{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "This is a brand-new or recently renovated luxury apartment in a high-end building with an opulent lobby featuring crystal chandeliers, marble floors, and a designer lounge area, plus a rooftop garden terrace. The unit itself has modern wood-laminate flooring, a new digital door lock, split AC, and new furniture still in protective wrapping. For baby safety, the unit appears to be a clean open layout with no visible stairs or sharp corners, though the rooftop terrace common area would need supervision; the 9th floor location with elevator access is convenient for stroller use."}
