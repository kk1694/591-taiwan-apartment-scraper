{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern European-style decor featuring leather sofas, glass-top coffee table, open-plan kitchen with gas stove, range hood, full-size fridge, and a dining area with ornate decorative screen divider. The glass coffee table and glass dining table have sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the ornate lattice screen has openings a toddler could reach through. The apartment appears clean with good lighting from large floor-to-ceiling windows with a balcony; at 51 ping on the 4th floor of a 13-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator, and the size is very generous for a growing family."}
