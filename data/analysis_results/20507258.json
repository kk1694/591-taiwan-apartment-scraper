{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District, near a small neighborhood park with playground", "notes": "Spacious 36-ping apartment in good modern condition with recessed LED lighting, leather sofa, glass sliding doors, built-in cabinetry, and polished tile floors throughout. The living room is large and clean with ceiling-mounted AC; the bedroom has an en-suite bathroom and fitted bed area; the kitchen is a separate galley-style with induction cooktop, range hood, and full-size fridge. For baby safety, the glass sliding doors between rooms have floor-level tracks that could be a tripping hazard, and the coffee table has sharp corners; no balcony or stairs are visible which is positive. The building is 12 floors (unit on 6F) strongly suggesting elevator access, and the nearby park with a playground visible in image 1 is a nice bonus for a young family. The listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and lease terms."}
