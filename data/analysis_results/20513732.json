{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern loft-style apartment with double-height ceilings, contemporary industrial lighting fixtures, and light wood laminate flooring in excellent condition. The unit has a spacious balcony with glass sliding doors providing good natural light. For baby safety, the balcony railing appears adequate but parents should verify the balcony door locks securely; the open loft design likely includes internal stairs which would need baby gates."}
