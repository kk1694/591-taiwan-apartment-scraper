{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Very spacious and clean apartment (77.76 ping) with modern finishes including polished tile floors, wall-mounted AC units, flat-screen TV, and a nicely tiled bathroom with bathtub. The balcony has metal railings with horizontal bars that could be a climbing hazard for a toddler and would need baby-proofing; the bathtub also requires supervision. The unit is mostly unfurnished with plenty of open floor space, good natural light from large windows, and appears to be in a well-maintained high-rise building in Datong District — the 15-floor building almost certainly has an elevator."}
