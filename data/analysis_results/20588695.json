{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Well-maintained older-style apartment on 11F with built-in wood cabinetry and crown molding giving a dated but clean appearance. Good natural light from large sliding glass balcony doors and bedroom windows with mountain views; the balcony has solid concrete railings which are safer for a baby, though the sliding doors to the balcony would need child locks. Kitchen is compact but functional with gas stove, range hood, fridge, and rear utility balcony; floors are smooth polished tile throughout with dark baseboards creating minor sharp edges at corners."}
