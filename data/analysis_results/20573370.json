{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern duplex/loft apartment with an open staircase leading to an upper level - a significant safety hazard for a baby as the stairs have no gates and wide gaps between steps. The unit features stylish marble accent walls, built-in cabinetry, split AC units, and good storage space. While clean and well-maintained with two bedrooms, the internal staircase and glass railings near the loft area pose concerns for child safety."}
