{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed lighting, polished tile floors, and contemporary furnishings. The living room has a sliding glass door to a balcony and the bedroom features large windows with good natural light and built-in wardrobes. The glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners which is a baby safety concern, and the balcony access would need childproofing. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agent), the unit appears clean and move-in ready at 29 ping on the 9th floor of an 18-story building, which almost certainly has an elevator."}
