{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large 1F unit with dated but well-maintained finishes including older wall-mounted AC units, window-style AC, and classic tile floors. The open layout is spacious with good natural light from French doors. For baby safety, the ground floor means no stairs but the metal-leg sofas have sharp corners, and the balcony area visible has low railings that would need childproofing. Kitchen is fully equipped but appliances appear older."}
