{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment managed by UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly rental service) with stylish track lighting, designer dining area, spacious living room with large sectional sofa, and at least 3 bedrooms including a master with bay window. The apartment appears very clean with modern AC units in every room, light wood flooring, and a minimalist aesthetic. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is a plus, but the open wardrobe with metal frame in the bedroom and the low coffee table edges could be concerns; no balcony railings are visible in the photos, and the large windows appear to have proper curtains. Good natural light from multiple windows on a high floor (11F). Da'an district location is excellent. Note: the listing description is minimal (just a promotional ad), so kitchen and bathroom conditions are unknown."}
