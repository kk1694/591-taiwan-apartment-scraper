{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes, LED accent lighting, wood-look flooring, and designer furniture. Very clean and well-maintained with a minimalist aesthetic. For baby safety: the space has rounded furniture with no sharp corners visible, no stairs, and the open layout is good for supervision, though the small dining area chairs may need attention. Natural light appears limited based on the photos but recessed lighting is excellent."}
