{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with sleek finishes including recessed ceiling AC, LED lighting, textured stone-look wall panels, sliding closet doors, and clean tile flooring. The building is 18 floors and the unit is on the 5th floor, strongly suggesting elevator access. For baby safety, the living area appears open and relatively safe with rounded coffee table edges, though the low TV console and glass-top coffee table could be concerns; no visible balcony or stairs in the photos. The space looks clean and well-maintained but the images only show the living room area — no kitchen, bathroom, or bedrooms visible, and the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag for transparency."}
