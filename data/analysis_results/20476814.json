{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious well-maintained apartment with polished hardwood floors throughout, recessed lighting, air conditioning, and modern kitchen cabinetry. The open floor plan with large living/dining area and ample natural light from multiple windows is good for families. The coffee table has sharp corners and the balcony visible in image 4 would need child-proofing, but overall the unit appears clean and in good condition with plenty of storage in the bedroom."}
