{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a newly renovated building with a luxurious lobby (image 1 shows marble floors, designer chandelier, modern furniture). The individual units shown (images 2-5) are small studio-style rooms with new white cabinetry, glass backsplash kitchenette, marble-look tile floors, AC, and compact bathroom — very clean but quite compact for a couple with a baby despite the 19.45 ping listing (the images suggest this may be subdivided into multiple small units). No windows are visible in the unit photos which is a red flag for natural light and ventilation; the 5th floor with no confirmed elevator in unit photos (though the upscale lobby suggests one) and the small space with hard tile floors are minor baby safety concerns."}
