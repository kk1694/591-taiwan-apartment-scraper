{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with clean finishes, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, wall-mounted AC, and a fully equipped kitchen with gas stove and microwave. The space is bright and minimalist with smooth tile flooring. For baby safety, the open layout has few hazards but the piano and open shelving could need childproofing; no visible balcony railings or stairs in images. Being on 4F/14F strongly suggests elevator access."}
