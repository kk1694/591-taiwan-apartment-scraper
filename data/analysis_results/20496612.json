{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, newly renovated unfurnished apartment with shiny tile floors, open-plan living with kitchen, and multiple bedrooms with excellent natural light from large windows. The unit appears very clean with no visible safety hazards; floors are smooth without steps, corners are rounded, and no dangerous balcony access is visible. Kitchen cabinetry still has protective film indicating brand new condition. Being on floor 8 of 15, an elevator is highly likely."}
