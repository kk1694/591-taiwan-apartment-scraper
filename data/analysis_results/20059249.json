{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated finishes — the bedroom has tiled walls with visible staining/mold, a pink rubber floor, and a wooden ceiling panel suggesting a converted or repurposed space (possibly a former kitchen or wet area). The living room is clean but basic with fluorescent tube lighting, tile floors, and no visible windows except a small barred frosted-glass window in a side room, raising concerns about limited natural light and ventilation. For a baby, the hard tile floors throughout, the metal bed frame with sharp corners, and the lack of visible balcony safety features are concerns; the 2F walkup with no elevator would also be difficult with a stroller."}
