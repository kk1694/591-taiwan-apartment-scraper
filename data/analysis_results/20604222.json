{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment in Da'an with a furnished living room, two bedrooms with hardwood floors, recessed and cove lighting, AC units, and decent natural light from large windows. The living area has tile floors and modern furniture, though the coffee table has sharp marble corners that would need baby-proofing; no visible balcony concerns. One small room (image 5) shows a dirty/damaged mattress on dark flooring which is a cleanliness red flag — confirm whether this will be cleaned or removed before move-in. At 4F of a 12-floor building, an elevator is very likely present."}
