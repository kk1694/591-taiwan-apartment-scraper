{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with recessed lighting, split AC units, quality leather sofa, and fully equipped kitchen with modern appliances. The unit appears to be a duplex or loft style with internal stairs visible, which poses a safety concern for a crawling baby or toddler. Glass coffee table with sharp corners also requires attention. Good natural light from large windows, very clean condition overall."}
