{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Beitou hillside area", "notes": "This is a multi-story townhouse/villa on a hillside in Beitou with a modern renovation featuring polished tile floors, recessed LED lighting, ceiling fans, and a dark-toned kitchen. The staircase with metal railings is a significant baby safety concern — gaps in the railing could be hazardous and stairs would need gating. The hilltop view photo suggests a remote mountainside location which may be inconvenient for daily errands and hospital access. The unit is unfurnished and very spacious at 90 ping, but being a multi-level house rather than a flat apartment, it is less ideal for a couple with a baby."}
