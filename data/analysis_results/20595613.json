{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "This is an older, dated apartment with visible wall staining/water damage, old-style window AC units, worn wooden wardrobes, and aging vinyl flooring. The unit has multiple rooms (at least 3 bedrooms) with balcony access and decent natural light on the 11th floor. For a baby, the balcony railings appear adequate but the overall condition is poor — water stains on walls suggest moisture issues, the bathroom visible through the doorway looks very basic, and the unit would need significant cleaning and updating. At NT$53,000/month for this condition in Da'an, this is overpriced."}
