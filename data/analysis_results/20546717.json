Very baby-friendly community with dedicated children's play area, parent-child reading room, and modern elevator access. The unit comes furnished and recently renovated for first-hand occupancy. Note: floor-to-ceiling windows and terraces require childproofing for baby safety; NT$2,060/month management fee is additional; no pets allowed. Overall an excellent option for a couple expecting a baby given the family-oriented community amenities."}
