{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, clean tile floors, built-in wooden cabinetry, and a wall-mounted AC unit. The living area is very large with a tufted sofa, marble coffee table, and ample open floor space which is great for a baby to crawl. The enclosed balcony has sturdy iron grillwork on the windows providing good safety; the marble-topped coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding for baby safety. Natural light is good from the large window wall. At 4F/14F the building very likely has an elevator. Overall a clean, upscale unit in Da'an with no major red flags."}
