{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, luxurious studio with high-end finishes including marble accents, wood paneling, LED strip lighting, smart toilet, and stylish fixtures. Glass coffee table has sharp corners and glass partition poses potential hazards for a crawling baby. Being on the 8th/8th floor (top floor) with no visible elevator confirmation is a concern. Space is compact but immaculately clean with good natural light from large windows."}
