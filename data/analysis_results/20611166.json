{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment with polished hardwood floors but dated decor from the 1990s-2000s era, featuring older style AC units and crystal chandeliers. The open floor plan is good for baby visibility, with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings, though the large unfurnished space would need corner guards on furniture once furnished. Natural light appears limited with frosted windows visible, and the walls show some wear marks."}
