{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern wood flooring, stylish living room with leather sofa, and a renovated bathroom with marble-style tiles and bathtub. The building entrance shows a proper lobby with security door, suggesting a managed building with elevator (12-story building at 5F). For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need padding, and the bathtub lacks a non-slip mat; the open shelving unit could be a climbing hazard for a toddler. Overall the unit is clean, spacious at 33.58 ping, and appears to get decent natural light from windows visible in the bedroom and living area."}
