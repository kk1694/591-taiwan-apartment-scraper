{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Shuangyuan, Wanhua District (near Kid Castle English School)", "notes": "This is a commercial/office space, NOT a residential apartment. The exterior shows a Kid Castle English school storefront, and the interior is a large, empty open-plan commercial floor with drop ceiling, fluorescent lighting, concrete pillars, and no windows or natural light. Completely unsuitable for a couple expecting a baby — no kitchen, no bathroom fixtures visible, no residential layout, and the basement-like environment has no natural ventilation or light."}
