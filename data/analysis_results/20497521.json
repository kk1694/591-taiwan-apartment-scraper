{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean, all-white furnished apartment with recessed LED ceiling lighting, AC, washing machine, microwave, fridge, TV, and a small kitchenette. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and the open layout with slippery tile floors are minor baby safety concerns; the bedroom area is separated by a curtain partition rather than a wall. Good natural light from large windows, very clean condition, but the listing appears to show multiple similar units (slightly different layouts across photos), which is a mild red flag suggesting this may be an agent listing multiple properties under one ad."}
