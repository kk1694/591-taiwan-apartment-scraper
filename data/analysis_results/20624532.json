{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with modern fixtures including open-concept kitchen with stainless steel appliances, sleek cabinetry, and contemporary lighting. The space appears clean with good artificial lighting, though natural light seems limited in photos. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners and the marble/stone surfaces would need childproofing; the living space has an open layout which is good for supervision. Two beds visible in bedroom suggest good space for a family."}
