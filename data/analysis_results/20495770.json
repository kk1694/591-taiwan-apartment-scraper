{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained modern apartment with open-plan living/dining/kitchen area, built-in cabinetry, induction cooktop, AC, and large windows providing excellent natural light with city views from the 8th floor. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, but the overall layout is open and flat with no visible stairs, which is good for a crawling baby. Being on the top floor (8F/8F) is a concern for potential roof leaks and heat, and the listing description is minimal (just a broker ad template with no real details), which is a minor red flag."}
