{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a well-maintained duplex apartment with modern finishes, recessed lighting, and ample built-in storage. Baby safety concern: the interior staircase leading to the upper floor has glass railings that may require a baby gate; the hardwood floors upstairs could be slippery. Good natural light from large curved windows in the bedroom, and the unit appears clean with contemporary fixtures."}
