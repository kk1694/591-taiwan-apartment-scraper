{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern apartment with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and large panoramic windows offering excellent natural light and city views. The space appears very clean with built-in cabinetry and marble accent walls. Glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing; the low window sills and floor-to-ceiling windows may pose safety concerns for a crawling/toddling child. Being on 7F/7F (top floor), elevator status is uncertain but likely given the building quality."}
