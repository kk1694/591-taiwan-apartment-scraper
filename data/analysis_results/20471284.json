{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with light wood-tone flooring, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture throughout. At least 3 bedrooms visible plus a dining area; the living room has a balcony with sliding doors. The glass coffee table with sharp corners and the balcony access are baby safety concerns, but the unit is spacious at 51 ping with clean finishes. The 13-story building on floor 3 almost certainly has an elevator, and the description is minimal (agent listing), so further details should be confirmed directly."}
