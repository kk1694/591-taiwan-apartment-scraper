{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment (66 ping) in a 15-story building with clean tile floors, multiple AC units, and en-suite bathroom visible. The first staged photo appears to be a virtual staging or sample image that differs from the actual empty unit shown in photos 2-5, which is a red flag. The unit has sliding glass balcony doors and windows with screens but no visible balcony railing details; the hard tile floors throughout would need rugs/mats for baby crawling safety. The space is very bare and dated with dark wood trim baseboards, and would require full furnishing."}
