{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious apartment with dated but well-maintained wooden fixtures and tile flooring throughout. The furniture style is older Taiwanese (1990s-2000s) but clean. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners and elevated wooden platform in the bedroom are potential concerns. The apartment appears to have at least 2 bedrooms with decent natural light from windows, though no balcony is visible in these images."}
