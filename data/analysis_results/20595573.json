{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with high-quality built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, central AC, and a fully equipped kitchen with gas stove and built-in appliances. The unit is spacious at 27 ping with multiple rooms including a master bedroom with large windows providing good natural light, a smaller interior bedroom (potential nursery but no window visible), and a study/living area with massage chair. Being on 4F/4F (top floor) with no elevator info, carrying a stroller could be a concern; the smaller bedroom lacks natural light, and some open shelving and sharp desk corners would need baby-proofing."}
