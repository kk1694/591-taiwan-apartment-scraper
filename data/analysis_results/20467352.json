{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern white cabinetry, light wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, and a stylish green accent wall. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with a glass sliding door separating rooms, built-in wardrobes, and a kitchen area with windows providing decent natural light. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedrooms have low sills that would need childproofing, but overall the flat open layout with no stairs is favorable; the 9th floor location on a 10-floor building without confirmed elevator could be a concern."}
