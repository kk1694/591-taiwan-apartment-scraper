{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "This appears to be a commercial or office space rather than a residential apartment. The space is completely empty with exposed concrete ceilings, industrial track lighting, exposed brick accents, and no kitchen or bathroom fixtures visible. The layout resembles a loft-style office or studio space, not a family home. Not suitable for a couple with a baby — there are no residential amenities, the exposed brick and concrete suggest an unfinished commercial conversion, and the open industrial design with visible wiring and piping raises safety concerns for a child."}
