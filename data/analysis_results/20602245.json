{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with hardwood floors, exposed wooden ceiling beams, and skylights providing excellent natural light. The living area appears clean with children's toys (toy car, stroller) already present suggesting family-friendly use. Baby safety concerns include the low window/balcony railing visible in living room and industrial-style coffee table with metal frame; bedroom appears windowless or has minimal natural light. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a baby."}
