{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern, well-maintained loft-style apartment with double-height ceilings in the living area, clean white/light wood finishes, and polished tile floors. The bedroom appears to be on a mezzanine/loft level with low ceilings and recessed lighting. The kitchen is very compact with an LG washer-dryer, induction cooktop, and small sink — functional but tight for a family. Baby safety concerns include the loft-style layout which likely has internal stairs and a railing/drop hazard from the upper level, and the glass sliding doors in the kitchen area. Natural light comes through tall floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room with a balcony, though only 5 images were shown and no balcony closeup is visible. Overall clean and modern but the loft stairs and limited kitchen space may be challenging for a couple with a baby."}
