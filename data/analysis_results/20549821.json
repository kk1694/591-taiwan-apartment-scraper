{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very stylish, boutique-hotel-style apartment with high-end wood paneling, LED accent lighting, marble feature wall, modern chandelier, and built-in storage behind slatted wood panels. The unit appears to be a loft or duplex on the top floor (8F/8F) with internal stairs visible behind the wood slat wall — this is a significant baby safety concern as the staircase has only a thin rope handrail and open slats a child could slip through. The glass coffee table in the living room also poses a risk. Natural light comes from large windows but may be limited on one side due to proximity to neighboring buildings."}
