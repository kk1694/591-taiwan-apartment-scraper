{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean but dated apartment with older-style fixtures and decorative ceiling panels. The bunk beds in the small bedroom have safety rails which is good, but the room is quite cramped. Living area has decent natural light from windows but no balcony visible. Overall well-maintained but not modern, with tile floors throughout most areas making it easy to clean for a baby."}
