{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment in clean condition with split-system AC units in multiple rooms, tile flooring, and contemporary furniture. The unit appears to be a multi-room flat with separate bedrooms and living/dining areas. For baby safety, the space has minimal sharp corners and no visible balconies or stairs in the photos, though the rooms appear somewhat cramped and lack natural light as no windows are visible in most photos (only curtained windows in one bedroom)."}
