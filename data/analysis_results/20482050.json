{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Older-style unfurnished apartment in clean but dated condition with yellowed AC units, arched doorway details, and basic tile/wood flooring from the 1990s-2000s era. The living room has a balcony with sliding doors and metal railings which would need baby-proofing; windows in bedrooms have security grilles which is good for child safety. The unit is spacious at 44 ping with multiple rooms and decent natural light, but being on 3F with no elevator confirmed could be inconvenient with a stroller; the bare-bones listing description is a red flag suggesting this may be an agent placeholder ad rather than a genuine rental."}
