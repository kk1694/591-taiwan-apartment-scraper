{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious 45-ping apartment in good modern condition with polished tile floors in living area, hardwood in bedrooms, recessed lighting, and built-in cabinetry. At least 3 bedrooms visible including a master with vanity and a smaller room suitable as a nursery. Living room has large windows with decent natural light and a balcony with sliding glass doors. The glass coffee table with sharp corners is a baby safety concern, and the balcony access should be secured; the 2nd floor location reduces elevator dependency but the building's elevator status is unclear. Overall clean, well-maintained, and family-friendly for the price point."}
