{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylishly furnished apartment with high-end finishes including marble coffee tables, tufted velvet sofa, modern kitchen with glass backsplash, induction cooktop, and built-in microwave. The space appears clean and well-maintained. For baby safety, the glass coffee table edges and small decorative items on low surfaces are concerns; the glass partition between living room and bedroom has no sharp edges but the sliding door may need a finger guard. On the 13th floor, the unit likely has good natural light (visible through bedroom window). Note: the listing description is minimal (just an agent promotion), and the images look somewhat staged/model-unit-like, so actual furnishing may differ. Being on floor 13 of 19 in Datong district strongly suggests an elevator building."}
