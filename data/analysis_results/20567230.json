{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern LED lighting, new wood-look flooring, and updated bathroom with contemporary fixtures. Very clean and bright with large balcony sliding doors providing good natural light. For baby safety: balcony has railings visible but would need child locks on sliding doors; windows have security bars which prevent falls; no stairs visible; floors are smooth without sharp corners. Being on 5F/5F with no elevator info could be a concern for stroller access."}
