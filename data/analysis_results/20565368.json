{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Nicely renovated loft-style apartment with modern furnishings, split AC, washing machine, and stylish decor. Major baby safety concern: the open-tread metal staircase leading to the upper loft has wide gaps between steps and railings that a toddler could easily fall through or climb — this is a serious hazard. Natural light appears limited with roller shutters on the windows and no visible large windows; the space feels somewhat compact despite the loft adding usable area."}
