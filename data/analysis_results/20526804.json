{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Tianmu/Shilin/Beitou area", "notes": "Very modern, brand-new luxury apartment in a sleek 14-story building with elevator. The unit is unfurnished with high-quality built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, polished tile floors, and ceiling-mounted AC — all in excellent condition. The balcony has glass panel railings which are a significant baby safety concern as a toddler could potentially climb the lower solid portion; the smooth tile floors are slippery but easy to clean. Spacious 30-ping layout with good natural light from large windows, and the high floor (6F) provides nice city views."}
