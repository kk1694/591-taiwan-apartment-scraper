{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with high-end finishes including marble-look flooring, recessed LED lighting, textured wallpaper, and sliding glass partition between living room and bedroom. The unit is clean and well-maintained, managed by HOYUAN Real Estate Agency. The bedroom has floor-to-ceiling windows providing decent natural light and an en-suite bathroom with glass shower enclosure. For baby safety, the marble-look tile flooring is hard and slippery, the glass sliding partitions and glass shower door could be concerns, and the low coffee table has sharp edges; no balcony railings are visible. At 23 ping in Da'an district for NT$54,000 this is reasonably priced for the quality and location."}
