{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with high-quality built-in cabinetry, modern kitchen with induction cooktop and built-in appliances. Clean minimalist design with light wood finishes. For baby safety: the space appears safe with no visible balcony, no stairs, and rounded furniture edges on the sofa and stools; however the bar stools could be a climbing hazard. Good natural light from kitchen window, overall excellent condition with no red flags."}
