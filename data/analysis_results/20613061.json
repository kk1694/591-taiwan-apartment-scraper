{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "This is a multi-level apartment (1F with internal staircase to upper area) with older traditional wooden furniture and dated decor. The internal staircase without a gate is a significant baby safety hazard, and the glass coffee table with sharp corners also poses risks. The apartment is clean with decent tile flooring and LED lighting, but natural light appears limited (photos taken at night); there is a large fish tank room divider and a green emergency exit sign visible in the living room, which is unusual for a residential unit and may indicate this is part of a commercial or mixed-use building. The bedroom is small with the mattress propped up, suggesting the space may not be fully move-in ready."}
