{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanglong Street, Da'an District, near Liuzhanglli MRT (666m)", "notes": "3BR/2BA whole-floor apartment in a 9-story elevator building on Wanglong Street, Da'an. Comes furnished with fridge, washer, TV, AC, water heater, bed, wardrobe, sofa, and one balcony. Pet-friendly with 1-year minimum lease. Good for a couple expecting a baby given the 3-bedroom layout and elevator access, though the 2F location and balcony should be checked for child safety railings. Condition/modernity unclear from description alone — an in-person visit is recommended. NT$3,000/month management fee on top of rent; deposit is 2 months."}
