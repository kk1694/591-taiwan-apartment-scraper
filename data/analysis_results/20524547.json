{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, hotel-quality apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreign-focused rental agency). Clean minimalist interior with wood-tone furniture, L-shaped sofa, flat-screen TV, queen bed, and a well-appointed bathroom with bathtub and glass-enclosed shower. The balcony has glass-and-metal railings with horizontal slat lower panels — a baby safety concern as a toddler could potentially climb the horizontal bars, so a balcony barrier would be needed. Good natural light from multiple windows. At 13 ping for NT$90k this is on the expensive side but the quality and foreigner-friendly management are notable positives. The listing description is essentially empty (just an ad for agent packages), which is a minor red flag — verify details directly with the agent."}
