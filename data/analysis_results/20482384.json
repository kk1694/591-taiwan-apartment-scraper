{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi district, hillside/mountain area", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, light wood flooring, recessed lighting, and quality furnishings including L-shaped sofa, Hitachi fridge, and breakfast bar. Beautiful mountain/forest views from large windows suggest a hillside location in Xinyi, possibly near Elephant Mountain or the outskirts. For baby safety, the kitchen bar stools and open shelving with decorative items on high shelves are minor concerns; windows appear to be sealed sliding type which is good. Being on 4F of a 5-floor walkup with no visible elevator is a significant drawback for carrying a stroller and baby daily."}
