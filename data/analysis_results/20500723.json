{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near Taipei 101", "notes": "Spacious modern apartment on the 19th floor with excellent natural light and panoramic city views including Taipei 101. Clean, minimalist interior with open-plan kitchen, white tile floors, and updated appliances. For baby safety: the large floor-to-ceiling windows need child locks, and the kitchen island with bar stools may require supervision; no visible balcony railings or stairs, which is positive for a family with a baby."}
