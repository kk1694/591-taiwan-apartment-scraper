{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, professionally designed apartment with elegant European-style finishes, marble counters, dark hardwood floors, and modern recessed lighting. Very clean and well-maintained condition. For baby safety: the raised tatami platform area and open wine rack at low height could pose concerns; no visible balcony or dangerous railings in photos. Good natural light through large windows with blinds."}
