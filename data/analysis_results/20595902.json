{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang", "notes": "Very modern high-rise apartment on the 14th floor with recessed LED lighting, central air conditioning, polished tile floors, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light and city views. The unit appears newly built or recently renovated with clean minimalist finishes; multiple rooms are visible but mostly unfurnished aside from a sofa. For baby safety, the large windows have secure framing with no accessible balcony visible, and the flat single-level layout with no stairs is ideal, though the hard polished tile floors would benefit from soft mats; being the top floor (14/14) in a modern tower strongly suggests elevator access. Red flag: the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), so layout details, kitchen, and bathroom are unknown."}
