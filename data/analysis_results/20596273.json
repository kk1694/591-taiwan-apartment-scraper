{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older walk-up apartment in Da'an with dated parquet flooring, aging wallpaper, and basic fixtures throughout. The bathroom is very basic with an open wet-room shower, exposed plumbing, and slippery tile floors which are a safety concern for a family with a baby. The kitchen has a Sakura gas stove and range hood but is otherwise minimal. The apartment is unfurnished with decent space (30 ping) but limited natural light due to frosted/obscured windows; being on the 3rd floor of a 4-story building with no elevator means carrying a stroller up stairs daily."}
