{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Only 2 images available showing a street view from the 4th floor and a bright yellow wall with decorative posters. The building appears to be an older walk-up (4F/4F with no elevator visible, older facade with external AC units and aged exterior). Being on the top floor of a no-elevator walk-up is a major concern for a couple expecting a baby — carrying a stroller up 4 flights is very difficult. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent advertisement), which is a red flag. Very limited photos make it impossible to assess interior condition, baby safety features, or layout for 27 ping at NT$60,000."}
