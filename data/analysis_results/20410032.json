{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with pristine white walls, polished tile floors, LED strip lighting, and modern fixtures including video intercom and split AC units. The unit appears extremely clean with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the balcony has glass railings which may need additional barriers; the open floor plan has no stairs or sharp corners, making it relatively safe for a crawling baby."}
