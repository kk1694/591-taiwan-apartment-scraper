The unit has excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows on multiple sides, with greenery views. Baby safety concerns include the internal staircase between levels (no visible gate or railing guards), the raised platform bed area with steps, and a balcony/terrace accessible through large sliding doors in the upper bedroom; the slippery polished tile floors downstairs could also be a concern for a crawling baby."}
