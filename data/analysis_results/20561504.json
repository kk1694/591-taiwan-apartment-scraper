{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious 30-ping apartment with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, and clean tile/wood flooring throughout. Features a large living room, at least two bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms, and a walk-in closet with vanity area — plenty of space for a family. Windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, but the marble coffee table has sharp corners and the tile floors are hard; natural light appears limited as windows face what looks like a light well or narrow alley rather than open views."}
