{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "This is a modern high-rise building (18 floors) with luxury common areas including a lounge with marble finishes, a reading/café area, and a private meeting room. The building exterior is sleek and well-maintained. However, a major red flag is that all photos show only the building exterior and communal amenity spaces — no interior unit photos are provided, making it impossible to assess the actual apartment condition, layout, natural light, or baby safety features like balcony railings and sharp corners. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), which is another concern. The upscale common areas suggest a newer premium development, but the lack of unit photos warrants caution and an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
