{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District, near hills/mountains", "notes": "Modern high-rise building (12 floors) with upscale amenities including rooftop garden terrace, staffed lobby with meeting area, and a well-equipped gym. The unit interior appears clean with modern light fixtures and tiled flooring, though furnishings are modest. The building has a 7-Eleven at street level for convenience. For baby safety, the balcony railings on the building exterior appear to have standard metal bars which is good; however, the coffee table in the living room has sharp corners that would need padding, and the window in the living room should be checked for child locks. Good natural light with mountain views from the 10th floor. Red flag: the listing description is essentially empty (just a sales promotion), so the actual unit layout and number of rooms is unknown — request more details before committing."}
