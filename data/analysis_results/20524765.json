{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unit with modern finishes, Sharp appliances, built-in kitchen with oven and microwave, and a clean glass-enclosed bathroom with bathtub. Good natural light from balcony access. For baby safety: balcony door needs child-proofing, glass bathroom door and hard tile floors are concerns, but no stairs and no visible sharp corners. Appears to still be under final fitting with exposed ceiling wires and light fixtures pending installation."}
