{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-renovated apartment with modern recessed lighting, central and split AC, light wood flooring, built-in cabinetry and desk area, large leather sectional sofa, and massage chair. The unit is very clean with a bright, neutral color scheme and decent natural light from multiple windows with curtains. Being on 4F/4F with no visible elevator in an older walk-up building is a significant concern for a pregnant woman and later carrying a baby upstairs; the open floor plan is baby-friendly with few sharp corners, though the large glass yellow accent wall and window bars should be noted."}
