{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment with high-quality finishes including polished tile floors, built-in wooden cabinetry, and a sleek open-plan kitchen with washing machine. Good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: the bedroom has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to what appears to be a balcony that would need child-proofing; furniture has rounded edges which is positive. Being on 8F/8F (top floor) without confirmed elevator access could be challenging with a baby and stroller."}
