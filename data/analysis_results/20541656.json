{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious modern apartment with high-end finishes, open-plan living with glass partitions separating bedroom area, modern kitchen with built-in appliances, and in-unit washer. The space features excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows and a balcony. For baby safety, the glass partition edges and low furniture would need childproofing; the balcony door requires a secure lock when baby becomes mobile. Overall very clean and well-maintained."}
