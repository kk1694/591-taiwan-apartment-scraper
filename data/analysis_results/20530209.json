{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, newly renovated unfurnished apartment with polished marble floors, recessed lighting, open-plan kitchen with modern cabinetry and built-in appliances, and split AC units in each room. Very clean with no visible hazards, though the balcony door in one bedroom requires checking for secure railings. Being on 5F of a 15F building strongly suggests elevator access. Spacious layout suitable for a family, no sharp corners or stairs visible."}
