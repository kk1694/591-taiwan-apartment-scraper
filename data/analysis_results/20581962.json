{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture. The unit appears spacious with an open kitchen/dining/living layout. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) without visible elevator info is a concern. The coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the bar stool area near the kitchen could be hazardous for toddlers. Good natural light through windows with greenery views."}
