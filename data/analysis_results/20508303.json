{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with sleek minimalist design, LED strip lighting, marble-look flooring, and high-end built-in cabinetry. The open-plan layout is clean and spacious with good lighting. For baby safety, the coffee tables have some sharp metal edges that may need corner guards, but overall the space has no stairs, low furniture, and rounded sofa corners. Being on 4F of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
