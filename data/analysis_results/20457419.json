{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern studio with space-saving Murphy bed, white tile floors, modern kitchen with washer/dryer, microwave, and refrigerator. Good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: the Murphy bed mechanism and bar stool seating could be concerns; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings. The space is compact at 11 ping which may feel cramped with a baby."}
