{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with sleek minimalist design, modern built-in kitchen with Sharp fridge and built-in oven, LG washing machine, and stylish furniture. The building lobby (image 5) is upscale with marble finishes and elegant furnishings, confirming this is a newer high-rise with elevator. At 13.25 ping this is a studio/1-bedroom that may feel compact for a growing family; no balcony or stairs visible which is good for baby safety, but the open kitchen layout means the cooking area is not separated and would need baby-proofing around appliances. Natural light is unclear as curtains are drawn in all photos, which could be a concern."}
