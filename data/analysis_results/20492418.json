{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with sleek white cabinetry, black granite countertops, track lighting, and polished tile floors throughout. Excellent natural light from large windows with mountain views. Baby safety concerns: balcony with vertical railings accessible from kitchen area, and the kitchen island with sharp granite corners would need childproofing. Unit is on the top floor (10F/10F), clean and move-in ready condition."}
