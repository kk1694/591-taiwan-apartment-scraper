{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with two distinct living areas — one with herringbone flooring and dark wood trim, another with lighter finishes and decorative wallpaper. The unit is unfurnished, spacious at 28 ping, with recessed lighting, AC units, and sliding glass balcony doors. For baby safety, the balcony access doors and lack of railings visible in photos should be checked in person; the open floor plan with no stairs is a plus. Natural light appears moderate with windows on multiple sides, though some views face adjacent buildings closely. The listing description is essentially empty (just an ad for the agent platform), which is a minor red flag — important details like layout, lease terms, and amenities are missing."}
