{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, newly renovated apartment in a 21-floor building with clean white walls, polished tile floors, TOTO bathroom fixtures, glass shower enclosure, and split AC. The unit appears to be set up as a shared apartment with single beds and small desks in bedrooms, which is a red flag — it may be rented by the room rather than as a whole unit. No windows are visible in the bedroom photos suggesting limited natural light; no balcony is shown, which is safer for a baby but limits ventilation. The tile floors are slippery and the furniture has some sharp corners on the desk frames that would need baby-proofing."}
