{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-finished apartment in Xinyi with polished marble-look wall tiles, crystal chandeliers, leather sofa, large TV, and glossy tile flooring throughout. The glass balcony doors show a small balcony with metal railings that appear adequate; however, the hard tile floors and sharp-edged bar-height dining table with swivel stools are baby safety concerns. Only living and dining areas are shown — no bedroom or bathroom photos available, and the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag."}
