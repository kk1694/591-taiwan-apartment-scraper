{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment on the 24th floor with clean light wood laminate flooring, recessed LED lighting, sleek TV feature wall with stone cladding, built-in cabinetry, and wall-mounted AC units. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at 28.8 ping with large floor-to-ceiling balcony sliding doors providing excellent natural light and city views. For baby safety, the balcony glass doors should be secured with child locks; the open floor plan with no stairs and smooth rounded built-in furniture edges is generally baby-friendly, though the low TV shelf edge is a minor bump hazard. Listed via Taiwan Real Estate (台灣房屋) agent; the minimal description suggests this is an agent-posted listing with limited detail."}
