{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Neihu, near Fuxing/Minquan area (復興民權)", "notes": "This is a recently renovated 2-story townhouse/rowhouse (1F/2F) with modern finishes including a sleek kitchen with recessed lighting, new bathroom with LED mirror and rain shower, and light gray vinyl plank flooring. Major baby safety concern: the interior staircase between floors has open railings with wide gaps that a toddler could fit through, and the outdoor rear area has exposed pipes, railings, and steps that would need childproofing. The ground floor entrance appears to be a converted garage/carport space with terrazzo flooring, suggesting this may have originally been a commercial or mixed-use property rather than a standard apartment, which raises questions about its residential suitability and natural light—interior photos show no visible windows in the living area."}
