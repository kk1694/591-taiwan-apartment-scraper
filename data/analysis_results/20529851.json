{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with designer finishes including marble TV feature wall, recessed lighting, wooden beam ceiling accents, and light wood-tone flooring throughout. The living room has large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light, and bedrooms feature built-in shelving and storage. For baby safety, the large living room windows appear to have low sills that would need child-proofing, and the bold red sliding door with textured glass panel in one bedroom has sharp metal hardware worth noting; overall the flat open layout with no visible stairs is good for a crawling baby. At 50 ping this is a spacious, clean, and well-maintained unit, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad) which is a minor red flag — confirm layout details and actual room count directly with the agent."}
