{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment in a newer building with clean wood-tone flooring, built-in cabinetry, ceiling fan, and a full kitchen with gas stove and large refrigerator. The bathroom has a bathtub (baby safety concern - needs supervision) and the living room has a balcony door with floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. Children's toys visible on the floor suggest previous/current family occupancy, which is a positive sign. The coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need baby-proofing, and the bathtub's raised stone edge is a slip hazard for toddlers. Overall very clean and spacious at 34 ping, suitable for a growing family."}
