{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Modern high-rise residential building with a contemporary facade featuring greenery-covered balconies and clean architectural lines. The building appears to be a newer luxury development with at least 15 floors, confirming elevator access. At 39.6 ping on the 9th floor, this is a spacious unit suitable for a family; however, the balconies visible in the exterior shot have horizontal railings that would need childproofing, and with only one exterior image and a minimal description (appears to be an agent placeholder listing), there are no interior photos to assess baby safety, natural light, or apartment condition — this is a significant red flag suggesting the listing may lack substance or be primarily an advertisement."}
