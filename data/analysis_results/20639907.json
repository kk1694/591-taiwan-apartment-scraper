Features updated fixtures including split AC, modern bathroom with bathtub and electronic bidet toilet. Multiple bedrooms with ample storage. For baby safety: no visible balcony concerns in images, but glass coffee table with sharp corners in living room would need childproofing. Good natural light from windows. Clean condition throughout."}
