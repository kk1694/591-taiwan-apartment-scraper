{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a well-maintained but older-style apartment with traditional Chinese wooden furniture throughout. The unit is clean with good natural light from the balcony, and includes AC. For baby safety, the heavy wooden furniture has some sharp corners on the coffee table and TV stand, and the balcony access doors would need childproofing; the glass sliding doors to the balcony appear to have standard railings visible outside. The dated decor and heavy furniture style may feel cramped but the 18.9 ping size is reasonable for a small family."}
