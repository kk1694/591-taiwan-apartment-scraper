{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, 信安街103巷 (Xin'an Street Lane 103), near Liuzhang Li MRT Station (350m)", "notes": "Renovated within 3 years, 2BR/1BA whole-floor unit in a 5-story elevator building with good natural light and balcony. Pet-friendly, furnished, cooking allowed with natural gas. For a couple with a baby: the elevator is a major plus, but being on 3F with a balcony warrants checking railing height/gaps; only 1 bathroom may be tight; the nearby elementary school and medical university hospital suggest a family-friendly area. No major red flags — agent-listed via Elegant Realty, 2-month deposit, minimum 1-year lease."}
