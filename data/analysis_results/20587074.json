{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Large, well-maintained older-style apartment with ornate crown molding, recessed ceiling details, and traditional wooden cabinetry throughout — clearly from the 1990s-2000s era rather than modern. The unit is spacious at 41.72 ping with at least 3 bedrooms, a large living room with leather sofa, and a dining area with full-size refrigerator. For baby safety, the glass-top coffee table has sharp corners, the balcony visible from the living room needs rail height verification, and the many built-in wooden cabinet edges throughout could pose bumping hazards. Natural light is decent from windows and the balcony, and the overall cleanliness is good though the decor is dated and heavy."}
