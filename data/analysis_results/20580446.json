{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, modern recessed LED lighting, light wood-tone laminate flooring, AC units, and updated cabinetry. The space is spacious and open-plan with a large living area, but natural light appears very limited with only small windows partly covered by curtains, giving it a somewhat basement-like feel. For baby safety, the flat floors with no stairs are good, but the glass-front cabinet and sharp-cornered furniture (wooden stools, lift-top table) would need childproofing; the listing description is essentially just a broker ad with no real property details, which is a minor red flag."}
