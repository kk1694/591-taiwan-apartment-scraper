{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with brand new white kitchen cabinets, gray subway tile backsplash, and light wood laminate flooring throughout. Large balcony with metal railings that would need baby-proofing as gaps could be a concern for a crawling child. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors. Clean, unfurnished, and move-in ready with no visible red flags."}
