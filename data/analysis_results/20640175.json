{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with high ceilings, polished tile floors, recessed/accent lighting, leather sofa, and split AC units. The unit appears spacious at ~25 ping with a separate dining area, living room, and visible bedroom and bathroom. There is a decorative wrought-iron railing on a mezzanine/loft area and what appears to be stairs leading up to it, which would be a significant baby safety concern requiring gates. The large windows provide good natural light, and the slippery polished tile floors and sharp-cornered coffee table are minor concerns for a crawling baby. On floor 10 of 14 in Da'an district, the building almost certainly has an elevator."}
