{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with attractive herringbone laminate flooring, modern AC units in multiple rooms, and decorative accent walls. The unit is unfurnished and clean with multiple rooms including a balcony accessed via sliding glass doors. The bathroom is older with basic fixtures and a bathtub but is functional. For baby safety, the bathtub lacks a non-slip surface, the balcony sliding doors should be secured, and the tiled bathroom floor may be slippery; natural light appears moderate through windows and balcony. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), suggesting foreigner-friendly landlord, which is a plus."}
