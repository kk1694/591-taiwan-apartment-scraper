{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment in Da'an with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, AC units, and contemporary furnishings. Major baby safety concern: the open internal staircase to the loft/mezzanine level has no railing or gate and floating-style steps, which is extremely dangerous for a crawling baby or toddler. The floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors to the balcony also need child-proofing. The space is clean with good natural light from large windows, but the loft layout with exposed stairs makes this a poor choice for a family with a baby."}
