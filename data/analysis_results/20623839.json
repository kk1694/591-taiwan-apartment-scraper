{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older building in good clean condition with spacious interior (42 ping), tile floors, and basic fixtures like chandeliers and wall-mounted AC. The balcony has low walls that could be a safety concern for a crawling baby. Natural light is decent through multiple windows but the building and surrounding area appear dated. Being on 1F means no stairs inside but ground floor can have security and noise concerns."}
