{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern open-plan studio with industrial-chic design featuring exposed dark ceiling grid, wood-look flooring, and contemporary furnishings including a leather sofa, projector screen, and smart door lock. The kitchen has a sleek induction cooktop, range hood, and stainless fridge. However, this unit has strong commercial/office conversion vibes — the exposed ceiling tiles, layout, and overall aesthetic suggest it may be a converted office or commercial space rather than a standard residential apartment. The balcony area with glass railings could be a concern for baby safety, and at 12 ping as a studio it will feel cramped for a couple with a baby. Natural light appears limited with only zebra blinds on what seem to be few windows."}
