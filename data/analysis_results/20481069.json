{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment in an older building with freshly painted white walls but dated stone/marble tile flooring and frosted glass windows suggesting an older structure. The bathroom has been recently renovated with modern tiles and fixtures. The space is completely empty with no furniture or appliances, which means significant move-in costs. For baby safety, the hard stone tile floors are a concern for falls, and the windows have security grilles which is positive; however, the 2nd floor with no confirmed elevator could be inconvenient with a stroller. Natural light is limited due to frosted/textured glass on all windows."}
