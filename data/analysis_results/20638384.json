{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with decorative wooden ceiling beams and traditional Chinese-style furniture, giving a dated but clean appearance. The unit is spacious at 32 ping with a large living area, open kitchen, balcony with greenery, and a functional bathroom with glass shower partition; however, the wall shows patchy paint (possible water damage or unfinished repair), the window AC units are old-style, and the balcony sliding doors would need child-proofing for baby safety. Being on the 3rd floor of a 4-story walkup with no elevator would be challenging with a stroller and baby gear."}
