{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wenshan District", "notes": "The listing description is essentially empty, containing only a generic promotional message for the listing platform rather than any actual property details. At 54 ping (178.2 sqm) for NT$45,000/month in Wenshan District, the price seems reasonable for the size. Being on the 2nd floor of a 5-story building without confirmed elevator access could be manageable but worth verifying, especially with a baby and stroller. No images or substantive description are available to assess modernity, baby safety features, or overall condition — an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
