{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with light wood laminate flooring, open-plan kitchen with island counter, and floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. The balcony has metal railings that appear adequately spaced but should be checked in person for baby safety; the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. The description is minimal (just an agent ad), and only 5 photos are shown with no bedroom or bathroom visible, which is a minor red flag — confirm layout and full room count before committing. Being on 2F of a 5F building, elevator status is unclear but the low floor is convenient with a stroller."}
