{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "All images show only the exterior street view and building facade with no interior photos. The building appears to be a modern high-rise (18 floors), but one image shows a commercial storefront entrance (和貓咪有約 - a cat cafe or similar business). This appears to be a commercial/retail space on the ground floor rather than a residential apartment. No interior views to assess baby safety, condition, or natural light. Major red flag: listing may be for a commercial space, not a residential unit."}
