{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "The living area has been recently renovated with modern light wood flooring, modern LED ring light fixture, large L-shaped sofa, massage chair, and wall-mounted TV/AC, but the bathrooms are clearly older with dated tiles, exposed plumbing, and signs of wear. A unique feature is the hallway with climbing wall holds on both walls, which is a serious baby safety hazard as a toddler could grab and climb them. The building is a 4-story walkup (2F/4F) likely without elevator, and the older bathroom with bathtub and wet floor design also poses slip risks for a family with a baby."}
