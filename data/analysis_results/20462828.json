{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, digital door lock, recessed lighting, and quality wood cabinetry. The space appears clean and well-maintained with a kitchen, washing machine, and good storage. For baby safety, the furniture has mostly rounded edges, no stairs visible, and no balcony railings shown; however, the open shelving unit near dining area could be a climbing hazard for a toddler. Good artificial lighting though natural light appears limited based on the dark window views."}
