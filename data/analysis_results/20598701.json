{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio with high ceilings, contemporary furnishings, LED lighting, and built-in storage. Major baby safety concern: there is a loft area with a steep metal ladder that would be dangerous for a crawling baby or toddler. The space is clean with good natural light from large windows, but the open loft design is not ideal for families with young children."}
