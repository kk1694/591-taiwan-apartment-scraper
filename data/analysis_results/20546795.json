{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi Road Section 4, Lane 265, Da'an District - 3 min walk to Xinyi Anhe MRT", "notes": "2+1 bedroom elevator apartment on floors 6-7 (likely a duplex/loft unit), fully furnished with AC, fridge, washer, and sofa. Listed by Hero House Realty which specializes in expat rentals. The duplex layout with internal stairs between floors 6 and 7 is a significant baby safety concern — stairs will need gating. Has a balcony which will need childproofing. No pets allowed. Condition cannot be fully confirmed from description alone, but the agent markets it as a quality building. NT$1,000/month management fee on top of rent. Excellent location near Xinyi Anhe MRT with good transit access."}
