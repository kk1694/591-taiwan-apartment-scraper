{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, light wood-tone flooring, track lighting, and contemporary kitchen with black appliances. The unit appears to be a loft-style duplex with internal stairs visible in image 2, which is a significant baby safety concern — stairs with open metal railings would need baby gates. Good natural light from large windows. At 25 ping on 2F of a 24-story building, elevator is virtually certain. The space looks clean and well-maintained but the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag."}
