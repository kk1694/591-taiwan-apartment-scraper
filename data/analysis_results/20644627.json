{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed lighting, split AC, and contemporary furnishings. The space is bright with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. For baby safety, the balcony railings appear to be horizontal slats which could be a climbing hazard; the open-plan layout has no stairs but the glass coffee table has sharp corners. Building has a gym facility, indicating a newer high-rise with elevator."}
