{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with stylish finishes including wood panel accent walls, AC units, and contemporary furniture. The space appears clean with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners, there's a small balcony visible that would need childproofing, and low electrical outlets are visible. The compact kitchen has a washing machine and induction cooktop which are safer than gas. Being on 4F of a 14F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
