{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and modern unfurnished apartment in Da'an with polished tile floors in the living area and light wood-look flooring in bedrooms, recessed lighting, and clean white walls. The unit is on the 1st floor of a 13-story building, which is convenient for stroller access but the sliding glass doors to what appears to be a ground-level patio/balcony area would need baby-proofing locks. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), the apartment appears very clean and well-maintained with no visible red flags, though being unfurnished means additional setup costs."}
