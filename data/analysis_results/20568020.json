{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes, recessed lighting, and quality furniture including leather sofa. Kitchen includes new refrigerator, washer, and gas stove. For baby safety: the apartment is single-level with no stairs, but the balcony sliding doors and coffee table with sharp edges would need childproofing. Spacious 50 ping layout appears clean and well-maintained with good natural light from large windows."}
