{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated empty apartment with fresh white walls, new light wood laminate flooring, modern LED ceiling lights, and updated dark-framed windows. The unit is very spacious at ~36 ping with multiple rooms and appears clean with no sharp corners or hazards visible; however it is completely unfurnished so you would need all furniture and appliances. Being on 4F/5F with no elevator information visible could be a concern for carrying a stroller and baby up stairs. Natural light appears moderate with windows in bedrooms but the main living area seems somewhat enclosed. No bathroom or kitchen photos were provided which is a red flag — confirm their condition before signing."}
