{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated finishes - basic white tile floors, older wooden cabinetry, and standard fixtures from roughly 15-20 years ago. The space is quite large and clean but unfurnished. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling sliding doors with screens which is good, but the concrete feature wall has exposed electrical outlets near floor level that would need covers. Limited natural light visible in the bedroom with small windows."}
