{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment managed by UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly rental agency). Features recessed LED lighting, stylish living room with large sliding glass doors to balcony, modern kitchen with breakfast bar, built-in wardrobes, a study/nursery room, and a clean modern bathroom with glass-enclosed shower and bidet toilet. At 32.88 ping on 2F of an 11-floor building, it is spacious and likely has an elevator. For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors should be kept locked, and the glass shower partition in the bathroom may need attention; overall the flat surfaces and lack of visible stairs make it relatively baby-safe."}
