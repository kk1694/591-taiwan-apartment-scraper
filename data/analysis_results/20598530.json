{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with clean minimalist design, built-in wall cabinets, wall-mounted TV, and split AC. The video intercom by the door suggests a secure building with elevator access (typical for buildings with this feature). Baby-safe features: no visible sharp corners on furniture, smooth flooring, rounded coffee table edges. The space appears clean with good indirect lighting. Being on 4F/18F in this type of modern building strongly indicates elevator access."}
