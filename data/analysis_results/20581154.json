{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Modern building with clean, polished tile floors and fresh white walls throughout. The apartment is unfurnished (mostly empty rooms) at 53 ping, spacious for a family. The building exterior is a newer-style reinforced concrete construction with an elevator (7-floor building). Multiple rooms have good natural light from black-framed windows with curtains. For baby safety, the hard polished tile floors could be slippery and unforgiving for falls — area rugs or foam mats recommended. Balcony railings on the building exterior appear to have horizontal bars which a toddler could potentially climb, worth inspecting in person. No kitchen or bathroom photos provided, which is a notable gap — verify condition of those spaces before committing."}
