{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean but dated apartment with older-style wallpaper, basic ceiling light fixtures, and wall-mounted AC units typical of 1990s-2000s Taiwanese buildings. The unit is unfurnished with polished tile floors, a separate galley kitchen with gas stove, built-in sliding-door wardrobes, and multiple bedrooms with windows providing natural light. For baby safety, the living room has a sliding glass door to a balcony that would need childproofing, and the windows have security grilles which are good for safety; the flat single-level layout with no stairs is ideal for a family with a baby."}
