{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songjiang Rd 252 Lane, Zhongshan District, near Songjiang Nanjing MRT", "notes": "Brand new first-hand decoration studio apartment with full furnishings and appliances in a 10-story elevator building. At NT$48,000/month for ~37 sqm studio, this is on the pricier side but the new condition and proximity to Songjiang Nanjing MRT (502m) are positives. However, as a studio (套房) it may be tight for a couple with a baby — no separate bedroom means limited space for a crib; the balcony should be checked for railing safety, and the listing notes no pets are allowed so confirm baby/family-friendliness with the agent. Mechanical parking is available for separate rental."}
