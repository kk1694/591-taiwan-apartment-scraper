{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious older-style apartment with mixed condition - the living area has updated white tile flooring and built-in shelving, but bedrooms have dated wood paneling and older window-unit AC. The apartment appears clean but has an outdated aesthetic. For baby safety, the windows have security grilles which is good, but there are exposed electrical cables on floors that would need addressing; natural light appears limited in some rooms."}
