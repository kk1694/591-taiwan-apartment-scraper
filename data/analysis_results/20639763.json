{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern, and very clean unfurnished apartment with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and a modern kitchen visible through glass partition; managed by UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a foreigner-friendly rental agency. Being on the 1st floor of a 13-story building (likely has elevator), the sliding glass doors open to a ground-level patio/courtyard area which is great for a baby but the glass doors should be secured with child locks; the open layout with minimal sharp corners is baby-friendly, though the highly polished slippery tile floors could be a concern for a crawling/walking toddler. Natural light appears moderate from the windows and patio doors, and the 38 ping size in Da'an district at NT$85,000 is reasonable for this premium location."}
