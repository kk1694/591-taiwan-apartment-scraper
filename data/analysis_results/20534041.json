{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with contemporary finishes including recessed lighting, ceiling-mounted AC, light wood laminate flooring, and built-in closets. The unit appears clean and unfurnished with multiple bedrooms, a galley kitchen with gas stove and range hood, and good natural light from large windows. Baby safety concerns include a raised platform in one bedroom and a balcony visible in image 5 with standard railings that would need childproofing - floor 7 height requires attention to window and balcony access."}
