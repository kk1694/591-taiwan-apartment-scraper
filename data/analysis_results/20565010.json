{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "This is a multi-story townhouse (透天) with an internal wooden staircase spanning at least two floors, not an apartment. The ground floor has a street-level glass storefront entrance resembling a commercial space, with tile walls and minimal furnishings. Major baby safety concern: the steep open staircase with widely-spaced balusters is a serious fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler. The unit appears mostly unfurnished, clean but dated with older-style window AC units, exposed wiring on walls, and limited natural light on the ground floor. Red flag: the listing description is essentially empty (just an ad for agent packages), providing no real information about the property."}
