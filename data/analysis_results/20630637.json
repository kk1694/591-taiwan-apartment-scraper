The living area is exceptionally large with ample open space suitable for a baby to play safely. For baby safety, the coffee table has rounded edges but corners on built-in furniture should be monitored; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access in photos. Good overall cleanliness and condition, though natural light appears limited in these photos."}
