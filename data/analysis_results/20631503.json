{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with basic furnishings including a white sofa, simple TV stand, wall-mounted AC, and basic wardrobe with mirror. The unit is on the top floor (6F/6F) which may mean heat issues and no elevator (older walkup building). For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners, the bamboo clothing rack could tip over, and the wardrobe mirror is a breakage risk; the balcony visible in the living room has grid-style railings which is positive. Natural light appears limited based on the bedroom curtains and overall dim photos. The description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — very little information provided for a 45K/month Xinyi listing."}
