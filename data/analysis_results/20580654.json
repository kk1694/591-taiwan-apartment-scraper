{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment in Da'an with polished white tile floors, a large L-shaped leather sofa, glass coffee table, TV console, dining table with chairs, and a white fitted kitchen. The unit appears spacious at 38 ping with good natural light from large sliding windows. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the smooth tile floors could be slippery; no stairs or dangerous balcony access visible in the photos, which is positive for baby safety. The description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), so further details on layout and bedroom count should be confirmed."}
