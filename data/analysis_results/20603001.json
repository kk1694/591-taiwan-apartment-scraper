{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, AC units, and ceiling fans. The living area is spacious at 40 ping with a raised loft/mezzanine sleeping area accessed by a metal ladder, which is a significant baby safety hazard — the open railings and steep ladder pose fall risks for a crawling or toddling child. The kitchen is narrow but functional with modern red cabinetry and a full-size refrigerator. Good natural light from large windows, and the glass coffee table with sharp edges would also need baby-proofing."}
