{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very stylish, recently renovated apartment with modern industrial-chic design including black metal-framed glass partitions, track lighting, white brick accent TV wall, and light wood flooring. The space is clean and well-maintained with built-in storage, a split AC, digital door lock, and video intercom. For baby safety, the glass partition doors have sharp metal frames at toddler height, the rolling office chair could be hazardous, and the balcony sliding doors should be checked for child locks; however the flat open floor plan with no stairs is a plus. Natural light comes from the balcony-side windows but appears moderate given the urban surroundings."}
