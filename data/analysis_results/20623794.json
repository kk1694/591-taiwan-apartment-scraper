{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "This listing appears to be a broker/agent advertisement rather than a genuine rental listing - the description only contains a promotional message about purchasing a sales package with no actual property details. At 49.57 ping (163.6 sqm) for NT$79,999/month in Datong District, the price seems reasonable for the size but the lack of any real description or property details is a red flag. Without images or meaningful description, baby safety features, natural light, and overall condition cannot be assessed."}
