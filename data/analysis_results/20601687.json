{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious, high-end modern apartment on the 15th floor with recessed LED lighting, hardwood flooring, large panoramic windows providing excellent natural light and mountain views, stone accent wall, and quality leather sofa. The open living area is very clean and well-maintained with no visible stairs; the glass coffee table has sharp corners which would need baby-proofing. Listed by An-Ho Real Estate; only living room photos shown so kitchen/bathroom/bedroom condition is unknown, and the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — verify room count and full amenities in person."}
