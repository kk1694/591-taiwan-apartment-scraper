{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with sleek white and grey finishes, recessed LED lighting, marble-pattern dining table, modern kitchen with glass backsplash and induction cooktop, and a clean bathroom with glass-enclosed shower. The balcony has sliding glass doors with adequate railing height, and the flat tiled floors are baby-friendly, though the marble-effect table has sharp corners that would need padding. The description is essentially empty (just a broker ad placeholder), so no additional location or layout details are available; at 19 ping for NT$56k in Zhongzheng this is a compact but well-finished unit, however the lack of a visible bedroom door suggests a small 1-bedroom layout that may feel tight for a growing family."}
