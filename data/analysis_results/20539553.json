{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with clean minimalist design, light wood flooring, recessed lighting, open-plan kitchen with island bar, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing decent greenery views though being on 2F may limit natural light. For baby safety, the bar stools with chrome bases and the open kitchen island with sharp corners would need attention, and the metal hanging rack above the island could be a concern; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings. The space is very clean and spacious at 37 ping, well-suited for a family in the desirable Da'an district."}
