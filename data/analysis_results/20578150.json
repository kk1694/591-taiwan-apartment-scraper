{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment with clean condition but dated classical decor (ornate crown molding, traditional sofas). Very clean tile floors and good natural light from multiple windows with AC units. For baby safety: tile floors are slippery, metal shelving rack in bedroom has sharp edges/tipover risk, no visible stairs or balcony hazards in photos. Furniture is minimal but functional."}
