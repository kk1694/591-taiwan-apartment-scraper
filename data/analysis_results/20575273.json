{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated parquet flooring and window-mounted AC units throughout. The unit is unfurnished, clean, and spacious with multiple bedrooms. Being on the 5th floor of a 5-floor building without visible elevator clues is a concern; the balcony has standard sliding doors that may need child-proofing. Good natural light from large windows, but overall fixtures and finishes appear dated from the 1980s-90s era."}
