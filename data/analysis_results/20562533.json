{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Artistically renovated unit with exposed wooden beams, traditional Chinese carved wood panels, and a glass-partitioned living/dining area giving it a distinctive loft-like aesthetic, but the kitchen appliances and cabinets appear dated and worn. The building has an elevator (clearly visible in lobby photo) and a well-maintained common area lobby. Baby safety concerns include the glass coffee table with sharp corners, exposed wooden beam structures at reachable heights, and the glass partition walls between rooms; the overall cleanliness is fair but the kitchen shows signs of age and wear."}
