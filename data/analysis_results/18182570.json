{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious, modern unit with contemporary finishes including sleek dark cabinetry, recessed lighting, and glass partitions, but the layout appears more commercial/office-like with large open spaces, extensive built-in shelving, glass room dividers, and bar-height seating rather than typical residential bedrooms. For baby safety, the glass walls/doors and hard tile floors throughout would need attention; the bathroom has an open wet-floor design. Natural light is decent from the large windows, and the space is clean and well-maintained."}
