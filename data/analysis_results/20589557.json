{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Luxury-styled apartment with ornate European-inspired decor, crystal chandeliers, marble surfaces, and high-end built-in wardrobes. The unit is in excellent, clean condition with modern AC units, recessed lighting, and quality flooring throughout. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), on floor 9 of 12 which strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the decorative ironwork and sharp marble/stone corners in the entryway would need attention, though bedrooms have soft-edged furniture and no visible stairs. Natural light appears moderate from curtained windows; only bedroom photos shown so common areas are not visible, which is a minor red flag for an 80K/month listing."}
