{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Modern high-rise building (18 floors) with sleek contemporary facade and well-equipped gym facility with treadmills and ellipticals, indicating a premium residential complex. The building appears to be a newer construction in excellent condition. However, only exterior and amenity photos are shown — no interior unit photos available, so baby safety details (balcony railings, sharp corners, flooring) cannot be assessed. The 8th floor unit in an 18-story elevator building is suitable for a family, but the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — request interior photos and a proper description before visiting."}
