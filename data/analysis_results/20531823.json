{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylishly furnished apartment with high-end finishes including dark hardwood floors, modern white cabinetry, and designer lighting. The open-plan layout with glass partitions between bedroom and living area looks upscale but the glass coffee table and sharp-cornered furniture would need baby-proofing. Good natural light from windows; kitchen is compact but functional with modern appliances. Being on floor 5 of 18 in Xinyi district strongly suggests elevator access."}
