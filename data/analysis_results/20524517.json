{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with marble accent walls, recessed lighting, and high-end finishes. The kitchen features built-in Bosch appliances and induction cooktop. For baby safety: there is a balcony visible in image 3 but railings appear adequate; the space has rounded furniture edges and no visible stairs. Good natural light from multiple windows. Clean and move-in ready condition with professional staging."}
