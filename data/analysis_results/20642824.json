{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white finishes, polished floors, and contemporary fixtures throughout. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light; the balcony has proper railings but would need baby-proofing for the sliding doors. The unit appears very clean with rounded furniture edges, though the hard tile floors and glass bathroom enclosure would require safety precautions for a crawling baby."}
