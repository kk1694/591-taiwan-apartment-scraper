{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with hardwood floors, recessed lighting, and split-unit AC. The unit has at least two bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. Baby safety concerns include the floor-to-ceiling windows/balcony doors which would need childproofing, and a large freestanding mirror in one bedroom that could tip over. The coffee table has sharp corners. Overall well-maintained condition in a high-rise building (12F) which virtually guarantees elevator access."}
