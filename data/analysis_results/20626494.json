{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a 2-story standalone house with older furnishings and dated wood paneling. The spacious living area has recessed lighting but furniture appears worn. For baby safety: this is a multi-level home with stairs between floors (not shown but implied by 1F/2F listing), which poses risks for a crawling baby. Natural light appears limited with small windows and heavy curtains throughout."}
