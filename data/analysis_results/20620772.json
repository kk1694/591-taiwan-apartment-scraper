{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment in a newer luxury building with glass balcony railings and secure gated entrance. Interior features sleek built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, central AC, induction cooktop, and glossy tile floors — all in excellent condition. For baby safety, the open-plan layout has smooth surfaces with few sharp corners, but the glass coffee tables and hard tile flooring would need padding; the balcony glass railings appear solid but should be verified for gap width. Natural light appears limited based on the narrow living room with curtains drawn, though the 4th floor position surrounded by greenery is pleasant."}
