{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "The listing description is essentially empty, containing only a generic promotional message for the real estate agent platform rather than any actual property details. At 15 ping (49.5 sqm) on the 2nd floor of a 5-story building, the size is reasonable for a small family but the low-rise building likely lacks an elevator. Without images or a substantive description, it is impossible to assess modernity, baby safety features, natural light, or overall condition — this listing is a red flag due to its lack of transparency."}
