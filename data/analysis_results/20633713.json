{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained modern apartment at 63 ping with upscale finishes including recessed lighting, decorative wallpaper, polished tile floors, and a large L-shaped kitchen with gas stove, range hood, and ample counter space. The living room is generous with large windows providing decent natural light, and the dining area has built-in cabinetry. For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery, the glass shelving in the dining area could be hazardous, and the balcony access from the living room would need a gate; the overall condition is clean and move-in ready, managed by HOYUAN Real Estate Agency which caters to foreign tenants."}
