{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near Taipei 101", "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment on 10F with high ceilings, large windows providing excellent natural light, and a clear view of Taipei 101. The unit is clean with updated furnishings including a sofa, large TV, double bed, built-in wardrobes, and a walk-in closet. Baby safety concerns: the loft/mezzanine bedroom with low ceiling suggests internal stairs to access it, which would be dangerous for a crawling baby and require gating; the glass coffee table has sharp edges. Overall a well-maintained unit in a prime Xinyi location, but the duplex/loft layout is not ideal for a family with a baby due to the staircase hazard."}
