{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment with dark hardwood floors and clean white walls in decent condition, though the style is dated (crown molding, older fixtures). The balcony has iron railings with wide gaps that are a serious baby safety hazard and would need netting or barriers. Good natural light from large sliding glass doors. At 4F/5F with no elevator info, carrying a stroller up stairs could be challenging. The listing description is just a generic agent ad with no real property details, which is a minor red flag."}
