{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "Clean, modern apartment listed through Elegant Realty (expat-friendly agency). Features include wall-mounted AC, leather sofa, bathtub, bidet toilet, front-loading washer, and gas water heater on the balcony. At 39 ping on 8F/15F in a newer building, it almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the balcony laundry area has railing but parents should verify height; the glass bathroom partition and bathtub edges are potential concerns. Natural light appears moderate from the windows shown; overall the unit is in good, clean condition with no major red flags aside from the limited description text which is just an agent ad template."}
