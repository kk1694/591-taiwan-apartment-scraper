{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "Spacious apartment with mixed-era finishes: polished marble tile floors in living area, hardwood in bedrooms, but older-style dark wood display cabinet and window-unit AC suggest a partially renovated older building. The raised platform step in the living room and the small second bedroom with built-in fold-down furniture are baby safety concerns. Natural light appears limited based on small windows visible in bedroom photos. The hallway exterior (image 5) shows an older building corridor with worn tile and the address number 32 on the door, confirming residential use. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag for transparency."}
