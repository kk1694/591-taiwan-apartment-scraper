{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with new light wood laminate flooring, track lighting, and modern AC units throughout. Clean white walls and good natural light from windows and skylights. The bathroom appears older with basic tile fixtures which contrasts with the renovated living spaces. For baby safety, there's a small balcony visible with standard railings that would need childproofing, and the raised platform/step in one room could be a tripping hazard. Overall spacious and well-maintained unit on a high floor."}
