{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or near-new building with modern stone/glass facade, gated underground parking, and track lighting inside. The interior is completely unfurnished with polished tile floors, multiple rooms visible, and appears to be on the 2nd floor of a 9-story elevator building. Major red flag: the unit appears to be a bare shell with exposed ceiling wiring/conduit and no kitchen or appliances — this may be intended as commercial/office space rather than residential, which explains the lack of layout info. For a couple with a baby, the hard tile floors and total lack of furnishing would require significant investment; the balcony railings on the building exterior appear adequately spaced but the interior needs full fit-out before being livable. A nearby elevated highway/overpass is visible from the street which could mean traffic noise."}
