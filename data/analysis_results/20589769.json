{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious renovated apartment with modern track lighting, light wood floors, and fresh neutral paint. Open floor plan is relatively baby-safe with no visible stairs or dangerous balconies, though the open shelving units have corners that would need childproofing. Natural light appears limited with small windows and security grilles; the space looks clean but has visible clutter and storage items scattered around."}
