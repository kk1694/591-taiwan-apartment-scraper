{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with high-end finishes including marble-look tiles, recessed lighting, crystal chandeliers, and quality LG appliances. The space appears clean with good natural light from balcony windows. For baby safety: the balcony has metal railings that appear safe, glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the polished tile floors may be slippery. Overall excellent condition with no visible red flags."}
