{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older style apartment with dated furnishings including heavy wooden furniture and leather sofas. The unit is on the 1st floor of an 11-story building with decent size at ~95 sqm. For baby safety, the horizontal metal bars near the entrance could be a concern, and some sharp corners on furniture would need protection. Natural light appears limited, especially in bedrooms with small windows showing condensation or frosted glass. The space is clean but feels somewhat dark and dated overall."}
