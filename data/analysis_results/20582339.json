{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with brand new furniture, recessed lighting, split AC units, and a clean minimalist design. The unit has at least 2 bedrooms with new bed frames and mattresses, a compact open kitchen with glass backsplash and dishwasher, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the large windows appear to have low sills which would need child-proofing, and one bedroom (image 4) shows metal security grilles on the window which is a plus; the coffee table has some sharp corners to watch for. The apartment is very clean and move-in ready, though the listing description is minimal (appears to be an agent placeholder ad), which is a minor red flag — verify actual terms directly."}
