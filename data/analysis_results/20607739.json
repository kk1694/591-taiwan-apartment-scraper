{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious luxury apartment with marble floors, high ceilings with decorative molding, split AC units, and excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. The balcony has protective mesh netting visible in the view photo which is good for baby safety; kitchen has a half-gate at entrance. Very clean condition but being unfurnished on 13th floor with balcony access means childproofing will be needed."}
