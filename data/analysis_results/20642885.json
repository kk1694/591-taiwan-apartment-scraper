{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white tiles, contemporary furniture, and stylish lighting fixtures including a decorative chandelier. Open floor plan with good natural light and spacious living/dining area. For baby safety: the coffee table has sharp corners that would need corner guards, and the hard tile floors may require area rugs; no visible stairs or balcony railings in this image. Overall very clean and move-in ready condition."}
