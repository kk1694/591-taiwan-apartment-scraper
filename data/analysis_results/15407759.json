{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with recessed LED lighting, contemporary furniture, integrated kitchen with dishwasher, and large windows providing good natural light. The view shows an elevated highway/overpass nearby which may cause noise. For baby safety, the balcony has glass railings visible in bedroom which would need childproofing; the space is open-plan with minimal sharp corners but the metal-framed dining chairs and glass elements require attention."}
