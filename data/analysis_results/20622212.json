{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end renovation with recessed LED lighting, light wood flooring, marble-look TV feature wall, built-in cabinetry, concealed ceiling AC, and sleek sliding glass wardrobe doors — appears brand new or recently renovated. The apartment looks very clean and well-maintained with a minimalist aesthetic; the balcony area has metal slat railings and a glass door which should be secured for baby safety, and the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. Natural light appears moderate — the bedroom window has roller blinds and the living room relies mainly on the balcony door for daylight; only 5 photos shown with no kitchen or bathroom visible, so layout details and full room count remain unclear despite the 25-ping size suggesting at least 2 rooms."}
