{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in very clean condition with new light wood laminate flooring, recessed LED lighting, modern grey doors, updated kitchen with gas stove, range hood, large sink, and Mitsubishi refrigerator, plus a modern glass-enclosed shower bathroom. The unit is unfurnished with spacious open rooms, AC units installed, and windows with security grilles and curtains. For baby safety, the flat single-level layout is good with no stairs, but the windows have wide sills that a toddler could climb and the glass shower door edges should be monitored; natural light appears moderate due to smaller windows with exterior iron grilles. Being on 2F of a 6-floor older walkup building, no elevator is likely, which would be inconvenient with a stroller."}
