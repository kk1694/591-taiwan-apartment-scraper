{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment on the top floor (13F) with warm neutral tones, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and light wood flooring. The unit appears very clean with high-end finishes including a cozy window seat with storage drawers and a low-profile sofa. For baby safety, the window seats are low enough for a crawling child to climb, and the glass-front upper cabinets could be a concern; however, no visible balcony, stairs, or sharp corners are apparent, and the natural light from the windows is excellent. Being the top floor may mean potential heat or roof leakage issues worth verifying, and only 4 images were provided so kitchen and bathroom condition are unknown."}
