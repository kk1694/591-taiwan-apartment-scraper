{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Modern, newly built apartment in an upscale low-rise building with elegant lobby, marble-clad hallways, elevator, and Japanese-style landscaped entrance garden. Interior is clean with wood-grain flooring, recessed lighting, AC, flat-screen TV, and minimalist furnishings. For baby safety, the unit appears to have no visible balcony access from interior photos, and furniture has rounded corners which is positive; however, the space looks somewhat compact for a family and natural light appears limited based on the interior shots (mostly artificial lighting visible). Building security and maintenance appear excellent with fire safety equipment visible in common areas."}
