{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylish modern apartment with designer finishes including wood accent wall, polished concrete floors, and a sleek white kitchen with island and high-end appliances. The balcony has adequate railings with mesh screening for baby safety, though being on 5F without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller. Excellent natural light throughout with floor-to-ceiling windows; very clean condition overall."}
