{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, hotel-style studio apartment in excellent condition with contemporary fixtures, LED lighting, sleek kitchen with induction cooktop, washing machine, and stylish furniture. The space appears clean and well-maintained with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows, but at 18 ping it is a compact studio with a sliding door separating the bedroom area — tight for a couple with a baby. Baby safety concerns include the hard tile/laminate flooring, the open kitchen layout with accessible appliances, and what appears to be a balcony behind the large window with curtains that would need childproofing; the sliding door track on the floor could also be a tripping hazard."}
