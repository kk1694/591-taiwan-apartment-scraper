{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with modern recessed lighting, split AC units, clean tile flooring, and a separated kitchen with glass sliding doors. The living room is large with matching furniture, and there are at least two bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and desks. At 15 floors the building almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the glass dining table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the tile floors are hard but easy to clean; no dangerous balcony railings or stairs are visible. Natural light appears moderate with curtained windows in every room."}
