{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Zhongzheng District, near a major intersection", "notes": "This is clearly a commercial/office space, NOT a residential apartment. Images show an open-plan office with desks, office chairs, monitors, industrial metal shelving, and exposed ceiling with track lighting — completely unsuitable for a family with a baby. The third image shows a busy urban intersection view from the 3rd floor. The description is essentially empty (just an agent advertisement), providing no useful listing details. This space should be skipped entirely as it is not a residential flat."}
