{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment in Xinyi with designer furniture (Ligne Roset Togo sofas), Noguchi-style glass coffee table, chandelier, recessed lighting, and hardwood flooring. The glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a concern for a baby; the balcony has secure metal grille/railing which is good for child safety. Only the living room and balcony are shown across all 5 images — no bedroom, kitchen, or bathroom photos are provided, which is a red flag. The description is essentially empty (just an agent advertisement), so very limited information is available about the actual unit."}
