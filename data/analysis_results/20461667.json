{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with recessed lighting, polished tile floors, and contemporary furnishings. The balcony has metal railings with relatively wide spacing that would need baby-proofing; sliding glass doors provide balcony access from both living room and bedroom. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows, and the unit appears well-maintained with a modern bathroom featuring glass shower partition. Being on floor 15 of 19 strongly suggests elevator access."}
