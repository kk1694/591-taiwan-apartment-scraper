{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with basic renovations - clean wood laminate floors but dated tiled bathroom/kitchen areas with old fixtures. The balcony has metal security grilles which are good for baby safety, but being on 4F with no visible elevator is a concern for strollers. Spacious rooms with decent natural light from multiple windows, though the service/utility area appears worn."}
