{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with light wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, minimalist white and wood-tone finishes, wall-mounted AC, and a spacious open-plan living/dining area. The flat layout with no visible stairs is baby-friendly, and the smooth rounded furniture and lack of sharp corners are positives; however, no bedroom or bathroom images are shown, and the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), so layout details and balcony safety cannot be assessed. The 14-story building on the 6th floor very likely has an elevator, and the unit appears clean and move-in ready with good natural light from the windows."}
