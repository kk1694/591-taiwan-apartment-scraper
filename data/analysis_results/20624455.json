{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly built apartment in excellent condition with stylish LED light fixtures, polished tile floors, LG refrigerator, built-in oven, gas stove, and a separated kitchen with glass sliding door. The balcony has glass panel railings on the 10th floor which are a significant baby safety concern — a child could potentially climb furniture near the sliding doors to reach the balcony, and the glass railing gaps at the base need childproofing. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows. The unit is very clean and move-in ready, spacious at 49 ping with 3 bedrooms suitable for a growing family."}
