{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Chongyang Road, Nangang District, near Nangang Software Park MRT Station (402m)", "notes": "Newly renovated duplex unit (14F-15F) in a 15-story elevator building with full furnishings including AC, fridge, washing machine, and natural gas cooking. The duplex layout with internal stairs between floors is a significant baby safety concern - stairs will need gating. Being on the top two floors provides good natural light. No pets allowed; managed by a broker with NT$2,700/month management fee and two months deposit. Close to MRT and shopping areas, which is convenient for a young family."}
