{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu, near hillside/mountains", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, split AC, and contemporary furniture. Spacious open-plan living/dining area with multiple bedrooms visible. The balcony on the 12th floor has metal-and-glass railings that are reasonably high but would need a baby gate or lock to secure the balcony door once the child is mobile. The glass coffee table has sharp corners worth noting. Excellent natural light from large windows with mountain/greenery views. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — ask the agent for full details on layout and lease terms."}
