{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylish loft-style apartment with high ceilings, modern industrial lighting, and clean wood flooring throughout. The space features an open-plan living/dining area with contemporary furniture, a well-equipped modern kitchen with island counter, and appears very clean and well-maintained. For baby safety: the open metal staircase/mezzanine visible in some photos would require safety gates, and the metal dining chairs have sharp edges to consider; otherwise good natural light from multiple windows."}
