{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "This is an older building top-floor (5F/5F) apartment with a mix of classic and updated furnishings. The living area features a distinctive domed skylight ceiling, hardwood floors, and a staircase suggesting a duplex/penthouse layout. Major baby safety concerns include the internal staircase with wooden railing (fall hazard), and the top-floor walkup with no elevator would be very difficult with a stroller and baby. The apartment has decent natural light from multiple windows with security grilles, at least two bedrooms, and appears clean and well-maintained despite the older building structure, but the sloped ceilings on the upper level reduce usable space."}
