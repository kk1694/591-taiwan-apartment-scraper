{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "天母泉宮大廈 (Tianmu Quangong Building)", "notes": "Older building complex with well-maintained courtyard and gated entrance. Interior shows dated but clean living space with hardwood floors, basic furniture, and split AC. Limited natural light with small windows. The building appears to be an older residential complex; no interior photos showing bedrooms, kitchen, or bathroom were provided, making full assessment difficult. Baby safety concerns include hard furniture corners on the daybed/couch unit."}
