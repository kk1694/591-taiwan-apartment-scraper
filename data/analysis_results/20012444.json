{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean finishes, LED cove lighting, wall-mounted AC, and a smart door lock system. The living room has a glass coffee table with sharp edges that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony has horizontal railings that could be climbable by toddlers - both are safety concerns. Good natural light from balcony windows; bathroom is clean with bathtub but small. The building appears to have an elevator based on the hallway view through the open door."}
