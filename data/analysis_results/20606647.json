{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with quality furnishings, track lighting, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. The space appears very clean with smooth tile flooring safe for crawling babies. One concern is the enclosed balcony windows which appear secure, but the decorative shelf mirrors in the bedroom could be a hazard if a child climbs; the unit appears to be in a newer high-rise building (5th of 14 floors strongly suggests elevator access)."}
