{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment in Da'an with upscale finishes including recessed LED lighting, marble-top coffee table, padded wall panels, dark hardwood bedroom flooring, and a separate kitchen with gas stove. The living area has smooth tile floors and the bedroom has a window seat with natural light. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the walk-in closet area leads to a narrow bathroom doorway; no visible balcony hazards in the photos. The 12-story building on floor 4 very likely has an elevator, and the overall condition is clean and move-in ready."}
