{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang", "notes": "Unfurnished apartment in a modern high-rise complex with a grand marble lobby, polished tile floors, large windows with good natural light, AC units, and a glass-enclosed shower bathroom. The balcony has solid brick-height railings which are reasonably baby-safe, but the sliding glass balcony door would need a child lock; the unit is completely empty so no sharp furniture corners to worry about, though the hard tile floors could be a concern for a crawling baby. The building appears well-maintained and in a newer residential development in Nangang; the listing description is minimal (just agent boilerplate) which is a minor red flag — layout details and exact room count are unknown."}
