The unit is very clean with a bright white color scheme, large sectional sofa, flat-screen TV, and a spacious bedroom with padded headboard and good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the glass sliding doors between living room and bedroom have no locks visible and the round coffee table on wheels could be a concern; however, the overall open layout with smooth floors is fairly baby-friendly.
