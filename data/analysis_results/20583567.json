{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "The apartment is clean and spacious with recently updated light-colored laminate flooring, but the kitchen and bathroom are dated with old tile and basic fixtures, giving it an overall semi-renovated feel. The living areas are mostly unfurnished open spaces with good natural light from large windows; the floor-to-ceiling windows lead to a balcony area that would need baby-proofing, and the step down between the kitchen tile and the main floor is a tripping hazard for a toddler. The kitchen appears very basic with exposed gas pipes and an old water heater, which is a safety concern for a family with a baby."}
