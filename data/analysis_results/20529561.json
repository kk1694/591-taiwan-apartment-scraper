{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). Clean minimalist design with LED ceiling lights, light wood flooring, fitted kitchen with microwave, large sofa, TV, and dining area with floor-to-ceiling windows offering good natural light and green views. The bedroom is compact but has a double bed and built-in wardrobe. For baby safety, the floor-to-ceiling windows in the kitchen/dining area are a concern and would need child locks; the layout is single-level with no stairs which is good. The 13-floor building on 4F almost certainly has an elevator. At 16 ping this is on the smaller side for a couple with a baby but is very well-maintained and in excellent condition."}
