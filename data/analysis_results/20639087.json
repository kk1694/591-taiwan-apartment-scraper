{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Songshan District, near Dunhua area", "notes": "This appears to be an office/commercial space rather than a residential apartment. The rooms have commercial-style drop ceiling with fluorescent grid lighting, exposed wiring, tile flooring, and no kitchen or bathroom visible - strongly suggesting office use. The balcony has low railings which would be a serious baby safety hazard. The space is completely unfurnished and bare with some wall staining, and the description is just a generic agent advertisement with no actual listing details. Red flags: likely office space being rented as housing, no visible residential amenities, and the very high price of NT$85,000 for this condition is poor value."}
