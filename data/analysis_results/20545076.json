{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Spacious 61-ping apartment with dated but well-maintained wood-tone interior from the 1990s-2000s era, featuring marble floors, extensive built-in wooden cabinetry, glass display cabinets, and recessed lighting throughout. The marble floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby, and the glass-fronted display cabinets with shelves pose a risk; the unit has decent natural light from gridded windows but the overall aesthetic is quite dated. The listing description is essentially empty (just a real estate agent ad placeholder), which is a red flag — no details on rooms, amenities, or terms, and at NT$52K for a 3F walkup with no confirmed elevator this needs further investigation."}
