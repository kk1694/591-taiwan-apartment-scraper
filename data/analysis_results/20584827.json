{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large, spacious unfurnished apartment on the top floor (4F/4F) of an older walkup building with no elevator — a significant concern for a pregnant woman and later carrying a baby and stroller. The unit has been renovated with wood-look laminate flooring, recessed lighting, and built-in cabinets, but still shows its age with window-unit AC, older-style glass doors, and exposed ceiling beams. Natural light appears limited with frosted glass on the balcony side; the space is very open-plan which is good for baby safety but the top-floor location with no elevator is a major red flag for a couple expecting a baby."}
