{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new, unfurnished modern apartment in a high-rise building (8F/26F) with pristine white tile floors, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, modern bathroom with glass partition, and a sleek kitchen with Whirlpool appliances and range hood. The unit appears to have multiple rooms with a balcony accessible via a glass door; balcony has metal railings which are good for baby safety, but the glass balcony door would need a child lock. The completely empty, clean condition with no sharp corners or stairs is excellent for baby-proofing, though you will need to furnish it entirely yourself."}
