{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious apartment with modern track lighting, recessed ceiling details, and light wood flooring throughout. The space is clean and well-maintained with multiple windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the large open floor plan is good but there are no visible barriers at the balcony/window areas with iron grilles, and the low furniture edges may need corner guards; the floors appear easy to clean and baby-friendly."}
