{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "Modern, recently renovated bedroom with recessed LED lighting, light wood flooring, built-in wardrobe with sliding doors, and a matching vanity desk. The room appears clean and well-maintained with zebra blinds on the window. At 34.38 ping this is a spacious unit on the 6th floor; no obvious baby hazards visible in this image, though only one room photo is available so balcony access and other rooms cannot be assessed. The listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — worth requesting more photos and details before visiting."}
