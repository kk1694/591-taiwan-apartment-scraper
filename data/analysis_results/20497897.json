{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Stylish loft-style (樓中樓) apartment with high-end finishes including wood flooring, designer lighting, white brick accent wall, Philips 70-inch 4K TV downstairs and 55-inch upstairs, LG washer-dryer combo, and Simmons luxury mattress. Major baby safety concern: the open mezzanine bedroom has metal railings that a toddler could fall through or climb, and the internal staircase has no gate — this would require significant baby-proofing. The balcony has good natural light and plants but railing gaps should be checked. Overall very clean and modern but the loft layout with exposed stairs and elevated sleeping area is not ideal for a family with a baby."}
