{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Near Nangang Software Park (南港軟體園區)", "notes": "The building exterior appears modern and well-maintained with 15 floors and balconies with sturdy railings. However, NO interior photos are provided — all images show only the building exterior and nearby Nangang Software Park landmark. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a significant red flag. Without interior photos, baby safety (sharp corners, balcony gaps, stairs) and apartment condition cannot be assessed. At NT$79,900/month for 49 ping in Nangang, this needs in-person verification before considering."}
