{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment in Da'an with recessed LED lighting, clean tile and hardwood floors, split AC, and a separate kitchen with gas stove. The unit has two bedrooms with good natural light from large windows, built-in wardrobes, and a furnished living/dining area. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, but overall the flat layout with no stairs is suitable; the 4th floor in a 12-story building very likely has an elevator."}
