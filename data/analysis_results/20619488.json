{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern light-wood cabinetry, glass kitchen backsplash, stainless steel appliances, and clean grey vinyl flooring. The spacious L-shaped kitchen and open dining area are well-designed. For baby safety, the dining table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the open shelving unit could be a climbing hazard; however, the flat single-level layout with no visible stairs is a plus. Good natural light from multiple windows with a high-floor city view; the apartment appears very clean and well-maintained, listed through Caster agency."}
