{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in near-new condition with high-quality finishes including wood-look flooring, recessed AC, built-in wardrobe system, and a sleek white kitchen with gas cooktop and built-in oven. The balcony has glass railings which are a baby safety concern—they are relatively low with horizontal rails a child could climb; the sliding glass doors to the balcony would need child locks. Natural light is good with large floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room and bedrooms; the unit is very clean and unfurnished aside from the master bedroom built-ins, making it spacious at 22 ping for a growing family."}
