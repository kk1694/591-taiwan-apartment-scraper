{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "This is a 38 ping (125.4 sqm) apartment on the 6th floor of a 16-story building in Da'an District, priced at NT$68,000/month. The building height of 16 floors strongly suggests elevator access. The listing description is minimal (only a promotional message for agents), providing no details about condition, layout, fixtures, or baby safety features such as balcony railings or stairs. Without images or a detailed description, modernness, natural light, and specific safety concerns cannot be assessed — an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
