{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wenshan District, near a park/green space", "notes": "This is a modern high-rise building (14 floors) with a very upscale lobby featuring designer furniture, marble floors, and high ceilings — indicating a luxury residential complex with elevator access. The balcony on the 9th floor overlooks a large park with mountain views and has glass railings which are a baby safety concern (glass panels appear solid but the railing height should be verified). No interior photos of the actual apartment unit were provided — all images show the balcony view, building exterior, and common area lobby — so the actual unit condition, layout, and baby-proofing needs cannot be assessed. Red flag: the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), and at NT$65,000/month for 55 ping in Wenshan this is a premium price, so interior photos should be requested before committing."}
