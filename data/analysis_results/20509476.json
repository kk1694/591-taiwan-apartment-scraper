{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with elegant fixtures including crystal chandelier, marble TV wall panel, and quality wood flooring. Excellent natural light through large floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. For baby safety: the coffee tables have rounded edges but the bar stools in the kitchen area are tall and unstable, and the balcony visible in images would need childproofing. Clean condition throughout with contemporary kitchen featuring induction cooktop and built-in appliances."}
