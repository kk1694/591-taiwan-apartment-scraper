{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Older but clean apartment with polished hardwood floors throughout, unfurnished with multiple rooms visible. The unit has an intercom system, AC units, and a balcony with sliding glass doors; the 16-story building on the 6th floor almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the balcony access with glass sliding doors needs childproofing, and there are no visible stairs or sharp corners of major concern, though the hard wood floors would benefit from play mats. Natural light is decent from multiple windows with blinds, but the bathroom appears dated and compact."}
