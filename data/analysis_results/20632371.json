{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Spacious and clean modern apartment on 8F/12F with large open-plan living/dining area, separate kitchen, and bedroom with dark hardwood floors. The unit has floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light with city views, split AC units, modern kitchen cabinetry, and a video intercom system at the front door. For baby safety, the large sliding glass balcony door will need child-proofing, and the tile-to-hardwood floor transitions and sharp-cornered coffee table should be noted; the overall flat layout with no stairs is favorable for a family with a baby."}
