{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in a high-end building with luxurious lobby and likely elevator access (4F/5F building with upscale amenities). Very spacious at 94 ping with contemporary finishes including track lighting, recessed AC, modern kitchen with stainless appliances, and light wood flooring. Good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: open floor plan is good but glass partition between kitchen/living may need attention; floor appears smooth with no visible stairs. Overall very clean and well-maintained premium unit."}
