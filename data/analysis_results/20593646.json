{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean white built-in cabinetry, light wood laminate flooring, recessed and cove lighting, digital door lock, modern kitchen with induction cooktop and built-in oven. The living area is spacious and open-plan with an attached kitchen; a separate room has a raised platform bed with wardrobe and window with natural light. For baby safety, the raised platform bed area has an elevated edge which could be a minor fall risk, and the kitchen is open to the living area so baby-proofing around the oven and cooktop would be needed. At 15F in a 20-story building, an elevator is almost certain. Overall clean, bright, and in excellent condition with no major red flags."}
