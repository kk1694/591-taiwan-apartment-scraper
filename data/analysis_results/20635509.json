{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Luxury modern unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, central air conditioning, polished tile floors, and designer wall panels. The unit is on 7F/11F suggesting an elevator building, and has multiple spacious rooms with large windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the highly polished tile floors could be slippery and would benefit from rugs or mats; no balcony railings or stairs are visible in the photos, and corners appear relatively clean with dark baseboards. The unit is completely empty/unfurnished so all furniture would need to be purchased, but the blank slate allows for full baby-proofing from the start."}
