{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylishly renovated apartment with a minimalist aesthetic featuring modern pendant lighting, new wood-look flooring, a Hitachi fridge, Heran microwave, split AC units, and designer furniture. The bedroom has a raised platform area near the window and open metal wardrobe frames with sharp edges that would need baby-proofing; the exposed concrete ceiling beams and industrial design elements give a trendy look but the raised platform in the bedroom could be a tripping hazard for a toddler. Good natural light from windows, very clean condition overall, and at 9F/12F the building almost certainly has an elevator."}
