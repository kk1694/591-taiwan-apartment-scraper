{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, upscale apartment with high-end finishes including designer ceiling details, stone accent walls, hardwood flooring, and built-in cabinetry. Spacious open layout with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp edges and the decorative wooden ladder shelf are concerns; the low platform bed area and raised window seating could also pose fall risks for a crawling/walking toddler."}
