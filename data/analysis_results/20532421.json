{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near ENT Clinic (鄭耳鼻喉科診所)", "notes": "Spacious older apartment with dated furniture and fixtures from the 1990s-2000s era. The building exterior shows age with an older brick facade. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, but the open floor plan provides good space for a crawling child. Natural light is limited due to small horizontal windows, and the overall condition appears clean but worn."}
