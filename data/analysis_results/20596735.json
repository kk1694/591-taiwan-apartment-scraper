{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed ceiling lighting, split AC units in multiple rooms, clean tile flooring, and at least two bedrooms with new plastic-wrapped mattresses. The bathroom has a bathtub which is a baby-safety concern requiring supervision; the balcony has metal railings with gaps that a toddler could potentially reach through, and the floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors in the bedroom open directly to the balcony. Good natural light through large windows in the living room and bedrooms. At 40 ping this is a spacious unit suitable for a family, though the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only) which is a minor red flag."}
