{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with a modern living room featuring stylish TV wall, recessed lighting, leather sofa, and polished tile floors. At least 3 bedrooms visible — two with updated laminate flooring and built-in storage, one older room with hardwood floors and basic wardrobe. Windows have security grilles which is good for baby safety, but the 3F walkup with no elevator will be challenging with a stroller and newborn. The living room has sharp-cornered furniture (coffee table, TV stand) that would need baby-proofing, and the smooth tile floors could be slippery for a toddler."}
