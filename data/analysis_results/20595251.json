{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with recessed lighting, split AC, large TV, open-plan living/kitchen, and at least two spacious bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and shelving. The unit is very clean with wood-look flooring throughout and good natural light from multiple windows. Managed by HOYUAN Real Estate Agency (foreigner-friendly). For baby safety, the coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but the low window sills in the bedroom and the glass balcony door in the kitchen area would need childproofing; no visible stairs or dangerous railings. At 30 ping in Da'an district on the 9th floor, this is a spacious and desirable unit, though the listing description is minimal (just a promotional blurb)."}
