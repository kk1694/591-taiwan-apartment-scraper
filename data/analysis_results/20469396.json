{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated dark wood furniture, marble tile flooring in living/dining areas and laminate wood in bedrooms. The unit is clean and spacious at 33 ping with at least two bedrooms, a separate kitchen, and a dining area. The glass coffee table in the living room and the balcony with metal railings visible in image 1 are baby safety concerns; the marble floors could also be slippery for a crawling toddler. Natural light appears decent from the 6th floor windows though some rooms rely mainly on artificial lighting. The window-type AC in one room and older ceiling finishes suggest this is a 1990s-era building that has been maintained but not renovated. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — further details should be requested directly."}
