{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in very clean condition with new marble-style tile floors, modern kitchen with gas stove and new cabinetry, and a modern bathroom with electronic bidet toilet. The unit is unfurnished with AC units installed. The enclosed balcony has high brick walls which is good for baby safety, but the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from play mats once the baby arrives. At 27 ping on the 7th floor of a 15-story building, this is a spacious and bright unit, though the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag worth clarifying."}
