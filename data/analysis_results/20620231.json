{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with stylish finishes including wood flooring, white brick accent walls, and contemporary furniture. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety: balcony visible with horizontal railings (may need childproofing), open floor plan with minimal sharp corners, but the open shelving units have edges that could be a concern for toddlers. Overall very clean and well-maintained condition."}
