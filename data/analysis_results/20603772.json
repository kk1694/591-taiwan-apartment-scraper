{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly housing rental service with Japanese text on watermark). Clean minimalist design with quality kitchen featuring modern range hood, stainless steel sink, and Panasonic appliances; living room has high ceilings with stylish pendant lights and floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the bedroom has floor-to-ceiling glass doors leading to what appears to be a balcony that should be checked for secure railings; the low platform bed and mostly rounded furniture are positive, but the glass coffee table edges and standing mirror in the hallway could be hazards. At 25 ping and on 4F of a 10-story building (very likely has elevator), this is a well-maintained, foreigner-friendly option at a premium price point."}
