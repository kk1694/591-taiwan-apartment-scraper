{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with traditional carved wooden furniture, wood flooring, and dated decor — clean but not modern. The unit is on the 4th floor of an 18-story building (likely has elevator). There is a balcony with sliding glass doors; the heavy wooden furniture has sharp corners on the coffee table and TV cabinet that would need baby-proofing. Natural light appears limited due to close neighboring buildings visible through the balcony. A separate kitchen is visible, and the space at ~54 sqm is decent for a couple with a baby, though the traditional Japanese-style sliding partition between rooms may not provide full sound isolation for a nursery."}
