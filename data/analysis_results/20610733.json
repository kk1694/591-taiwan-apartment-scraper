{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with stylish light blue accent walls, ceiling fan, AC, and a sleek modern kitchen with glossy white cabinets and gas stove. The spacious balcony has diamond-pattern railings which are reasonably safe but gaps could be a concern for a crawling baby; the bedroom opens directly onto the balcony via large sliding glass doors which would need childproofing. Excellent natural light throughout with floor-to-ceiling windows; being on the 5th floor of a 6-story walk-up means no elevator is likely, which would be difficult with a stroller and baby."}
