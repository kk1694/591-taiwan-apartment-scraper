{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean white walls, recessed lighting, digital door lock, and contemporary furnishings. The living area features stylish black-framed glass partition doors separating a dining nook, and the space appears bright and well-maintained. For baby safety, the metal-frame coffee tables have sharp edges that would need padding, and the glass partition doors could be a concern; however, the flat tile floors are easy to clean, there are no visible stairs, and the bedroom is simple with adequate space. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — further details on layout, lease terms, and utilities should be confirmed."}
