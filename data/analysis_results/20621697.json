{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Large, spacious apartment (55 ping) with dated 1990s-era decor including ornate ceiling medallion, crystal chandelier, black leather sofas, stone-accent fireplace feature, and heavy wood trim throughout. The unit is clean and well-maintained but the style is distinctly older Taiwanese luxury. The bedroom has good natural light with large windows and greenery outside, plus a balcony with tiled half-walls that appear adequately safe. For baby safety, the marble/tile floors are very hard and slippery, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, and the open kitchen doorway and multiple room transitions would need baby gates; the 2nd floor location with elevator access is convenient for a stroller."}
