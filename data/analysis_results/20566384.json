{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a furnished 1-bedroom apartment with sliding glass partition to the bedroom, a living area with sofa and TV, small kitchenette, and a basic wet bathroom. The unit appears reasonably clean but dated — the bathroom has older fixtures with a wet-floor design (no shower enclosure), and the kitchen is very compact with a gas stove near the sofa area. For baby safety, the glass sliding doors have sharp edges, the bathroom wet floor is a slip hazard, and there are no visible windows providing natural light — the space relies entirely on recessed ceiling lights, which is a concern for ventilation and daylight. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag for transparency."}
