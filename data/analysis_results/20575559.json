{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/retail space rather than a residential apartment. The main area has industrial track lighting, exposed white brick walls, and commercial-grade flooring with visible damage/missing tiles. The kitchen is old and dated with stained cabinets. The space is completely unfurnished and lacks residential amenities. Not suitable for a family with a baby due to the commercial nature and poor condition."}
