{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and well-furnished apartment with stylish wood-panel accent walls, recessed lighting, split AC units, and clean light wood flooring throughout. The layout includes a living area with sofa and dining counter, and a separate bedroom with large double bed, wardrobe, and vanity. There is a balcony accessible from both the living room and bedroom with glass sliding doors providing decent natural light, though surrounding buildings are close. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the balcony railings should be checked for gap spacing; the floor-level layout is otherwise relatively safe with no stairs. At 14 floors with this level of finish, the building almost certainly has an elevator."}
