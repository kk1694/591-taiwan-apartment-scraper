{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a well-maintained modern apartment with high-quality dark wood cabinetry, recessed lighting, and polished tile floors throughout. The spacious living area has good natural light from large windows, and the kitchen is fully equipped with gas stove, range hood, and modern appliances. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need protection, and cabinet handles are at crawling-toddler height; however, floors are smooth and easy to clean, and the open layout allows good visibility."}
