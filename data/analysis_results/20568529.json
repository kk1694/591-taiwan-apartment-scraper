{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Lavishly decorated apartment with ornate European-style baroque furniture including gilded chairs, crystal chandelier, and large mirrored walls — the style is opulent but dated rather than modern. The apartment is spacious at 48 ping with large windows behind heavy curtains, and features decorative glass partition panels; being on the 8th floor of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the ornate furniture has many sharp carved corners and edges, the large floor-level mirror panels could be a hazard, and the glass partition dividers are a concern; the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder) which is a red flag suggesting limited transparency about the property."}
