{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with stylish finishes including recessed lighting, marble-look coffee table, upholstered accent wall, and clean tile floors. The unit appears clean with good natural light in the bedroom. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the low windows in the bedroom may need securing; no visible balcony or dangerous stairs. Being on 4F of a 12F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
