{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with clean finishes, recessed lighting, and contemporary built-in cabinetry. The space appears baby-friendly with smooth tile floors, no visible stairs, and minimal sharp corners on furniture; the glass coffee table may need corner guards. Good natural light from large windows, separate enclosed kitchen with modern appliances, and overall excellent cleanliness. Being on 3F of an 11-floor building strongly suggests elevator access."}
