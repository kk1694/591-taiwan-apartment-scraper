{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment on 11F with dark hardwood floors, recessed lighting, modern kitchen with gas stove, large fridge, range hood, and granite countertops. The living room is spacious with large floor-to-ceiling windows and a balcony providing excellent natural light and city views. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, the balcony sliding doors need child locks, and the glass dining table edges are a concern; however the overall layout is open and flat with no stairs. The decorative mirrored wall panel in the dining area could also be a hazard if broken. Very clean and move-in ready condition at 58 ping — generous space for a family."}
