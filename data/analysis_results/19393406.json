{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, wall-mounted AC units, stylish pendant lighting, and a spacious open-plan living/dining area with 6-seat dining table. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the smooth tile floors could be slippery for a crawling baby. Good natural light from large curtained windows; the 14-floor building on 2F almost certainly has an elevator, and the unit appears well-maintained by Dingli Rental Service agency."}
