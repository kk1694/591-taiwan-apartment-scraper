{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed lighting, built-in wooden cabinetry, and polished tile floors. The balcony has proper metal railings which are good for baby safety; the floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors should be child-proofed. Excellent natural light from large windows. The unit appears newly renovated and very clean with no visible red flags."}
