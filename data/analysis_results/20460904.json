{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with excellent built-in wooden cabinetry, recessed lighting, and quality finishes throughout. Very clean with polished tile floors and good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety: the floor plan appears single-level with no visible stairs; furniture corners are rounded on built-ins; balcony access visible but railings not clearly shown - would need verification. Being on 12F in a 12-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
