{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with clean wood flooring, recessed lighting, chandelier, and built-in shelving in the bedroom. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and the freestanding full-length mirror in the bedroom are baby safety concerns; the Togo-style low sofas are actually baby-friendly. Large windows with curtains provide decent natural light, and at 9F/13F the building almost certainly has an elevator. The listing description is minimal (just agent boilerplate) which is a minor red flag — no details on layout, kitchen, or bathroom were shown in the photos."}
