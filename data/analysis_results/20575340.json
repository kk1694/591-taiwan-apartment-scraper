{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with new wood-look laminate flooring, modern black track lighting, fresh white walls, updated kitchen with new cabinets and range hood, and a fully retiled bathroom with new fixtures. The unit is unfurnished and very clean with a spacious open layout at 32.8 ping. For baby safety: the wet bathroom floor (no shower partition) is a slip hazard, the glass shelf in the bathroom could be a concern, but overall the open flat layout with no stairs and smooth flooring is baby-friendly. Being on the 3rd floor of a 4-story walkup building means no elevator, which will be challenging with a stroller and baby. Natural light appears moderate with small windows; the description is minimal (just an agent ad), so layout details and exact location within Da'an are unclear."}
