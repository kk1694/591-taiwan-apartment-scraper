{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Luxurious, high-end modern apartment on the 9th floor with designer furniture, recessed LED lighting, marble-textured TV feature wall, and light wood flooring throughout. Excellent natural light with large floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking greenery and city views. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and the arc floor lamp could be baby hazards, but no open balcony is visible — windows appear to be fixed panels, which is safer for a child. The building is clearly a modern high-rise in Da'an district and almost certainly has an elevator. Very clean and move-in ready condition with tasteful decor."}
