{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu, near Keelung River and Caihong Bridge (Rainbow Bridge)", "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern dark wood cabinetry, light laminate flooring, recessed ceiling lighting, and wall-mounted AC. The living area is spacious and clean with a balcony accessed via sliding glass doors with glass railings — the balcony railing height appears adequate but glass panels should be checked for sturdiness with a toddler. The 12th floor of a 14-story building almost certainly has an elevator. The view from the balcony shows the Keelung River and the distinctive red Caihong Bridge, confirming the Neihu riverside location. Only the living room and entryway are shown — no bedroom, bathroom, or kitchen photos are provided, which is a minor red flag; the listing description is also minimal (just an agent ad), so an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
