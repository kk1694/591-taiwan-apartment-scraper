{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean wood-tone finishes, recessed lighting, ceiling fan, and a fully equipped kitchen with gas stove, range hood, dish dryer, and large refrigerator. The living room has tall floor-to-ceiling windows with a sliding glass door to a balcony providing good natural light; balcony railing appears adequate but the glass door should be baby-proofed with a lock. Children's toys visible on the floor suggest the previous tenant had a child, which is a positive sign for family-friendliness. The bedroom has a frosted glass interior window and floor-to-ceiling window with curtains. Being on the 5th floor of a 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access; the intercom panel visible in the entryway also indicates a modern managed building. Overall a clean, safe space for a family with a baby, though the metal-frame coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding."}
