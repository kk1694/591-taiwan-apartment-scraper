{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment with hardwood floors, ceiling-mounted AC, and good natural light from large windows. The furniture and decor appear dated (older style sofa set with musical note pattern, marble-top coffee table). For baby safety, the main living area appears open with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings, but the sharp corners on the marble coffee table would need protection. Clean and well-maintained condition overall."}
