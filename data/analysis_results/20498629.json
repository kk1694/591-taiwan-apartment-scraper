{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Da'an District, near a major intersection", "notes": "This appears to be a bare commercial or office space rather than a residential apartment. The unit is completely empty and unfurnished with industrial fluorescent lighting, dark vinyl flooring, scuffed/stained walls, and no visible kitchen or bathroom fixtures. Walls show signs of wear with visible marks, exposed wires, and peeling paint. For a couple expecting a baby, this is unsuitable — it would require full renovation to become livable, has no natural light beyond a small balcony door with bars, and the overall condition is poor for the NT$58,000 price point in Da'an."}
