{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a converted commercial/warehouse space rather than a standard residential apartment — it has exposed metal roofing, corrugated metal walls, industrial-style stairs, and a ground-floor storefront-style entrance with large glass doors. The space has been partially renovated with new flooring and paint but retains an industrial character. Major baby safety concerns include the steep enclosed staircase to a mezzanine level, lack of proper railings, and the overall non-residential layout. Not recommended for a couple with a baby as this is essentially a repurposed shop/studio space, not a proper flat."}
