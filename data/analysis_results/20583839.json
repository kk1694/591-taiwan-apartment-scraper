{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District, near Tianmu/Beitou area", "notes": "Well-maintained spacious apartment with modern built-in cabinetry, hardwood floors, open-plan living/dining/kitchen layout, AC units, and decorative Tiffany-style pendant lights. The glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a baby safety concern, but the open floor plan is good for child supervision. Being on the top floor (8F/8F) is a concern if no elevator exists, and potential roof heat/leak issues; windows provide good natural light with views of green hills, but the description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag."}
