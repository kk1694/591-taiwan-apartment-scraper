{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with elegant finishes including marble flooring, crystal chandeliers, and high-quality wood laminate in bedrooms. Excellent natural light from multiple large windows. For baby safety: the bathroom has a glass shower enclosure and bathtub which would need supervision; the open-plan layout has minimal sharp corners but the elevated bed platform edges should be padded. Very clean condition with spacious living areas."}
