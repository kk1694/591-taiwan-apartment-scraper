{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern fixtures, LED cove lighting, split AC, video intercom, and a modern enclosed kitchen with built-in appliances. The balcony has glass railings which are a concern for baby safety as a toddler could potentially climb and fall - would need additional safety measures. Very clean with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows, and being on 10F of a 15F building strongly indicates elevator access."}
