{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with open-plan living area, stylish kitchen with breakfast bar, and at least 2-3 bedrooms with hardwood floors. The apartment is clean with modern fixtures, recessed/track lighting, and air conditioning. Baby safety considerations: the balcony visible in bedroom 3 has railings that appear adequate, glass coffee table has sharp corners, and bar stools near the kitchen island could be a climbing hazard. Good natural light in bedrooms with windows."}
