{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, recently renovated apartment with modern white kitchen featuring stone countertops, new cabinetry, gas stove, and range hood. Spacious living area with tile flooring, AC, and balcony access with secured railings and sliding glass doors. For baby safety, the balcony has metal grille railings which are good, but the sliding glass balcony doors would need child locks; the tile floors are easy to clean but hard if a baby falls. The 8th floor in a 15-story building very likely has an elevator. Good natural light from multiple windows, overall very clean and well-maintained condition with minimal furnishing."}
