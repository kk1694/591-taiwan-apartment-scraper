{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with light wood laminate flooring, recessed LED cove lighting, and clean white walls throughout. The living room is spacious with large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light, and a bedroom features corner windows with horizontal security grilles which are good for baby safety. Being on the 13th floor of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access; the flat open layout with minimal sharp corners is relatively baby-friendly, though the balcony sliding doors would need child locks once the baby is mobile."}
