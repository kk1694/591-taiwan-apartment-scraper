{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "怡園 (Yi Yuan) building, Da'an District", "notes": "Older but well-maintained apartment in a 7-story building with elevator (confirmed in lobby photo). Very spacious living area (~38 ping) with classic parquet wood flooring, textured ceiling tiles, and dated light fixtures suggesting 1980s-90s construction. The balcony has metal grill railings which are good for baby safety, and sliding glass doors provide decent natural light; however the hardwood floors may be slippery, and the minimal furnishing means sharp corners on existing furniture (piano, dining table) would need baby-proofing. The building exterior and common areas appear clean but aged, and the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request a proper walkthrough to check kitchen, bathrooms, and bedroom conditions not shown."}
