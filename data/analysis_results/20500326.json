{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Guandu Bridge, Beitou, overlooking Tamsui River", "notes": "Large 100-ping renovated apartment/villa with stunning river and mountain views overlooking Guandu Bridge. Interior has been recently updated with modern grey wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, and clean white walls; living room furnished with traditional wooden furniture and a glass coffee table. Major baby safety concerns: the property has an outdoor swimming pool with a slide (serious drowning hazard), balcony railings appear to be classical balustrade style at moderate height, and the glass-top coffee table has sharp corners. Excellent natural light from large bay windows; bathroom is spacious with a clawfoot bathtub. The description is minimal (just an agent advertisement), which is a minor red flag—further details on layout, number of rooms, and lease terms should be confirmed."}
