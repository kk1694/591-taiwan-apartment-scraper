{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with high-quality built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, designer pendant lights, and polished tile floors throughout. The unit is unfurnished and spotlessly clean with a sleek open kitchen featuring modern white cabinets and black backsplash. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery and would need rugs; no balcony or stairs are visible which is positive, but the large window area should be checked for secure locks. Natural light appears moderate from curtained windows; listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) suggesting it is foreigner-friendly. The description is minimal (just an agent promotion), so layout details and bathroom/bedroom count are unknown despite the generous 30-ping size."}
