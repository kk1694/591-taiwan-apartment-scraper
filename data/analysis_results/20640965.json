{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with modern furnishings including split AC, intercom system, and updated white kitchen cabinetry with full appliances. The living room is spacious with good natural light; one bedroom has a balcony with metal railings that appear to have wide gaps which could be a baby safety concern. The second bedroom is an interior room with no window, and the bedroom with the balcony door should be secured with a child-proof lock once the baby is mobile."}
