{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Changchun, Siping commercial area (四平商圈), Zhongshan District", "notes": "This is NOT a residential apartment — it is a 1F commercial storefront (店面) currently operating as a Korean restaurant (gimbap shop). The listing text explicitly says '公寓1樓店面' (apartment building 1F storefront) with 'open layout' (開放式格局). Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby as it is a commercial retail space with restaurant fixtures, dining tables, menu displays, and kitchen equipment. Red flags: misclassified as residential, high price for what may be a lease transfer of a restaurant business."}
