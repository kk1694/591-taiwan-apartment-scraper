{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "The listing description is essentially empty, containing only a generic advertisement for the agent's listing package rather than any property details. At 29.64 ping (97.8 sqm) on the 2nd floor of a 7-story building priced at NT$48,000/month, the size is generous for a family. Without images or a meaningful description, it is impossible to assess baby safety features, natural light, condition, or modernity — this listing is a red flag as the lack of details may indicate an agent placeholder or bait listing."}
