{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white tile flooring, built-in walnut-toned cabinetry, recessed lighting, wall-mounted TV, and split AC units. The spacious 62.6 ping layout on the 9th floor of a 14-story building (very likely has elevator) offers good natural light through large windows with a balcony visible outside. For baby safety, the balcony railing spacing should be checked in person, but the flat open floor plan with no stairs and smooth tile floors is generally baby-friendly; corners on the low TV cabinet cubby openings are worth padding."}
