{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, marble-look floor tiles, modern white kitchen cabinets, and AC units. The unit appears to have at least two rooms plus a living area and bathroom. For baby safety, exposed electrical conduits run along the ceiling and walls, and the bathroom door opens directly into the living area without much separation. Natural light seems limited with only one visible window in a side room. The listing description is minimal (just a promotional message), which is a minor red flag — no details on lease terms or amenities. Being on the 5th floor of a 7-floor building with no clear elevator indication, it may be a walk-up, which would be difficult with a stroller."}
