{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious Da'an apartment at 48 ping with clean light wood flooring, built-in cabinets, and a large open living area. The building exterior appears dated (1990s-era brown tile facade) though the interior has been reasonably maintained with recessed lighting and wall-mounted AC. For baby safety, the interior looks good with no visible stairs or sharp corners, and windows appear to have low sills that would need childproofing; natural light is moderate from the horizontal strip windows but not abundant."}
