{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with modern kitchen (induction cooktop, glass backsplash), air conditioning, and recessed lighting. Clean condition overall but bedroom shows some wall moisture stains and limited natural light with only a small window. Baby safety concerns include glass coffee table with sharp corners and cluttered spaces; the 5th floor location without confirmed elevator access could be challenging for parents with a stroller."}
