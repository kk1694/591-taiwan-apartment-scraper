{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious high-floor apartment in good condition with modern fixtures including split AC, recessed lighting, and hardwood floors. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light with mountain views. For baby safety, the balcony has glass and metal railings that appear adequate height, but the glass coffee table with sharp corners would need baby-proofing; no stairs visible in images."}
