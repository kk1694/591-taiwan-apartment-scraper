{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment with double-height windows, wood laminate floors, white kitchen with Hitachi fridge, and good natural light overlooking a river. Major baby safety concern: the mezzanine/loft level has an open railing overlooking the lower floor and internal stairs without gates, which pose serious fall risks for a crawling baby or toddler. The low mezzanine ceiling height may also be uncomfortable for tall adults. Overall clean and well-maintained condition."}
