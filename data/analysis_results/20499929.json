{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment in excellent condition with sleek wood-grain flooring, white gloss kitchen cabinets, glass backsplash, modern bathroom with glass shower partition and rain shower head. The apartment has a balcony with floor-to-ceiling sliding door that could be a concern for baby safety and would need a gate; furniture corners on the dining table and desk are sharp and would need padding. At 25.6 ping on the 6th floor of a 7-story building in Zhongzheng district, it likely has an elevator; the unit is clean, well-lit with recessed lighting, and appears move-in ready with multiple rooms including a small study/second bedroom."}
