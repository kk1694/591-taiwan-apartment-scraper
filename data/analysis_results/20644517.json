{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "An-Ho area (Xinyi)", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including marble-look wall tiles, crystal chandeliers, and sleek white cabinetry. Excellent condition with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling balcony doors. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that may need padding, and the balcony has metal railings that appear safe but the glass sliding doors should be secured. The kitchen is compact but modern with gas stove. Very clean and well-maintained, suitable for a family."}
