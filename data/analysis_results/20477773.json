{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). The unit features sleek light wood flooring, recessed lighting, a large flat-screen TV, modern sofa and furniture, a glass-enclosed bathroom, and a built-in window seat with good natural light from large windows on the 11th floor. The coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, but overall the flat layout with no stairs is safe for a crawling baby. The unit appears very clean and well-maintained, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent promotion), so details about layout and included amenities should be confirmed directly."}
