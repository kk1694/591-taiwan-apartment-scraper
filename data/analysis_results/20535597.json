{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with wood-look flooring throughout, modern kitchen with clean white cabinetry, and an upscale marble-tiled bathroom with bathtub and smart toilet. Excellent natural light from large windows in both living room and bedroom. For baby safety, the glass coffee table in the living room has sharp metal edges that would need childproofing, and the open sink plumbing in the bathroom is exposed; the balcony door in the living room appears to have secure framing. At 45 ping on the 12th floor of a 15-story building, this is a spacious, high-quality unit almost certainly in an elevator building, with a robot vacuum included — a clean and comfortable choice for a growing family."}
