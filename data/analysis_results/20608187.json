{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou, near mountains", "notes": "Spacious and clean modern apartment on 18th floor with recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, AC units, and a well-appointed bathroom with bathtub and glass-enclosed shower. Excellent natural light and mountain/greenery views from large windows in living room and both bedrooms. For baby safety: the floor-to-ceiling windows in bedrooms have balcony access that would need childproofing, the glass shower partition and hard tile bathroom floor are slip risks, and the wooden furniture has some sharp corners; windows appear to have security bars on smaller openings which is positive. The listing description is minimal (agent promotion text only), which is a minor red flag — confirm room count and lease terms directly."}
