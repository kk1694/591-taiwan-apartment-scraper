{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with clean finishes, recessed lighting, and quality built-in cabinetry throughout. Good natural light from windows with zebra blinds. For baby safety, the layout appears single-level with no visible stairs, and furniture has rounded edges, though the glass shower enclosure and low window sills would need baby-proofing measures."}
