The space is exceptionally clean with light wood flooring and neutral tones. For baby safety, the low platform beds and sharp-edged metal shelving units would need child-proofing, but no dangerous balconies or stairs are visible. Natural light appears adequate through curtained windows in multiple rooms."}
