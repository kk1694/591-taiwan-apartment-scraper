{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, clean white walls, light tile and wood flooring, central AC, and a fully equipped open kitchen with washer, oven, and microwave. The unit has a spacious living room, a separate bedroom with wardrobe and vanity, a dining area near a large sliding glass door leading to a balcony—the balcony railing appears to be standard height but would need baby-proofing for the sliding doors; the coffee table has some sharp corners to watch. The building appears to be a modern high-rise (digital intercom panel visible, 5F/10F suggests elevator), managed by HOYUAN Real Estate Agency, with decent natural light from the large windows though city views suggest nearby buildings."}
