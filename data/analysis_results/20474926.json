{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious duplex apartment (visible staircase in images 2-3) managed by UR HOUSE, a foreigner-friendly rental agency. The unit appears to span two levels with a living room featuring older terracotta tile flooring and a raised platform area on the lower level, while the upper level has more modern wood flooring, recessed lighting, and a dining area. Baby safety concerns include the internal staircase between floors, the raised platform with sharp edges in the living room, and exposed wiring near the TV area. The apartment has good natural light from multiple large windows on a high floor (9F) with city views, and the bedrooms are reasonably modern, but the mixed condition (older tiles downstairs vs renovated upstairs) and the duplex layout with stairs make it less ideal for a family with a baby."}
