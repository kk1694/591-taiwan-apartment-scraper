{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-quality modern apartment with sleek built-in cabinetry, wood floors, and contemporary fixtures. Major baby safety concern: there are internal stairs between split levels which would require gating. Good natural light through large windows, clean condition with modern kitchen appliances including induction cooktop and washing machine. The coffee table has sharp glass corners that would need baby-proofing."}
