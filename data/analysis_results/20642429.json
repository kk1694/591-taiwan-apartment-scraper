{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and recently renovated apartment with light blue walls, wood-look laminate flooring, recessed lighting, and modern furnishings including a large sofa and TV stand. At 31 ping on the top floor (4F/4F) of a walk-up building with no elevator, carrying a stroller and baby up four flights is a significant concern. The open layout is baby-friendly with smooth floors and no visible stairs inside, though the window grilles provide good safety; glass partition doors between rooms may need baby-proofing, and the sharp-cornered coffee table and dining table should be padded."}
