{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern dark wood cabinetry, polished tile floors, and recessed lighting throughout. The glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a concern for a crawling baby; the large windows with zebra blinds provide good natural light. Being on the 1st floor of a 4-story building means no elevator needed, but ground floor may have less privacy and potential for street noise or dampness."}
