{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Shilin, near 宏億車業 (motorcycle shop)", "notes": "This is a street-level commercial storefront (店面) in an old 3-story building, NOT a residential apartment. The images clearly show a glass-fronted shop space with blinds, track lighting, office desks/computers inside, and a street-facing shopfront with a roll-down shutter. The 'for rent' banner says '黃金店面 1樓~3樓' (prime storefront floors 1-3). The building is aged with dirty exterior walls, exposed wiring, and worn condition. Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby — this is a commercial space, not a dwelling."}
