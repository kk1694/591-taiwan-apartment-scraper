{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). Features wood laminate flooring, modern kitchen with induction cooktop and stainless sink, wall-mounted AC units, and matching light wood furniture throughout. The 15-story building on 2F almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the unit appears single-level with no stairs, windows have security grilles, and corners are mostly rounded furniture; low electrical outlets near the bed are a concern to cover. Natural light is moderate with windows in the living room and bedroom, though the 2F position and nearby buildings may limit direct sunlight. The listing description is minimal (just an agent advertisement), which is a minor red flag — confirm layout details and whether it's a true 2-bedroom at this size."}
