{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). The unit features stylish pendant lighting, a sleek grey kitchen with built-in appliances, leather sofa, dining area, and a spacious bedroom with ample built-in wardrobes and split AC. Baby safety concerns include a glass coffee table with sharp edges in the living room and a balcony door visible in the bedroom that would need childproofing; the floor-to-ceiling windows appear to have proper railings. Good natural light from multiple windows, very clean condition, and on the 11th floor of a 15-story building which almost certainly has an elevator."}
