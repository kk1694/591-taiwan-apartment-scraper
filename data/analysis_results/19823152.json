{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern fixtures, clean white/grey color scheme, built-in cabinetry, AC units, and a loft area with vertical bar railings. The loft railings pose a potential baby safety concern as a climbing child could fit through or climb the vertical bars. Limited natural light from small windows; apartment appears very clean but somewhat compact despite the listed size."}
