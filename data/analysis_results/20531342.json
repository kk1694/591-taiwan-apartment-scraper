{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern 1-bedroom apartment with white minimalist decor, built-in wardrobes, wall-mounted AC, washing machine, kitchenette with microwave, and an en-suite bathroom. The glass coffee table has sharp edges which is a baby safety concern, but the flat layout with no stairs is good; the low bed frame is relatively safe. Natural light appears limited based on curtained windows, and the overall space feels compact but well-maintained for a couple with a baby in Zhongshan district on the 9th floor of a 15-story building (very likely has elevator)."}
