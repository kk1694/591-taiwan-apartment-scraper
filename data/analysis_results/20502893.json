{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older unfurnished apartment with dated tile floors, ceiling fans, and brown baseboards. The unit is spacious (58.4 ping) and empty, with a large living area, enclosed balcony with washing machine, and a rear utility balcony with gas water heater; the balconies have security grilles which is good for baby safety but the overall condition is aged and would need furnishing. Decent natural light from the front sliding doors, but the description is just an agent ad with no real property details, which is a minor red flag — the low price for this size in Shilin suggests an older walk-up building without elevator (2F/7F)."}
