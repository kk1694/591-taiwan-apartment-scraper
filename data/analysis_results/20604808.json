{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with stylish modern finishes including marble-effect TV wall, recessed lighting, wood-tone flooring, and upholstered bedroom headboard wall. Kitchen is compact but equipped with washer, large Panasonic fridge, and cooktop. For baby safety, the low open TV console shelves and small dining area with hard-corner wooden furniture would need childproofing; no balcony or stairs visible which is a plus. Natural light appears limited to the bedroom windows; the living area relies heavily on artificial lighting, suggesting an interior-facing or narrow-frontage unit."}
