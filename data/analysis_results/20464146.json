{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean but dated apartment in a 17-floor building in Da'an district. The unit features older-style wallpaper, basic ceiling light fixtures, and wall-mounted AC units typical of 1990s-2000s Taiwanese apartments; tile floors are polished but the overall aesthetic is not modern. Windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, sliding balcony door in the living room has a low threshold to watch for with a crawling baby, and the hallway is narrow but the rooms appear spacious at 37 ping with multiple bedrooms. The listing description is minimal (just a promotional ad for the agent platform), which is a minor red flag — more details about the actual unit would be expected at this price point."}
