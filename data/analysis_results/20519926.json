{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a shared apartment with multiple small bedrooms - the rooms shown are very compact with single beds, suggesting this may be a room-rental situation rather than a full apartment. The kitchen is dated with older cabinets and appliances. For a couple expecting a baby, this is likely unsuitable due to the small room sizes, shared living arrangement, and limited space for a nursery. Natural light appears limited based on the curtained windows."}
