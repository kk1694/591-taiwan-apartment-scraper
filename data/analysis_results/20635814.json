{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with high-end marble accent walls, recessed LED cove lighting, modern split AC, video intercom, and a well-equipped galley kitchen with gas stove and stainless steel appliances. The unit is on the 1st floor, which is convenient for a family with a baby (no stairs needed), and the living room has a sliding glass door to a small balcony/patio area with metal railings that appear secure. Being a ground floor unit, natural light may be limited as seen in the bedroom window which faces close to neighboring structures; the tile floors are smooth and easy to clean but could be slippery for a toddler learning to walk."}
