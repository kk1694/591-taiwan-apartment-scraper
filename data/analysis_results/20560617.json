{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/warehouse space rather than a residential apartment - features industrial corrugated metal ceiling, exposed pipes, storefront-style glass door entrance at street level, and very basic finishes. The space is completely unfurnished with bare walls showing signs of wear. Not suitable for a family with a baby due to its non-residential nature, lack of proper living amenities, and the industrial character of the property."}
