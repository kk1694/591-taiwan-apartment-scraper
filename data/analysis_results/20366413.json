{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Luxuriously renovated modern apartment on the top floor (10F) with high-end finishes including marble kitchen island, designer lighting, glass partition walls, and dark wood cabinetry. The unit is very clean with excellent natural light from large windows on multiple sides. For baby safety, the open kitchen island with bar stools and sharp marble countertop edges are concerns; the large glass sliding partitions should be checked for safety film, and the top-floor location with windows that appear to open could need child locks. Overall a premium, move-in-ready unit in excellent condition with a dedicated entrance vestibule and study area."}
