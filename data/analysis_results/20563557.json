{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with a large living room featuring polished tile floors, recessed ceiling lighting with LED accents, built-in TV cabinet, and a leather sectional sofa. The bedroom has warm hardwood flooring with a desk, wardrobe, and bed. At 36 ping on the 6th floor of a 12-story building, it very likely has an elevator. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need padding, and the glass-front display cabinets should be secured; the open floor plan in the living area is otherwise spacious and good for a crawling baby. No balcony or stairs visible in the photos, which is a plus for safety."}
