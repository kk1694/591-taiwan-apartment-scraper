{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, light wood flooring, and updated kitchen with stainless steel appliances. Excellent natural light with mountain views from enclosed balcony area. For baby safety, the space appears relatively safe with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings, though being on 5F/5F without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller."}
