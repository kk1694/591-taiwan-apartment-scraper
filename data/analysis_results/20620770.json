{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment in a large high-rise complex backed by hills in Wenshan district. Interior features modern recessed lighting, split AC, polished tile floors, built-in cabinetry, glass dining table, and a decorative wallpaper accent wall. The balcony has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors with metal railings that appear adequate but would need baby-proofing; the glass-top dining table has sharp corners that pose a risk for a crawling child. Good natural light from large windows with mountain views; overall clean and move-in ready condition."}
