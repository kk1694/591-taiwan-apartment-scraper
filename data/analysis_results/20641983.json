{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with high-end minimalist design, recessed LED lighting, modern kitchen cabinetry, large TV, and clean light-toned finishes throughout. The 15-story building on floor 4 almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the balcony door with sliding glass appears secure, but the raised platform/tatami area with sharp edges and the industrial-style articulated wall lamp with exposed metal arms could be hazards; no visible balcony railing details. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreign-friendly agency), which is a positive sign, though the description is minimal (just an agent ad) and at 21 ping for NT$68,000 the price is on the higher side for Zhongshan."}
