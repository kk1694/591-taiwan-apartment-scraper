{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, unfurnished apartment in a decent older building with elevator access and tiled floors throughout. The balcony has safety netting/cables installed which is good for baby safety, though the unit appears completely empty and would need full furnishing. Natural light is adequate from multiple windows but one bedroom side faces an adjacent building under construction/renovation (blue scaffolding visible), which could mean noise and reduced light; the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag suggesting minimal landlord engagement."}
