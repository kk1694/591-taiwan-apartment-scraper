{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated furnishings including heavy leather sofas, dark wood cabinets, marble-pattern tile floors, and a traditional altar/shrine. The bathroom is small and aged with yellowed toilet and basic fixtures. The bedroom has window-unit AC and a piano but limited space. For baby safety, the hard marble floors throughout are a concern for falls, and the bathroom lacks a proper shower enclosure. The unit is spacious at 50 ping but feels cluttered and would need significant cleaning and baby-proofing. Natural light appears limited based on the window views showing close neighboring buildings."}
