{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious but dated apartment with older fixtures including 80s-90s style lighting and kitchen cabinets. The unit is clean and unfurnished with good natural light from balcony windows that have security grilles. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling security mesh which is a positive, and the tile floors are smooth without raised thresholds; however the kitchen has open lower cabinet handles at child height and electrical outlets are positioned low on walls."}
