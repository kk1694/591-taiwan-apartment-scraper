{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with updated fixtures including AC, washing machine, and new furniture. The space appears very clean with polished tile floors, but the bedroom is quite small and natural light is limited (glass block window in living area). For baby safety, the raised platform storage area and small spaces between furniture could be concerns; no visible balcony or dangerous railings. The industrial-looking utility panels in living room are unusual for a residential unit."}
