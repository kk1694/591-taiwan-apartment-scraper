{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with high-quality finishes including polished tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in shelving, and two clean bathrooms (one with bathtub). Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings that would need childproofing; the glass shower doors and hard tile floors throughout are potential concerns. Overall very clean and well-maintained property in a 15-story building."}
