{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed lighting, clean white tile floors, and updated kitchen with stainless steel appliances. The space is bright and features a balcony with sliding glass doors. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, and the bar stools are unstable for toddlers; the balcony access needs childproofing, but overall the single-level layout is good for a family."}
