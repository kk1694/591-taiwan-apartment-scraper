{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Spacious 18-ping apartment on 10F/13F with decent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows and balcony access. The unit is clean but dated — older-style built-in TV wall with gold trim, aging AC units, and a mix of tile and wood laminate flooring suggest early 2000s finishes. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings visible in image 5 that would need childproofing, and the glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners; the sliding partition between rooms has a raised floor track that could be a tripping hazard. Listed through Berlin Real Estate (柏林不動產) agent; the description is essentially empty (just an ad for the agent platform), which is a minor red flag — request full details on lease terms and actual layout directly."}
