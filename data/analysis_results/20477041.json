{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with clean tile floors, recessed/cove lighting, built-in kitchen with washing machine, and a stylish open-plan living area with wood-panel accent walls. At 4F/13F, the building very likely has an elevator. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp-edged coffee table are minor concerns, and natural light appears limited with small windows facing nearby buildings; no balcony is visible in the photos which reduces fall risk but limits ventilation."}
