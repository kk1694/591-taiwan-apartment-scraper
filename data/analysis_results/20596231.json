{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Huajiang Bridge, riverside area", "notes": "Modern high-rise building with upscale lobby and elevator. View overlooks the Tamsui River and Huajiang Bridge area. Limited interior photos shown - only a window area with good natural light visible. The building appears well-maintained with granite finishes. No interior layout visible to assess baby safety concerns; would need to verify room layouts and balcony railings in person."}
