{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern, professionally renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed lighting, white brick accent wall, split AC, and quality finishes throughout. Spacious living room, dining area with stylish furniture, and a well-appointed bedroom with large windows and curtains. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and the glass shelving/display unit near the dining area are baby safety concerns; the floor is smooth tile in living areas and wood-look in the bedroom, both easy to clean. Being on 6F/6F (top floor) with no elevator info is a potential concern for carrying a stroller, and the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag."}
