{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment in excellent condition with sleek built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, and contemporary finishes throughout. The living room has floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light, and there's a balcony visible which may need childproofing. The glass coffee table has sharp edges and low height which could pose risks for a crawling baby; the kitchen appears clean with an induction cooktop which is safer than gas."}
