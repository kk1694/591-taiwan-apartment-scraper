{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "This is a well-maintained modern high-rise building with an upscale marble lobby, rooftop deck with city/river views, gym with pool table, and clean tiled hallways. However, all 5 images show only building common areas (lobby, exterior, rooftop, gym, corridor) with zero photos of the actual apartment interior, which is a major red flag — the unit's condition, layout, natural light, and baby safety cannot be assessed. The listing description is also essentially empty (just an agent ad), and the contact is a broker named Jeff, so this appears to be an agent-listed placeholder rather than a genuine detailed listing."}
