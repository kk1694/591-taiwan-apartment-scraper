{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and well-renovated apartment with high ceilings, contemporary marble accent wall, recessed lighting, and stylish fixtures. The kitchen is fully equipped with modern appliances including induction cooktop and washer. For baby safety, the glass railings above the living room wall (appears to be a loft/mezzanine) could be a concern and would need gates; the open TV console shelves and lower cabinets may need childproofing. Good natural light from kitchen window, overall very clean condition."}
