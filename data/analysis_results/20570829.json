{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious unfurnished apartment with high-end finishes including marble floors, crystal chandeliers, recessed lighting, and built-in cabinetry. The spacious living area features large curved windows with blinds providing good natural light. For baby safety, the hard marble/tile floors may need rugs, and the low platform bed frame in the bedroom has sharp edges to be mindful of. Overall in excellent clean condition suitable for a family, though fully unfurnished requiring all furniture."}
