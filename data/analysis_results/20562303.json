{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very well-renovated modern apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). Clean, bright living room with leather sofas, large TV, modern dining area, and a well-equipped galley kitchen with large Japanese-style fridge, gas stove, and microwave. Bedroom has a balcony with security grilles (good for baby safety on 12F) and good natural light. The large standing mirror in the dining area and glass coffee tables could be tipping hazards for a crawling baby. Being on 12F/12F (top floor) may mean potential roof leak or heat issues; no elevator info visible but a 12-story building in Xinyi likely has one."}
