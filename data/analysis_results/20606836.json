{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean light wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, and contemporary furnishings including a leather sofa and wall-mounted TV. The space is spacious and open with good natural light from large windows, a separate kitchen area, and at least one bedroom visible. For baby safety, the coffee table has metal legs with sharp corners that would need padding, and the low 2F floor means windows should be checked for secure locks; no dangerous balcony railings are visible. Overall excellent condition and very clean, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — verify actual terms directly."}
