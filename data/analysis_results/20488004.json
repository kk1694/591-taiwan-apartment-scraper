{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylishly renovated studio with loft sleeping area, glass railings, LED accent lighting, LG fridge, washer/dryer, induction cooktop, and large TV. Major baby safety concern: the loft bed has only low glass panels as barriers with no proper railing height for a crawling/toddler-age child, and the ladder/stairs to the loft are open and unprotected. The space is clean with decent natural light from zebra blinds, but quite compact for a couple with a baby despite the 20-ping listing — it appears to be a single open-plan studio which would be very tight for a growing family."}
