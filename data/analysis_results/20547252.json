{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious older-style apartment (69.5 ping) with dated decorative ceiling medallions, ornate front door, old window-unit AC, and rattan furniture. The marble tile flooring in the living area and laminate wood flooring in bedrooms are in reasonable condition but the overall style is 1990s-era. For baby safety, the balcony areas visible through sliding glass doors need inspection for railing height and gaps; the large open floor plan with smooth tile could be slippery for a crawling toddler. Natural light is decent from multiple windows and balcony access on the 6th floor, but the unit feels somewhat bare and would need significant furnishing."}
