{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment in excellent condition with recessed LED lighting, central air conditioning, polished white tile floors, and dark-framed windows throughout. At 39.7 ping on the 13th floor of a 14-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator. The unit appears to have at least 3 rooms (spacious living room plus two bedrooms) and one room with a floor-to-ceiling sliding glass door leading to a small balcony — the balcony railing appears adequately high but should be verified in person for baby safety. The floors are very slippery polished tile which could be a concern for a toddler; no stairs visible inside. Mostly unfurnished with minimal furniture (bed frames only), giving flexibility to baby-proof. Good natural light from large windows on multiple sides."}
