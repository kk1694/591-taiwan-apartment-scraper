{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Neihu Technology Park (內湖科技園區) and Neihu Lishan Elementary School (內湖麗山國小)", "notes": "Modern unfurnished apartment on 11F/13F with clean white walls, tile flooring, floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room, and good natural light. The unit has at least a master bedroom, a second guest room, and a hidden bathroom, with views of Neihu Tech Park and nearby mountains. The living room has a glass-railing balcony which is a baby safety concern once the child is mobile — glass panels appear solid but height should be verified in person; the apartment appears clean and in good condition with no visible red flags, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder)."}
