{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, light wood laminate floors, recessed lighting, and built-in white cabinetry. The high-rise building (7F/22F) appears well-maintained with gated entrance. For baby safety: no visible balcony access in photos, rounded cabinet corners, but exposed electrical outlets near floor level would need childproofing. Apartment is unfurnished and very clean with good natural light from large windows."}
