{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern, spacious apartment with clean white minimalist design, recessed lighting, glass partition walls, and polished tile floors. The unit is on 8F/14F suggesting a modern elevator building. The open-plan living and dining area has good natural light from large windows; the kitchen is well-equipped with modern white cabinetry. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, the folding metal dining chairs have pinch points, and the large glass partition panels could be a concern — but the flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus. The hard tile floors are very slippery, which is a consideration for a crawling baby."}
