The bedroom is nicely furnished with a double bed and good natural light through large curtained windows. There is a balcony accessible via sliding glass doors which would need a child safety gate; the coffee table has sharp metal corners that pose a baby safety risk. At 4F/18F in a modern high-rise, the building almost certainly has an elevator. Listed through Miller House agency; the description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), so layout details and kitchen/bathroom condition are unknown."}
