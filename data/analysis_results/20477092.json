{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older townhouse-style unit with traditional furniture and dated fixtures. Interior stairs with no railings pose a significant baby safety concern, and the exposed gas tank on the outdoor terrace is also hazardous. The unit has decent natural light from windows and an open layout, but the building appears to be a 2-story walk-up with no elevator, which could be challenging with a stroller."}
