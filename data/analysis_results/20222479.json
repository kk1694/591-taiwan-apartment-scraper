{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "隆美禮御 (Longmei Liyu building), Datong District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated European-style 2BR/2LR/1BA apartment in a relatively new building (approx 7.9 years old, 12-floor building with elevator). The interior features elegant wainscoting, crystal chandeliers, marble accents, hardwood flooring, and a clean modern finish. For baby safety, the living room appears to have sharp-edged marble coffee table corners that would need padding, and the glass-paned French doors could be a concern; however, the overall layout is flat and open with no visible stairs. Natural light may be limited as photos show mostly artificial lighting and the unit faces a street; the listing includes 1 balcony which was not shown in detail."}
