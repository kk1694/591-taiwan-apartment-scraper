{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-furnished apartment with white European-style decor, two bedrooms, a living area with white leather sofa, kitchenette with washing machine, and a bathroom. The unit is very clean with good natural light from large windows in both bedrooms. For baby safety, the glass sliding doors between living room and bedrooms have low thresholds which is good, but the marble-top coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding; the tile floors are hard and slippery. Being on the 7th floor of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access. The description is minimal (agent listing with no real details), which is a minor red flag — would need to confirm layout and actual size in person."}
