{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/office space rather than a residential apartment - note the emergency exit signs, industrial exposed ceiling, track lighting, and open floor plan typical of offices. The space has raw concrete ceilings with visible conduits and pipes, suggesting it's unfurnished or being used as a studio/office. Not suitable for a family with a baby due to the non-residential nature and lack of proper living amenities like kitchen, bedroom separation, or bathroom visible in the images."}
