{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment in excellent condition with pristine white tile flooring, recessed LED lighting, designer TV accent wall, and a fully fitted U-shaped kitchen with gas hob, range hood, microwave, and dishwasher. The unit has abundant natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows on multiple sides with balcony access; the balcony railings appear to be glass panels which would need baby-proofing with guards. The spacious open layout at 64.5 ping is very family-friendly, though the glossy tile floors could be slippery for a toddler and corner protectors would be advisable on the built-in cabinetry. The building appears to be a modern high-rise (3F/11F) which almost certainly has an elevator, and the unit is unfurnished, allowing the couple to set it up safely for a baby."}
