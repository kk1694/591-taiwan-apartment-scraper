{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with herringbone wood-look flooring, recessed LED lighting, smart TV, split AC, and stylish pendant lights. The unit has two bedrooms visible through doorways with blinds, a kitchenette area with microwave and fridge, and a spacious open-plan living/dining area. For baby safety, the low sofa and rounded side table are positive, but the lack of visible natural light is a concern — windows appear to have heavy blinds and no direct daylight is shown, suggesting limited ventilation or an interior-facing unit. At 2F with no elevator in a 5-floor walkup, carrying a stroller up stairs daily will be inconvenient."}
