{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "派樂地 (Paradise) building, Neihu District", "notes": "Modern high-rise building (派樂地/Paradise) with clean, well-maintained interiors featuring white tile floors, split AC, digital door lock, and video intercom. The apartment is sparsely furnished with basic items—living room has good natural light from large windows, but bedrooms appear small and use freestanding clothing racks instead of proper closets, which could be a storage concern with a baby. No visible balcony hazards or sharp corners; the flat layout on the 4th floor of an 11-story elevator building is convenient, though the minimal furnishing means you would need to baby-proof and add furniture yourselves."}
