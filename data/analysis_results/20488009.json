{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with stylish finishes including wood laminate flooring, modern furniture, split AC, and contemporary lighting. The space is clean with good natural light from large windows with balcony access. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the balcony door should be secured; overall the open floor plan is relatively baby-friendly with no visible stairs."}
