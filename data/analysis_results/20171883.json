{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Brand new or near-new unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with pristine polished tile floors, modern kitchen cabinetry, AC, and a high-end bathroom with bathtub, glass shower partition, and stone vanity. At 14F/24F in a modern high-rise, it certainly has an elevator. For baby safety: the balcony has decorative iron railings with gaps that could be a concern for a toddler, the polished tile floors are very slippery which is a fall risk, and the apartment is completely unfurnished so you would need to baby-proof from scratch. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with city views; very spacious at nearly 80 ping. The listing description is minimal (just a sales pitch for the agent platform), which is a minor red flag — confirm room count and lease terms directly."}
