{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated studio apartment with pristine marble-look tile floors, recessed LED lighting, modern kitchen with microwave and stainless steel counters, and a clean updated bathroom with glass-enclosed shower. The unit is on 6F of a 15F building, almost certainly with elevator. For baby safety, the balcony has decorative metal railings with wide gaps that would need childproofing, and the highly polished tile floors could be slippery; the open studio layout with no separate bedroom means limited space separation. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling balcony doors, but at 18.9 ping this is a studio which may feel tight for a couple with a baby."}
