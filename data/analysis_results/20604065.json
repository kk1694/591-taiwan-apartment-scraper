{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "The listing description only contains a generic promotional message for real estate agents and lacks any actual property details, photos, or description of the apartment itself. At 24 ping in Xinyi District for NT$55,000/month, this appears to be a reasonably sized residential unit on the 4th floor of a 12-story building. Without images or a real description, it is impossible to assess baby safety features, natural light, condition, or whether there is an elevator — this listing is a red flag as it may be a placeholder or bait listing."}
