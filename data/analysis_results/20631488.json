{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older duplex/maisonette apartment with internal stairs connecting two levels, which is a significant baby safety concern as the staircase has metal spindle railings that a toddler could squeeze through or fall from. The unit shows signs of age with yellowed walls, water stains near the AC units, and dated window-type air conditioners. Natural light appears limited with small windows, and the overall condition is fair but not well-maintained."}
