Floor plan shows spacious 3-bedroom layout with open living/dining area, separate kitchen, and multiple balconies. Being on 9F with balconies requires baby-proofing railings; the building appears well-maintained with good city views. Location is convenient near MRT but view shows adjacent elevated highway which may cause noise."}
