{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated boutique-hotel-style apartment in excellent condition with high-end built-in kitchen (induction cooktop, integrated fridge), stylish walnut cabinetry, large TV, and designer furniture. The space appears very clean and well-maintained with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the bar-height stools near the kitchen counter could be a tipping hazard, and the low coffee table has sharp corners; no balcony or stairs are visible which is positive. At 19 ping with only a living area and one bedroom visible, it may feel tight once baby gear is added, and the description is sparse (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag—confirm actual layout and terms directly."}
