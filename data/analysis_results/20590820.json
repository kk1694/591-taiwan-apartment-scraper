{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with a stylish bohemian-industrial design, featuring wood flooring, rattan pendant lights, ceiling fans, and abundant natural light from large windows on the 14th floor. Baby safety concerns include a raised platform/step area in the living room with under-lighting that could be a tripping hazard, open shelving with accessible decorative items, and a balcony visible through glass doors that would need childproofing. The space is very clean and well-maintained but the description is minimal (just an agent promotion), and being on the top floor (14F/14F) may mean potential roof leak or heat issues."}
