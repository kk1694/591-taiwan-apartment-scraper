{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with new wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, modern AC units, and stylish minimalist furniture. Very clean and spacious open layout with good natural light from windows. For baby safety: the space is single-level with no visible stairs or balconies in photos, and furniture has rounded edges; the main concerns would be the low TV stand and exposed electrical outlets that would need covers."}
