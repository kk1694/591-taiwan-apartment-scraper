{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and split AC. Spacious open layout with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: no visible stairs or balcony access in photos, rounded design elements, but some sharp corners on the accent wall panels that may need padding. Kitchen is functional with gas stove and modern cabinets. Being on 8F of a 12-floor building strongly suggests elevator access."}
