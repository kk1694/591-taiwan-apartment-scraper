{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Brand new or nearly new unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes throughout — polished tile floors, recessed LED lighting, sleek wood-grain doors, modern white kitchen with gas stove, range hood, and marble-look wall tiles. The 27-story building on the 11th floor almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are very slippery, there are no visible balcony access concerns from the photos, and the unit appears to have no stairs; the dark baseboards have slightly sharp edges but are low-risk. Large windows in every room provide good natural light, and the unit is completely empty and clean — listed through Elegant Realty (上品房屋), an expat-friendly agency."}
