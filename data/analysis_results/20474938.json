{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Luxurious, high-end apartment with modern designer finishes including recessed LED ceiling lighting, large leather sofas, crystal chandeliers, polished marble floors, and hardwood flooring in the bedroom. The unit is spacious at 65 ping with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows; managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). For baby safety, the very slick polished marble/tile floors could be slippery, and the balcony visible in image 4 has railings that should be checked in person; sharp corners on the glass TV console and dining furniture would need padding. The 13-floor building almost certainly has an elevator, and the 2F location is convenient."}
