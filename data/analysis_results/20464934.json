{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with contemporary fixtures including track lighting, modern kitchen with dark cabinetry, and updated AC units. The space is clean with a minimalist aesthetic and appears to have two bedrooms. For baby safety, the furniture has relatively rounded edges and the unit is on the 4th floor of a 12-story building (likely has elevator). Limited natural light visible in bedroom windows. The wire-frame coffee table and fire extinguisher placement may need attention with a crawling baby."}
