{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment with double-height ceilings, stylish pendant lighting, and clean white tile floors on the lower level. The bedroom is on a mezzanine level accessed via steep open-tread stairs with metal railings and built-in storage drawers — this is a significant baby safety concern as the stairs are steep, open-sided, and the mezzanine likely has only low glass/metal railings. Good natural light from large windows with city views, and the unit is clean and well-furnished with a walk-in closet area, but the loft layout with stairs makes it poorly suited for a family with a baby or toddler."}
