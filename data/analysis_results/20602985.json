{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and polished tile floors. The living area is very clean with a large L-shaped leather sofa and ample open space. Windows have security grilles which add child safety but the coffee table has sharp metal corners that would need baby-proofing. Good natural light from multiple windows; overall a comfortable family apartment."}
