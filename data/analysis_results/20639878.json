{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated wooden furniture, tile floors throughout, and window-unit AC in the bedroom (split AC in smaller room). The unit is spacious at 57 ping with a living room, at least two bedrooms, a full kitchen with Hitachi fridge and gas stove, and a wet bathroom. For baby safety, the tile floors are slippery, the bathroom has no separation between wet and dry areas, and the low window sills in bedrooms could be a concern once the child is mobile. The apartment is clean but clearly from the 1990s era with no modern renovations; the furniture and fixtures show their age."}
