{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern studio/1-bedroom with clean wood laminate flooring, wall-mounted AC, and built-in seating area with storage. Good natural light from large windows with balcony access. For baby safety: the raised platform seating could be a fall hazard, and the exposed pipes near the ceiling are industrial-style but out of reach. Clean condition overall, appears recently renovated. Being on 5F of a 15F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
