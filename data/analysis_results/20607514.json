{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious apartment (51 ping) in Da'an with renovated living areas featuring light wood-look flooring, track lighting, and built-in storage, but the kitchen is dated with old tile counters and the rear utility/laundry area is rough and unfinished with exposed pipes. Being on 2F of a 6-floor older building it almost certainly has no elevator; window security grilles are present throughout. For baby safety, the large open floor plan is a plus, but the rear utility area with its uneven flooring and exposed elements would need to be secured, and the older kitchen has sharp-edged counters and open cabinet drawers that pose risks."}
