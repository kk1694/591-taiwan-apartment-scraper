{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with bright white interiors, updated kitchen with gas stove and full cabinetry, modern bathroom with glass shower partition and electronic toilet. The unit is on 6F of an 18F building, strongly suggesting elevator access. Managed by UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a foreigner-friendly rental agency with Japanese service. For baby safety, the tile floors are smooth but slippery, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the glass shower door should be monitored; no visible balcony hazards in the photos. Good natural light from large curtained windows in living room and bedrooms."}
