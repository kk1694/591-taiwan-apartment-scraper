{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated furnishings including heavy wooden TV cabinet, glass-top coffee table, round marble dining table, and vintage light fixtures — all typical of 1980s-90s Taiwanese decor. The unit is spacious at 32 ping with tile flooring throughout, decent natural light from windows, and a tree-lined street view from the 6th floor. Baby safety concerns include the glass coffee table with sharp corners, the enclosed but cluttered rear balcony/laundry area with buckets and metal drying racks, and no visible child-proofing on low electrical outlets. The overall condition is clean but decidedly not modern; the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag suggesting a broker listing with minimal effort."}
