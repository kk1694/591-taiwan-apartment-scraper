{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Very modern, new-construction apartment on the 14th (top) floor with recessed LED lighting, cove lighting, polished tile floors, video intercom, and a minimalist kitchen with refrigerator. The unit is extremely clean and in excellent condition with large windows providing abundant natural light and city views. For baby safety, the windows appear to have secure frames without accessible balconies, and the open floor plan has no stairs or sharp corners, though the slippery polished tile floors could be a concern for a crawling toddler. Being on the top floor of a modern high-rise, an elevator is virtually certain. The listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), so layout details and bathroom/bedroom count are unclear from these 5 images alone."}
