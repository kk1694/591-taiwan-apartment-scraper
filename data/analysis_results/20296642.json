{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious and well-maintained unfurnished apartment with polished marble flooring in living areas and wood flooring in bedrooms, recessed lighting, and a modern green-accented kitchen with full cabinetry and refrigerator. At 84 ping on the 6th floor of a 14-story building (almost certainly has elevator), this is a premium unit with abundant natural light from large windows; the marble floors could be slippery for a crawling baby but the open layout and lack of visible stairs are positives. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly agency), the unit appears clean and move-in ready, though it is completely unfurnished so all baby-proofing and furniture would need to be arranged by the tenant."}
