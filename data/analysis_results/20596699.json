{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older unfurnished apartment with dated orange tile flooring, old-style window-unit AC, and an aging kitchen with exposed gas stove and worn tile backsplash. Windows are small and high-set (jalousie/louvre style), suggesting limited natural light; being on 6F of a 7F building with no elevator info is a concern for carrying a stroller. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and exposed gas burners in the kitchen are risks, though the flat layout with no stairs is a plus. The completely empty, bare-bones condition and very minimal listing description (just an agent promotion message) are red flags suggesting low landlord engagement."}
