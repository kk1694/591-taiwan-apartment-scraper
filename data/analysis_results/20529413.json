{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style duplex with high ceilings, contemporary furnishings, and good natural light. MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN for a baby: the open floating staircase has minimal glass railings and gaps between steps that pose a serious fall hazard - would require gates at top and bottom. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with AC units in both floors."}
