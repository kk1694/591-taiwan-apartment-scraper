{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious apartment with traditional/older-style furnishings and decor. The hardwood floors are well-maintained but the overall style is dated with older kitchen cabinets and traditional wooden furniture. For baby safety, the open floor plan is good but the tile-to-wood floor transitions and furniture with sharp corners may need childproofing. Natural light appears limited with small windows visible. No visible balcony hazards in these images."}
