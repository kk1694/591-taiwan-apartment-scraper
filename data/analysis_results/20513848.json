{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and clean apartment with modern furnishings including recessed lighting, AC units, and contemporary furniture. The balcony has proper railings visible through sliding glass doors, and the flat has no visible stairs - good for baby safety. Multiple windows provide natural light, though the unit shows some clutter in the utility/storage area. At 44 ping this is a large family-suitable space on floor 5 of 14, strongly suggesting elevator access."}
