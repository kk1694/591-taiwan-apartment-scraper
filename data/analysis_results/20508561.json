{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with elegant finishes including crystal chandelier, recessed ceiling lighting, and quality wood flooring. The spacious living area has floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. For baby safety, the large glass balcony doors and low coffee tables may need attention; furniture corners appear rounded. The unit is on the top floor (7/7) which may mean no elevator in older buildings - confirm before viewing."}
