{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang", "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with recessed lighting, wood-panel TV wall, leather recliner sofa, and stylish accent wall in the bedroom. The space is clean, spacious at 50 ping, and appears to be in a newer high-rise building (6F/12F, very likely has elevator). For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp metal edges, the open metal shelving unit could be a tipping hazard, and the large windows have low sills that would need childproofing; no visible balcony which is a plus. Good natural light from large windows, overall excellent condition with no red flags, though the listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only)."}
