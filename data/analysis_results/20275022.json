{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with European classical-style decor featuring ornate furniture, crystal chandeliers, crown molding, and marble-like tile floors. The glass-top coffee table with sharp ornate legs and hard tile flooring are baby safety concerns; the kitchen has a gas stove without visible child locks. Good natural light from large windows with sheer curtains, and the unit appears very clean. Listed through Dingli Rental Service agent; the description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout, bedrooms, and whether an elevator is available for the 5th floor."}
