{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated studio-style apartment with modern minimalist design, white glossy kitchen cabinets, gas stove, stainless steel fridge, split AC, track lighting, and a glass-partitioned bathroom. Excellent natural light from multiple windows with security grilles. For baby safety, the open-plan layout has no stairs but the exposed pipes on the ceiling and the glass partition between the living area and bathroom could be concerns; the folding metal chairs have pinch points. At 14.3 ping this is a compact open studio which may feel tight for a couple with a baby, though the clean condition and 5th floor in a 14-story building (likely has elevator) make it practical."}
