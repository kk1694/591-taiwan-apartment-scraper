{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, recently renovated unfurnished apartment with white tile floors, modern AC units, and dark wood trim. The unit is completely empty with at least 3 rooms visible, a bathroom, and a spacious main living area — good size at ~96 sqm. Being on 2F of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety: the hard tile floors would need rugs/padding, but there are no visible stairs, balconies, or sharp corners, which is positive. Natural light appears limited based on photos (only one zebra blind window visible), and the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — worth confirming layout and window situation in person."}
