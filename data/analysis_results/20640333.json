{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and recently renovated apartment with clean white tile and hardwood flooring, modern recessed and pendant lighting, built-in TV console, dining area, and AC units. Multiple rooms visible including at least two bedrooms and a large living area with good natural light from large windows. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). For baby safety, the raised tatami/platform areas in bedrooms have step-downs that would need gating, and some rooms appear mostly unfurnished with open space which is good. Being on 5F/6F with no elevator confirmed could be difficult with a stroller and baby gear. The listing description is minimal (just an ad for agent services) which is a minor red flag — verify details directly with the agent."}
