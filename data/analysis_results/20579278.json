{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment on 5F/5F (top floor, likely no elevator in a walk-up building) with dated parquet-style vinyl flooring, old window-unit ACs, and an aging kitchen with worn cabinets and gas stove. The unit is spacious at 42 ping and unfurnished with decent natural light from sliding glass doors and windows; the balcony has low metal railings which are a safety concern for a crawling baby. Being a top floor walk-up is a major drawback for carrying a stroller and baby daily, and the ceiling shows some water stain marks suggesting possible past leaks from the roof."}
