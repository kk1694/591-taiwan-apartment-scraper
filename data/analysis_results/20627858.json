{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated apartment in excellent condition with marble-look porcelain tile floors, modern white gloss kitchen with induction cooktop, glass backsplash, and stylish marble-finish bathroom. The unit is unfurnished with at least two bedrooms and good natural light from large black-framed windows. For baby safety, the balcony has vertical metal railings with narrow spacing which is decent, but the sliding balcony door should be secured; the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from soft mats. Being on the 5th floor of a 7-story building with no elevator info is a concern for stroller access. Overall a very clean, brand-new-feeling unit at a fair price for Zhongzheng District."}
