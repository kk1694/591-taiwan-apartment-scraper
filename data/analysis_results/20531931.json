{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment with high ceilings, contemporary furnishings, recessed lighting, and clean white tiles. The space appears well-maintained with good natural light from tall windows. Baby safety concerns include the visible loft/mezzanine area with metal railings that may need childproofing, and the open staircase (partially visible) leading to upper level. Overall clean and stylish but the duplex layout requires extra childproofing attention."}
