{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including herringbone tile backsplash, LED cove lighting, Panasonic AC, and a well-equipped L-shaped kitchen with gas stove. The bedroom has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors opening to a small balcony on the 6th floor, which is a baby safety concern and would need a childproof lock; the coffee table has sharp corners worth padding. Natural light appears limited in the living area (windows face close neighboring buildings) but the bedroom gets better light. Overall very clean and move-in ready, though at 14 ping it may feel tight for a couple with a baby and the description is a generic agent advertisement providing no useful property details."}
