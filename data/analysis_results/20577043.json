{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious luxury apartment with high-quality marble and wood flooring, recessed lighting, AC units in multiple rooms, and modern kitchen with refrigerator. Excellent natural light through large windows with balcony access. For baby safety, the balcony railings appear to be glass/low visibility from photos and would need verification; the polished marble floors could be slippery. Overall very clean and well-maintained condition."}
