{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Brand new or newly renovated apartment in excellent condition with pristine white walls, polished tile floors, modern split AC units, a full kitchen with gas stove, range hood, microwave, and ample cabinetry. The unit is completely empty/unfurnished with at least 2 bedrooms plus living area, and features a balcony with solid dark brick-style railings at a safe height — good for baby safety, though the balcony door access would need a child gate. The space is very clean with good natural light from windows and the balcony; no visible red flags, though the slippery polished floors could be a concern for a crawling baby."}
