{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment in Da'an with clean white tile floors and freshly painted walls, but dated fixtures including window-unit AC, older light fixtures, and dark wood trim throughout. The unit is spacious and unfurnished with good natural light from large balcony sliding doors. For a couple expecting a baby, the hard tile floors and open layout are easy to clean but slippery; the balcony sliding doors and iron security grates on the rear windows should be checked for child safety, and the dark wood door frames have some sharp edges worth noting. At 2F with no elevator info, stroller access could be manageable but should be confirmed."}
