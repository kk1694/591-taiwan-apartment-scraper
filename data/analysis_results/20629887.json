{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with high-end marble accent walls, recessed LED cove lighting, marble-look floor tiles, and split-type AC. The unit is on 1F with a private covered outdoor corridor/patio area, which is great for stroller access but the metal bar chairs have sharp edges and the sliding glass doors to the patio would need child locks. The space is very clean and bright but only 5 photos were provided with no kitchen/bathroom/bedroom views, which is a red flag — the description is also essentially empty (just an agent ad), so more details should be requested before committing."}
