{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Near National Biotechnology Research Park (國家生技研究園區), Nangang", "notes": "This is a ground-floor commercial/storefront space, NOT a residential apartment. The interior shows a long, empty corridor-like space with deteriorating floors (tiles peeling off), bare concrete walls with water damage and peeling paint, metal roller shutters on the sides, and a basic utility sink area with old shelving — resembling a former shop or market stall. Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby: no residential facilities, poor condition, potential mold/damp issues, and exposed wiring. The exterior photos show nearby landmarks (National Biotechnology Research Park and a modern high-rise) but the unit itself is in very poor, unfinished condition."}
