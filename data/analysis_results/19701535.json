{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment in Zhongshan with clean white tile floors, central AC, and contemporary furnishings including red leather sofas and a dining set. The living area is large and open with good natural light from large windows; the bedroom is simply furnished with a bed and nightstand. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp glass corners that would need padding, and the windows appear to have sliding panels without visible child locks — being on the 11th floor, window safety should be verified. No balcony is visible in the photos, which is a plus for child safety. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), so details about layout and amenities are unclear."}
