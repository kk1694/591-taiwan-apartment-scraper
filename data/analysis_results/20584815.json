{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with sleek finishes. Features include wall-mounted AC units, built-in storage, modern kitchen with integrated appliances, and hardwood flooring in bedrooms. The space is clean with minimal sharp corners and no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access, making it relatively baby-safe. Good natural light through large windows with full curtains. Being on 10F of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
