{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly furnished apartment with stylish decor including designer pendant lights, L-shaped sectional sofa, 6-seat dining table, and sleek tile flooring throughout. The living area is spacious and clean with wall-mounted AC units; the bedroom shown is small with a single/small double bed on a low platform, which is good for baby safety. For baby concerns: the hard tile floors throughout would need rugs, the glass coffee table edges could be hazardous, and no balcony is visible in these photos which is a plus for safety. At 39 ping on the 2nd floor of a 14-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator, and the generous size offers room for a nursery setup."}
