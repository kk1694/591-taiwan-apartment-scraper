{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern minimalist design, light wood laminate flooring throughout, modern LED light fixtures, wall-mounted AC units, and ample built-in storage/wardrobes. The space is very clean and spacious at 36.57 ping with multiple rooms including a large master bedroom with en-suite bathroom. Being on the 2F of a 4-story walkup building means no elevator, which is a concern for carrying a stroller and baby gear; the flat layout inside is baby-friendly with smooth floors and no visible stairs, though the wall-mounted wine rack decorations and some exposed cables near the TV should be addressed for baby-proofing."}
