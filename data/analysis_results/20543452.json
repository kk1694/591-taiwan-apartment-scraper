{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment with contemporary minimalist design, marble dining table, sleek built-in cabinetry, and updated appliances including AC and modern kitchen. Excellent condition and cleanliness. For baby safety, the low TV stand with sharp marble edges may need corner guards, and the open floor plan is good but the narrow kitchen could pose crawling hazards. Good natural light from large windows with blinds. Being on 6F of a 14F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
