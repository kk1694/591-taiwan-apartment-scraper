{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including marble-look tile flooring, recessed LED lighting, frosted glass sliding doors, large flat-screen TV, and stylish minimalist furniture. The bedroom has wood-look flooring and an en-suite bathroom with glass shower enclosure. For baby safety, the marble tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling/walking toddler, the coffee table has some sharp edges, and the glass sliding doors between living room and bedroom could be a hazard; no balcony or stairs are visible which is positive. The apartment is very clean and move-in ready but the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), and at 3F with no elevator info it may be a walk-up building."}
