{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern, stylishly renovated apartment with open-plan living area, kitchen island with bar stools, built-in shelving, and light wood flooring throughout. The space is spacious at 37 ping with large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light and lush greenery views. For baby safety, the kitchen island has sharp corners and the bar stools could be a tipping hazard; the floor-to-ceiling windows on the 2nd floor should be checked for secure locks. The open layout with no visible stairs is a plus, and the overall condition is excellent and very clean. Being on 2F of a 13-floor building strongly suggests elevator access. Note: the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on bedrooms and bathroom count."}
