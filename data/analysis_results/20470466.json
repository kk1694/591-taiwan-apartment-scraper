{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Brand new luxury high-rise apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes throughout. The unit features a stylish living room with contemporary furniture, a fully equipped galley kitchen with built-in appliances (oven, microwave, large refrigerator), and a sleek bathroom with glass-enclosed shower and modern toilet. For baby safety, the glass shower partition and narrow kitchen corridor with many drawer pulls at low height are minor concerns, but overall the flat layout with no stairs is good; the building entrance has a grand secure lobby. The 26-floor building clearly has elevators, and the 3rd floor unit in this new development should get decent natural light, though interior photos suggest a somewhat narrow layout."}
