{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern open-plan apartment with stylish kitchen island, contemporary dark cabinetry, and light wood flooring. The space appears clean and well-maintained with good natural light. For baby safety, the open shelving above the kitchen island and lack of visible railings on upper storage could pose climbing hazards as baby grows; the kitchen layout is fairly open which is good for supervision."}
