{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with wood-grain flooring, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, modern kitchen with stainless steel sink, and a clean bathroom with glass shower partition and Japanese-style smart toilet. Good natural light from large windows with greenery views; the balcony has metal railings visible from the living room which would need baby-proofing, and the kitchen has a narrow door leading to a rear service balcony area. At 37 ping this is spacious for a growing family, though being on the 4th floor of a 5-story walkup (likely no elevator) could be challenging with a stroller and baby."}
