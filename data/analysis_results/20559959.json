{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern duplex-style apartment with white minimalist decor, crystal chandeliers, and high-end finishes. Major baby safety concern: the interior spiral staircase has wide gaps between railings that a child could easily fall through or get stuck in. Good natural light from kitchen windows with decorative ironwork. The top floor location (13F/13F) and spiral stairs indicate this is likely a rooftop addition."}
