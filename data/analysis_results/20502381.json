{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment (35 ping) with polished hardwood floors, modern LED ceiling lights with cove lighting, and clean white walls in excellent condition. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) on floor 10 of 12, strongly suggesting elevator access. The unit appears very baby-friendly with no visible stairs, open floor plan with rounded ceiling details rather than sharp corners, and windows positioned at adult height; however, the unit is completely empty so kitchen/bathroom conditions are unknown, and the limited number of photos (only showing living areas) is a minor red flag — request a full viewing to check all rooms, balcony safety, and appliance situation."}
