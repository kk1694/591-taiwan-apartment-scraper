{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Excellent modern renovation with pristine white tile floors, recessed lighting, modern AC units, stylish wood-accent TV wall, and a fully updated kitchen with gas stove, range hood, and ample cabinetry. The unit is very spacious (64.5 ping) and completely unfurnished, which is great for a family to set up safely. Baby safety considerations: the polished tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for crawling/toddling, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows with dark frames appear to have no visible balcony railings in photos — verify balcony safety; no stairs visible so single-level living is ideal. Being on the 3rd floor of an 11-story building strongly suggests elevator access, and the listing is managed by UR HOUSE, an agency specializing in expat/foreign rentals, which is a plus for a foreign couple."}
