{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment (56 ping) with ornate ceiling moldings, marble-look tile floors in the living room, and wood floors in bedrooms. The decor is dated (90s-2000s era) with heavy wood built-in cabinetry throughout, wall-mounted split AC units, and classical styling, but the unit appears clean and well-maintained. For baby safety, the black glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the living room windows appear low enough to require guards; the bedrooms have adequate natural light with large windows, and the third bedroom could serve as a nursery. Listed via UR HOUSE (a foreign-friendly rental agency), which is a positive sign for an expat couple."}
