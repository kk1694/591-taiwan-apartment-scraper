{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including recessed LED lighting, light wood-tone laminate flooring, sliding glass kitchen partition, new kitchen with granite countertops and gas stove, and a modern bathroom with glass shower enclosure and wall-hung vanity. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and the glass kitchen partition doors are potential baby safety concerns that would need childproofing. The living/dining area is spacious and open with decent natural light from multiple windows, though some windows appear to face adjacent buildings closely; overall very clean and move-in ready."}
