{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with marble accent walls, recessed lighting, and polished tile flooring throughout. The spacious living area has large windows with good natural light, and the kitchen features a built-in oven, gas cooktop, and range hood. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors with a low threshold that would need child locks; the slippery polished floors may require rugs. Overall very clean condition with no visible red flags."}
