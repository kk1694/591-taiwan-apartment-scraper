{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with multiple bedrooms, recessed lighting, laminate flooring, and contemporary built-in cabinetry. The unit appears clean with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners and the balcony sliding door visible in the living room would need attention; the glass-paneled doors throughout also present potential hazards. High floor (13F/18F) strongly suggests elevator access."}
