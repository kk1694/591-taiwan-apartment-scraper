{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "This is clearly a commercial office space, NOT a residential apartment. All images show a large open-plan room with drop ceiling tiles, fluorescent panel lighting, commercial-grade central AC vents, and black baseboards typical of Taiwanese office buildings. The space is completely empty with no kitchen, bathroom, or residential fixtures visible. Major red flag: entirely unsuitable for a family with a baby as it would require full residential conversion including plumbing for kitchen/bathroom. The listing description also references a real estate sales package (售屋套餐), suggesting this is a broker-listed commercial property."}
