{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment in excellent condition with high-end finishes throughout — recessed lighting, central AC in living room, split AC in bedroom, built-in kitchen with oven, island counter, and large windows facing greenery. At least 2 bedrooms (one master, one smaller room suitable as nursery/office) plus a spacious bathroom with separate shower enclosure and soaking tub. For baby safety: the low coffee table has some sharp corners, the bathtub area would need supervision, and the bed is elevated on legs which a crawling baby could get under. Windows appear to have secure black frames with no accessible balcony visible, which is positive. Good natural light and very clean; the listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder) which is a minor red flag — verify actual terms and layout directly with the agent. Being on 4F/5F with no elevator info means stroller access could be difficult."}
