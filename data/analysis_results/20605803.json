{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a well-maintained luxury apartment with European-style decor featuring ornate crown moldings, crystal chandeliers, and marble floors. The unit appears clean but has dated styling from the 2000s era. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with metal frame and decorative iron gate near the entrance could pose concerns; no visible stairs but the open kitchen layout would need baby-proofing. Good natural light from large windows in living room."}
