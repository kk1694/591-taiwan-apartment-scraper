{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with stylish track lighting, modern LED fixtures, and clean white/neutral tones throughout. The living room is spacious with a large L-shaped sofa, the kitchen features a sleek white design with pink glass backsplash and gas cooktop, and the bathroom has marble-look tiles with glass-enclosed shower. For baby safety, the 1F location eliminates balcony fall risk but the second bedroom appears quite small; the glass shower enclosure and exposed sink plumbing in the bathroom would need childproofing. Listed through UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a foreigner-friendly rental agency, which is a positive sign for an expat couple."}
