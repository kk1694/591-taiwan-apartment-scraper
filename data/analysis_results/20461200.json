{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with contemporary finishes including recessed LED lighting, sleek kitchen island with bar stools, hardwood flooring, and minimalist design. Good natural light from large windows with greenery views. For baby safety, note the glass display cabinet with sharp edges, elevated metal bar stools, and open floor plan with hard corners on the kitchen island that would need childproofing. Clean and well-maintained condition overall."}
