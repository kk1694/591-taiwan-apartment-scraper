{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "The listing description is essentially empty, containing only a generic agent advertisement about purchasing a sales package. At 49 ping (161.7 sqm) for NT$99,999/month in Zhongshan, the price seems reasonable for the size. The building is only 4 floors (unit on 3F) which strongly suggests no elevator, a concern for a couple with a baby and stroller. Without images or a real description, it is impossible to assess modernity, baby safety features, or whether this is actually a residential flat versus commercial space."}
