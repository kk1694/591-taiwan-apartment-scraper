{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "High-end luxury apartment with herringbone dark wood flooring, marble TV feature wall, recessed and accent lighting, sleek white built-in kitchen with integrated appliances, and designer en-suite bathroom with bathtub. The 11-story building on floor 3 almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the windows appear to have security grilles which is positive, but the dark flooring may show wear and the overall moody/dark aesthetic means limited natural light in some rooms; the balcony area has floor-to-ceiling windows with curtains. Very clean and well-maintained with upscale finishes throughout."}
