{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes throughout — light wood laminate flooring, sleek L-shaped kitchen with induction cooktop, built-in oven, and ample cabinetry (still has protective film on cabinets), plus a modern bathroom with bathtub, smart toilet, and stylish vanity. Multiple bedrooms with good natural light and horizontal louvered window guards provide decent baby safety; the 9th floor of an 11-story building almost certainly has an elevator. Listed via UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly rental agency), the unit is unfurnished which allows customization but requires purchasing furniture; the bathtub will need supervision with a baby, and window guards appear secure but should be verified in person."}
