{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with clean finishes, recessed LED lighting, central AC, and contemporary furniture. The unit has a separate bedroom, a small second room (could serve as a nursery), a living/kitchen area, and a modern bathroom with glass shower partition. For baby safety: the glass partition between kitchen and living area has sharp edges, the bathroom has slippery dark marble flooring, and the second bedroom is quite narrow. Natural light appears limited as blinds are closed in all photos and no balcony is visible, which is a minor concern. Overall clean and move-in ready but compact for a growing family at 20 ping."}
