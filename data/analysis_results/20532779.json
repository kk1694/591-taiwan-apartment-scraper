{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment with dated but well-maintained wood-panel finishings from the 1990s-2000s era, marble-look tile floors, recessed lighting, and built-in cabinetry throughout. The living room has good natural light from a large window with security grilles, leather recliner sofas, and AC units. The dining area features a glass display cabinet and a separate enclosed kitchen visible in the back. For baby safety, the marble floors are very slippery and hard, the glass display cabinets in the dining room have sharp edges and breakable panels, and the window security grilles appear sturdy which is a plus on 3F. No elevator is visible and the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a red flag for transparency."}
