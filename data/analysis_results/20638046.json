{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "KT STAR (基泰之星), Zhongshan District", "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment in the KT STAR (基泰之星) building with clean tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, AC, washing machine, and a compact kitchenette with glass backsplash. The 14-floor building almost certainly has an elevator; the unit appears to be an open-plan studio layout at 25 ping. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp metal X-frame legs that could be a concern, there is a balcony visible through the large windows that should be checked for railing spacing, and the hard tile flooring would benefit from play mats; overall the space is clean and bright with good natural light from large windows."}
