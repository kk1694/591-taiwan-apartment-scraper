{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with recessed lighting, decorative ceiling moldings, and quality finishes. The spacious open living area has polished tile floors, while bedrooms feature hardwood flooring and built-in shelving. Very clean condition with ample natural light; the raised platform near the TV area could be a minor tripping hazard for a crawling baby, but overall the layout is baby-friendly with no visible stairs or concerning balcony access in these images."}
