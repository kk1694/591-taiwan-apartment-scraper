Clean and well-maintained but features dated window AC units and traditional fixtures from likely 1990s-2000s era. Very large open layout with ample natural light; the marble floors may be slippery for toddlers but no stairs or dangerous balconies visible. Multiple bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms and built-in closets make this suitable for a family."}
