{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with recessed LED lighting, built-in cabinetry, clean white tile flooring, and contemporary furniture. The space appears very clean and well-maintained with a bright green accent wall. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with metal frame has sharp edges that would need corner guards, and the open shelving units are low enough for a toddler to climb; however, no dangerous stairs or balcony railings are visible. Natural light appears limited with only small windows visible, but the LED lighting compensates well. Only the living room area is shown across all 5 images — no bedroom, bathroom, or kitchen views are provided, which is a red flag for a 27-ping apartment at NT$61,000/month; the listing description is also essentially empty (just an agent ad), so an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
