{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, modern light wood flooring, and contemporary furniture including a large sectional sofa and massage chair. The open living/dining area has good artificial lighting but windows appear small with limited natural light. For baby safety, the floor plan appears mostly flat and open with no visible stairs, though the exposed wires near the TV area would need cable management."}
