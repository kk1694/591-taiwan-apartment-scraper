{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Brand new or nearly new apartment in excellent condition with modern white minimalist finishes, recessed LED lighting, central AC, marble-look kitchen backsplash, gas cooktop, and stainless steel range hood. The unit is unfurnished with polished tile floors throughout, large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light, and at least two bedrooms. For baby safety, the kitchen has a balcony door with security grilles which is positive, and the tile floors are smooth but very slippery; no stairs are visible. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), the 22-story high-rise on the 9th floor virtually guarantees an elevator. The description is minimal (just an agent ad), so confirm layout details and lease terms directly."}
