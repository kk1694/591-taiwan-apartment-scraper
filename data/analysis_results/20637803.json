{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 36 ping apartment with dated traditional-style furniture (floral sofas, wooden legs) but well-maintained hardwood floors and clean walls. Good natural light from multiple windows, open floor plan with dining and living areas connected. For baby safety: no visible balcony railings in exterior shots, marble coffee table has sharp corners, furniture legs could be trip hazards; the floor appears smooth and easy to clean which is a plus."}
