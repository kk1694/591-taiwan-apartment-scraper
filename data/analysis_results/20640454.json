{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in very clean condition with modern finishes including recessed lighting, split AC units, frosted glass partition with black metal frames, and contemporary wood-grain doors. The unit appears to have at least two rooms separated by a stylish glass divider, with floor-to-ceiling windows providing decent natural light. For baby safety, the glass partition could be a concern as it could shatter if impacted, but there are no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access; the flat tile flooring is easy to clean but could be slippery. Note this is completely unfurnished with no kitchen or bathroom shown, and the listing description is just a generic agent advertisement with no real property details, which is a minor red flag."}
