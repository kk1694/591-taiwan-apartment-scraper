{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes, recessed LED lighting, marble-look tiles, and quality furniture. Excellent natural light through large floor-to-ceiling windows with sheer curtains. The open floor plan with smooth tile flooring is baby-friendly, though the glass coffee table edges and low TV console with electronics may need childproofing. Kitchen is modern with built-in appliances but has a galley layout. No visible balcony railings or stairs in photos. Very clean and well-maintained condition."}
