{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older but clean and well-maintained unfurnished apartment on 9F/10F with tile floors throughout. The unit is spacious at 35 ping with a separate kitchen featuring gas stove and range hood, plus two balcony areas with lattice/diamond-pattern railings and security grilles. For baby safety, the balcony lattice railings have openings that could be a concern for small fingers, and the tile floors are hard but the flat layout with no stairs is a plus; the rear balcony has metal security grilles which add safety. Natural light appears moderate through balcony-facing windows, and the description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag suggesting limited detail about the property."}
