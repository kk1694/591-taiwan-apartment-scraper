{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with European-style wainscoting, polished marble-like tile floors, modern recessed lighting, and a bright open-plan living/dining area with a white kitchen. The large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light, and the overall condition is immaculate and move-in ready. For baby safety, the hard tile floors are slippery and the low coffee table has sharp corners, but there are no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings; the description is essentially a broker ad with no useful details about the unit itself."}
