{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and clean studio apartment listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) with brand-new fixtures, recessed lighting, marble-look bathroom tiles, glass shower partition, electronic bidet toilet, built-in wardrobes, kitchenette with TECO fridge, and light wood-tone furniture. At 12 ping this is a compact studio — tight for a couple with a baby, as there is no separate bedroom and the bed is in the main living area. The space appears baby-safe with no visible balcony access, no stairs, and smooth rounded furniture, though the glass shower partition in the bathroom would need a child lock; the building is a 15-floor modern tower on floor 5 so elevator is virtually certain."}
