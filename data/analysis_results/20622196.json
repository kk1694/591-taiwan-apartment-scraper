{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Older-style spacious apartment (48 ping) with dated decor including dark green marble floors, heavy wooden built-in cabinets, and an aging yellow-toned kitchen with old cabinetry and gas stove. The living room has sharp-cornered glass coffee table and hard leather sofas; the marble floors would be slippery for a crawling baby and the kitchen has accessible low cabinets and items on the floor posing safety concerns. The bedroom is reasonably bright with AC, but overall the unit feels worn and would need significant baby-proofing; at NT$75,000/month it is overpriced for the condition, and no elevator is confirmed for a 3rd floor walkup in what appears to be an older 7-story building."}
