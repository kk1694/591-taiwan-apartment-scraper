{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment with recessed lighting, contemporary furniture, built-in shelving, and open-plan living/dining/kitchen area. Good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety: the balcony visible in images has standard railings that would need supervision; furniture has rounded edges (white ottoman); no visible stairs. Clean condition with quality finishes. Being on 4F of a 15F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
