{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near Taipei 101", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment on 15F of a 19-story high-rise tower with stunning direct views of Taipei 101. Interior is very well-maintained with recessed lighting, polished tile floors, open-plan living/dining/kitchen, modern AC units, and quality leather sofa. The flat open layout with smooth tile floors is generally baby-friendly with no visible stairs, though the glass display shelving above the sofa and sharp coffee table corners would need child-proofing. Natural light is good from multiple windows with mountain and city views. Very clean and move-in ready; a premium Xinyi location."}
