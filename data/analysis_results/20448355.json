{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/industrial space, NOT a residential apartment. Images show a large empty basement-like area with industrial fluorescent lighting, exposed pipes, concrete floors with cracks, and a metal staircase. The exterior shows a carport/garage entrance. While the bathroom is newly renovated, the main space is unsuitable for residential living with a baby due to the industrial nature, metal stairs without railings, poor natural light (basement windows only), and overall warehouse appearance."}
