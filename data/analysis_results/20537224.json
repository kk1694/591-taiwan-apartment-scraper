{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with recessed LED lighting, hardwood floors, open-plan living/dining/kitchen area, and at least two spacious bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and shelving. The unit is very clean with a minimalist aesthetic, good natural light from multiple windows, and split-type AC units. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is ideal; the coffee table has rounded edges but low windows in bedrooms should be checked, and the open kitchen area would need baby-gating. At 52 ping on the 9th floor of an 11-story building (very likely to have an elevator), this is a spacious, family-friendly option in Da'an district, though NT$88,000/month is a premium price. Listed through An-Ho Real Estate."}
