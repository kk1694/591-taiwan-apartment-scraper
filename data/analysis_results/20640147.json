{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with polished tile floors, built-in cabinetry, large L-shaped leather sofa, and a dedicated TV entertainment wall. The living room is very large with good lighting and multiple rooms visible through sliding glass doors. The bedroom has hardwood flooring, built-in wardrobe, AC, and decent natural light. Windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, and the glass-topped coffee table and glass shelves on the TV wall are potential hazards for a crawling baby. The tile floors are very smooth/slippery which could be a concern once the baby starts walking. Overall the apartment is clean, generously sized at 36 ping, and in good condition though the decor style is slightly dated rather than ultra-modern."}
