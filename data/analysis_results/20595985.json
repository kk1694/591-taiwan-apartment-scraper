{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, newly renovated apartment on the top floor (21F) with clean white tile floors, split AC units, and contemporary furnishings. The bedroom is very small with only a single bed, which is a major concern for a couple — the listed 20 ping may include shared or common areas. The unit appears clean with no visible sharp corners or stairs, but the bedroom size and single bed suggest this may be partitioned shared housing (隔間套房) rather than a true 1-bedroom apartment, which is a red flag at NT$46,000/month."}
