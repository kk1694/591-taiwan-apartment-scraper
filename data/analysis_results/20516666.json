{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very well-maintained modern apartment with high-end finishes including crystal chandeliers, recessed ceiling AC, polished marble-look floors, built-in TV wall unit, and a fully equipped modern kitchen with gas stove, Panasonic refrigerator, range hood, and kitchen island. The living area is spacious (36.68 ping) with large windows providing good natural light; balcony railings visible in image 3 appear adequately tall but would need child-proofing. The unit is on 3F of a 15-story building (very likely has elevator), and the smooth hard floors are easy to clean but slippery for a crawling baby — area rugs recommended."}
