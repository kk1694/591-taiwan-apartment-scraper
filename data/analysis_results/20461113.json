{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated finishes — the kitchen area has pink tile walls, stained/discolored walls visible in the bedroom, and an ornate stained-glass ceiling panel in the dining area suggesting 1990s-era construction. The living room is spacious with hardwood floors, a large leather sofa, and sliding glass doors to a balcony which would need baby-proofing. The bedroom shows bare wooden bed frames without mattresses and some wall moisture damage or staining near the door. For a baby, the balcony access, sharp-cornered coffee table, and the older kitchen area are concerns, though the overall space at 36 ping is generous for a family."}
