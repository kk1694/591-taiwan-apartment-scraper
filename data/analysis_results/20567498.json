{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio/1-bedroom with high-end finishes including built-in appliances (oven, wine cooler), recessed lighting, and sleek cabinetry. The space is immaculately clean with minimal sharp corners on furniture. For baby safety, the open-plan layout is good but the low coffee table and bed platform edges may need padding; no visible balcony railings or stairs are a concern. Natural light appears moderate from the frosted glass doors."}
