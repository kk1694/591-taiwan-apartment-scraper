{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with polished tile floors, recessed LED lighting, AC units, wall-mounted TV, washing machine, microwave, and built-in kitchen. The unit appears to have a living room, at least two bedrooms (one with en-suite bathroom and sliding-door closet), and a second room with floor-to-ceiling windows and wardrobe. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery, the coffee table has sharp corners, and the balcony area with floor-to-ceiling windows would need childproofing; no dangerous stairways visible. Being on 3F of a 12-story building strongly suggests elevator access, and the overall condition is very clean and well-maintained with decent natural light from multiple windows."}
