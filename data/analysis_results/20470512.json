{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment with clean finishes including light wood-look flooring, recessed AC units, modern kitchen with bar counter and gas stove, and a smart toilet with bidet in the bathroom. The living area has a video intercom system indicating a newer building. Some ceiling staining/yellowing visible in bedroom area around the AC unit is a minor concern. For baby safety, the bar stools in the kitchen are a tipping hazard, and the bathroom has hard tile floors with sharp vanity corners; the apartment appears to be on 9F/18F so an elevator is very likely present."}
