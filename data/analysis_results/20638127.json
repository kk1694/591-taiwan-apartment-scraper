{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Hangzhou South Road Section 2, Lane 61 (杭州南路二段61巷), near Post Office and Telecom Bureau dormitories", "notes": "This is a spacious 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom apartment with living room, dining room, kitchen, and two balconies. The floor plan shows stairs (樓梯) rather than elevator access, which is a concern for a family with a baby. The building appears to be an older walk-up (6F of 7F). No interior photos were provided to assess condition, modern fixtures, or baby safety features like balcony railings - only exterior, map, and floor plans are shown."}
