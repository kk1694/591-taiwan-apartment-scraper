{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures - the kitchen has staining around the range hood, old-style exhaust fans, and basic gas stove setup. The living area is spacious and clean with tile floors, but furniture and finishes are outdated. For baby safety: no visible stairs or dangerous railings, but the wooden ladder in the kitchen and exposed wiring/pipes could be concerns. Limited natural light with small windows, especially in the kitchen area."}
