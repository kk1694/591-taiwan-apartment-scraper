{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songde Road, Xinyi District (松德路83號)", "notes": "High-end modern apartment in a luxury high-rise building in Xinyi District with upscale amenities including indoor pool, gym, and a hotel-style lobby with concierge desk. The interior features dark hardwood floors, modern TV wall unit, recessed lighting, and large glass windows/doors providing good natural light. Only one interior photo is shown (living area) so full layout assessment is limited; the high bar-stool table and minimal furnishing suggest it may be sparsely furnished. For baby safety, the glass balcony doors and floor-to-ceiling windows would need child locks, and the dark hardwood flooring is a plus for cleanliness. The building is on the 6th floor of a 19-story tower, clearly with elevators, and appears very well-maintained."}
