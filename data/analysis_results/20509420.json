{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very stylish, recently renovated apartment with minimalist Scandinavian-Japanese aesthetic. Features modern digital door lock, wall-mounted AC, large-tile flooring, designer leather sofa, and curated art gallery wall. Good natural light through large sheer-curtained windows. For baby safety: the tile floors are hard (needs rugs/mats), folding metal dining chairs have pinch points, and the small kitchen appears to have an open doorway without a gate — overall the open layout is manageable with standard baby-proofing. At 30.7 ping this is spacious for the price, though only 5 photos were provided and no bedroom or bathroom is shown, which is a minor red flag."}
