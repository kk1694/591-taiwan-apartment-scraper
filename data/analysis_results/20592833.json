{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near Taipei 101 area", "notes": "High-end modern apartment on 11F with luxury finishes including hardwood flooring, recessed LED lighting, sleek built-in cabinetry, modern kitchen with built-in oven and washer/dryer. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows on multiple sides with city skyline views. For baby safety, the balcony has glass and metal railings visible from the living room that would need childproofing; the sharp-cornered glass dining table and coffee table edges are concerns. Overall very clean, well-maintained unit in what appears to be a premium high-rise building in the Xinyi commercial district."}
