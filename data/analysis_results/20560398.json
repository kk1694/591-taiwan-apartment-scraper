{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean white walls, light wood flooring, large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors providing excellent natural light, split AC units, and recessed/track lighting. The unit appears to be a duplex or loft-style with an internal staircase with metal railings visible in image 4, which is a significant baby safety concern — the open stairs and thin metal railings would need gates and childproofing. The spacious open-plan living area at 45.2 ping is generous for a family; the balcony area behind the sliding doors has metal grille railings which are reasonably safe, and overall the space is very clean with minimal sharp corners on the simple wooden furniture."}
