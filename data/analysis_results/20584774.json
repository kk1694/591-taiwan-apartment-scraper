{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment in a high-rise building (14F/19F) with clean white and wood-tone finishes, built-in cabinetry, digital door lock, AC units, and a TV wall. The unit appears to have 2 bedrooms plus a dining/living area with a kitchen bar counter — good layout for a couple with a baby. Balcony access via sliding glass doors is visible from both bedrooms, which will need child-safety locks once the baby is mobile; the high floor also means balcony railings must be verified for adequate height and gap spacing. The apartment is very clean with no visible sharp corners or hazards, and natural light appears decent through the windows and balcony doors."}
