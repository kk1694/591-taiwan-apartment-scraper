{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with clean white tile flooring in living areas and warm hardwood in bedrooms. The living room is large with good natural light from wide windows, and the kitchen is clean with a Hitachi refrigerator and gas stove. At 38 ping this is very generous for a couple with a baby; the flat layout with no visible stairs is baby-safe, though the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing. Being on the 5th floor of a 12-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Listed through a Japanese real estate agency (Okumura), which may be helpful for foreign tenants."}
