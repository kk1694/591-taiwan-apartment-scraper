{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/office space rather than a residential apartment. It features fluorescent grid ceiling lights, drop ceiling tiles, and large open rooms with no visible kitchen or bathroom fixtures — typical of an office layout. The space is completely unfurnished and empty with some wall staining/discoloration visible. The parquet wood flooring and tile flooring are dated. Not suitable for a family with a baby as it would require full residential conversion, and the description mentions it as a real estate agent sales package listing rather than a genuine rental description."}
