{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern high-rise building complex with well-maintained communal garden areas including playground equipment. Interior shown is clean, unfurnished with polished tile floors, AC unit, and natural light from window. Building appears relatively new with glass balconies; at 14 floors it certainly has an elevator. The community garden space is a plus for families, though only one interior room photo makes it hard to assess full layout and baby safety concerns."}
