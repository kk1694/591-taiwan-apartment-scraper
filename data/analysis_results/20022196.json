{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white walls, contemporary furniture, and updated kitchen with built-in appliances including washer and microwave. Good natural light from large windows and balcony sliding doors. For baby safety: the balcony has metal railings that appear secure but the gaps may need childproofing; the coffee table has rounded corners which is good; no visible stairs. Overall very clean and move-in ready condition."}
