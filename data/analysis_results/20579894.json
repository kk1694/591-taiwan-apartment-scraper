{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin, near a tree-lined boulevard/park", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained modern apartment at 88.3 ping with upscale finishes including recessed lighting, crown molding, large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light, a modern white kitchen with glass backsplash, and an elegant dining area. The building appears to be a mid-rise residential complex on a pleasant tree-lined street near a park. For baby safety, the large windows appear to have secure frames without accessible balcony openings, and the flat tile flooring throughout is easy to clean; however, the hard tile floors and sharp-cornered dining table/chairs would need baby-proofing. At NT$100,000/month this is a premium listing with generous space ideal for a growing family, located on the 6th floor of a 9-story building which almost certainly has an elevator."}
