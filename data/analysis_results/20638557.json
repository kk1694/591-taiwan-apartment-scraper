{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with new light wood laminate flooring, fresh white paint, modern track lighting, split AC units, and a clean updated bathroom with marble-look tiles. The space is very spacious at 43 ping with a large open living area and multiple rooms; being on 1F is convenient for a family with a baby (no stairs needed) but the sliding glass doors to what appears to be a balcony/patio area should be secured with child locks. The bathroom has a wet-room style shower with no separation which could be slippery—overall the unit is clean and in good condition with no major red flags, though the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent promotion), so kitchen, full layout, and natural light details are unclear from the limited photos."}
