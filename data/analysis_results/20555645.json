{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern upscale apartment in Da'an with high-quality built-in wood cabinetry, recessed lighting, polished tile and hardwood floors, and a well-designed open kitchen with island counter. The unit appears to be mostly unfurnished with some clutter and exposed TV cables on the bedroom wall, suggesting it needs cleaning before move-in. For baby safety, the hard tile floors in the living area could be slippery, and the open kitchen layout with gas stove would need barriers; windows appear to have low sills with window seats that a toddler could climb, so window locks should be verified. The 16-story building on the 6th floor almost certainly has an elevator, and the generous 40-ping size provides ample space for a growing family."}
