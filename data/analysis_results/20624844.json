{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu", "notes": "Very modern and spacious living area with recessed lighting, stylish TV feature wall with accent lighting, and polished tile flooring. The unit appears recently renovated and is marketed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency). The large open space and slippery polished floors may be a concern for a crawling baby; window grilles are visible which is good for child safety, but only one image is available so balcony railings and kitchen details cannot be assessed."}
