{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment in Da'an with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in wood-panel TV wall, and quality dark wood kitchen cabinetry with glass backsplash. The living area is spacious and clean with a sofa, coffee table, and dining set; the kitchen includes gas stove, range hood, and full-size fridge. The round coffee table has relatively low sharp edges to watch for with a baby, and the hard tile floors would benefit from play mats; no balcony or staircase is visible, which is good for baby safety. Natural light appears limited as windows are small and photos show nighttime conditions, but the 3F/6F walk-up in an older building means no confirmed elevator — worth verifying."}
