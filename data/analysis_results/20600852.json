{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "The building exterior is a well-maintained mid-rise condo complex with landscaped courtyard, fountain, and covered entrance, strongly suggesting elevator access. Interior photos show a dated living room with gaudy blue LED accent lighting, a curved built-in TV wall unit, glass dining table with acrylic chairs, and sparse furnishing — giving it an outdated early-2000s nightclub aesthetic rather than a modern family home. Baby safety concerns include the glass-top dining table with sharp metal edges, hard glossy tile floors throughout, exposed wires near the TV unit, and the balcony with sliding glass doors that would need child-proofing. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a red flag — no details on layout, amenities, or room count for a 60K/month unit."}
