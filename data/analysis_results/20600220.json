{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "The images appear to be mostly marketing/promotional renders and common-area photos of the building rather than actual apartment interior shots. Image 1 shows a stylish lobby entrance with decorative lattice screens and wooden doors, image 2 shows a balcony with sliding glass doors and wood flooring suggesting modern finishes, and image 3 shows an architectural lattice stairwell area. The building looks high-end and modern, but with only 3 photos (mostly of common areas) and a near-empty listing description (just an agent ad), this is a major red flag — likely a placeholder or bait listing. The balcony in image 2 has glass/mesh railing which could be a concern for a crawling baby; the stairwell lattice design may also pose climbing hazards. Insufficient interior photos to properly assess baby safety, layout, or natural light within the unit itself."}
