{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with sleek white marble-look tile floors, recessed LED lighting, wall-mounted TV, modern kitchen with washing machine, microwave, and refrigerator. The unit is on 12F/15F suggesting a newer high-rise with elevator. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling black-framed windows. For baby safety, the tile floors are very hard and slippery, the low coffee table has sharp metal edges, and the balcony area with sliding glass doors needs childproofing; however the overall layout is open and flat with no stairs, which is positive. The description is minimal (just an agent ad), so details about lease terms are unclear — this is a red flag suggesting it may be a bait listing from an agent."}
