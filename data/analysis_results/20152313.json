{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with wood-tone finishes, recessed lighting, and AC. Currently occupied with children's toys visible, suggesting family-friendly environment. Baby safety concerns include open metal shelving units with many small decorative items at low heights, and cluttered spaces that would need childproofing. Natural light appears limited based on images. The 14-story building at floor 3 strongly suggests elevator access."}
