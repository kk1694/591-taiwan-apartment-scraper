{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment complex (14 floors) in clean condition with polished tile floors, AC units, and a well-maintained bathroom with bathtub. The unit is unfurnished with at least two bedrooms, each with natural light from windows. The building has a nice park/garden area outside with greenery. For baby safety, the tile floors are very smooth and slippery which could be a concern for a crawling/walking baby; the bathtub lacks a non-slip surface; however there are no visible balcony access concerns and windows appear secure. The listing description is essentially empty (just an ad for agents), which is a minor red flag — you would need to visit to confirm layout and full amenities. At 35 ping for NT$45,000 this is spacious and reasonably priced for Beitou."}
