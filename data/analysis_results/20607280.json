{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District, near mountains/greenery", "notes": "Clean, modern apartment on 18th floor of a 21-story high-rise with recessed lighting, white walls, and modern kitchen with gas stove and ample cabinetry. The unit is spacious at 46.8 ping with good natural light from multiple windows showing mountain/greenery views. For baby safety: the floors are smooth tile (slippery but easy to clean), furniture has some sharp wooden corners on the dining set and bed frame that would need padding, and the balcony area visible in the living room should be checked for railing safety given the high floor. The listing description is minimal (just a promotional blurb), which is a minor red flag — request more details from the agent. No mattress provided on the bed frame."}
