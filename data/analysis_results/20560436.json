{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with hardwood floors, recessed lighting, leather sofas, built-in TV cabinet, and split AC units. The living area is large with floor-to-ceiling sliding doors leading to a balcony with visible railings that would need baby-proofing; the glass coffee table has sharp corners that are a concern for a crawling baby. The bedroom shown is smaller but clean with good natural light from two windows. At 11F/14F, the building almost certainly has an elevator. Overall good condition but the description is minimal (just an agent ad), so an in-person visit is strongly recommended to check the full layout, kitchen, and bathroom."}
