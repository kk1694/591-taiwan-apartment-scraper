{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated unfurnished apartment with pristine white polished tile floors, dark baseboards, modern sliding windows with curtains, and a digital door lock. The unit is completely empty and extremely clean with excellent natural light from multiple windows in each room. At 59.45 ping on the 2nd floor of a 9-story building (likely has elevator), this is a spacious family-sized unit. Baby safety is favorable — no visible balconies, stairs, or sharp corners; the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but may be slippery, so area rugs would be recommended. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — confirm actual layout, kitchen, and bathroom details before visiting."}
