{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Very well-maintained modern apartment in excellent condition with stylish interior design, recessed LED lighting, wood laminate flooring, white brick accent wall, split AC units in every room, modern kitchen with large refrigerator and dish dryer, and a clean bathroom with glass-enclosed shower and electronic bidet toilet. The apartment appears to be in a newer high-rise building (4F/14F strongly suggests elevator access) with good natural light from large windows overlooking greenery. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the glass dining table has exposed metal legs; the bathroom glass shower partition and the bedroom's floor-to-ceiling windows should be monitored, but overall the flat layout with no stairs and rounded sofa edges is quite baby-friendly. The second room could serve well as a nursery."}
