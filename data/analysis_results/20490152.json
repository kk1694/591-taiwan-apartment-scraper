{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Modern, clean apartment on a high floor (14F/15F) with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC units, and built-in vanity/desk areas in bedrooms. The unit appears spacious at 58 ping with multiple rooms and large windows providing excellent natural light with mountain views. One room has a balcony door with horizontal railing bars that would need a safety lock for baby-proofing; the tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby, and the unit is unfurnished so you'd need to buy everything. No visible stairs, and corners appear rounded or standard — overall a very clean, well-maintained modern unit suitable for a family."}
