{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious and modern apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, split AC units, and a sleek black-and-white design scheme. The open-plan living/dining area is generous at ~48 ping with large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the polished tile floors are very slippery, the coffee table and dining furniture have sharp metal corners, and the floor-to-ceiling windows in the study/bedroom area have low glass panels that would need child-proofing; the kitchen area has a bar counter with a metal stool that could tip. Overall the unit is clean and well-maintained in a newer high-rise building (10F/13F, almost certainly has an elevator), but the description is just a generic agent ad with no real property details, which is a minor red flag."}
