{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with polished hardwood floors throughout, recessed lighting, AC units, and large windows providing good natural light. The living area is very large with a dining section and built-in cabinetry; two bedrooms are shown with solid wood furniture and ample built-in wardrobes. For baby safety, the marble coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the large windows appear to be at a low height which may need childproofing; no stairs visible which is good. Being on 2F of a 6-story building, it likely has no elevator (older walkup), but this is a minor concern at only 2 floors. Listed through Miller House agency; the description is minimal (agent promotion text only), which is a minor red flag for transparency."}
