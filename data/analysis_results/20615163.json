{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with clean tile floors, built-in wood cabinetry, and contemporary lighting fixtures. The unit appears very clean and well-maintained with an open floor plan; the marble coffee table has sharp corners that may need padding for baby safety. Good natural light visible in bedroom, no visible balcony hazards or stairs, and at 4F/14F the building almost certainly has an elevator."}
