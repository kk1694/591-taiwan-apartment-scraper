{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated apartment with modern white kitchen, built-in microwave, and multiple air conditioning units. Very clean and bright with good natural light from windows. For baby safety: unit appears single-level with no stairs, balcony has solid half-wall railing which is good, but sliding glass door to balcony needs childproofing; unit is unfurnished so no sharp corners from furniture currently."}
