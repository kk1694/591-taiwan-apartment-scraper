{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with polished marble-look floors, recessed lighting, and minimalist furnishings. The apartment is clean with good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety: the balcony railings visible outside windows appear to have standard vertical bars, and the hard polished floors may be slippery; the coffee table has rounded edges which is good. Being on floor 7 of 7, elevator access should be confirmed as it's not visible in images."}
