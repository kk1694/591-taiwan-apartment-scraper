{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District (An-Ho Real Estate listing)", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed lighting, new light-grey wood-grain flooring, and extensive built-in wooden cabinetry and shelving throughout. The open-plan layout is very spacious at 34 ping with a modern kitchen, clean bathroom visible, and an intercom system. For baby safety, the space is largely open and flat with no stairs visible, but some open shelving units have sharp corners at toddler height that would need padding; the windows have security grilles which is good for child safety. Natural light appears moderate — windows are present but some face neighboring buildings with iron grilles, and the unit relies heavily on recessed ceiling lights."}
