{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with high ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light, and contemporary furnishings including leather sofa and built-in storage. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with at least 2 bedrooms. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings that a child could potentially squeeze through, and the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need childproofing. The glossy tile floors are slippery which could be a concern for crawling toddlers."}
