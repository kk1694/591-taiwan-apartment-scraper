{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Newly renovated apartment in very clean condition with modern light wood flooring, recessed lighting, new mattresses still in plastic wrap, split AC units (including Hitachi), and built-in sliding-door wardrobes. At least 3 bedrooms visible with balcony access from bedrooms featuring metal railings - balcony railings appear adequate height but the balcony door opens freely which is a concern for a toddler. The living room window has security grilles which is good for baby safety. Natural light is moderate - living room faces what appears to be a light well with limited direct sunlight, while bedrooms have better exposure. One bedroom appears to have a very low/narrow window near floor level behind the bed which could be a minor concern. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), providing no useful details about the property itself, which is a slight red flag."}
