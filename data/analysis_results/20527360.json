{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern wood-look tile flooring, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC units, and large floor-to-ceiling black-framed windows providing excellent natural light. The unit is completely unfurnished and empty across multiple rooms. Being on 7F/7F (top floor), there is a large open terrace/balcony visible from the main room which is a baby safety concern — the balcony railing height and gaps should be checked in person. The top-floor location also raises potential concerns about heat and water leakage. No elevator info available but being 7F with no elevator would be a significant drawback for a couple with a baby and stroller."}
