{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin", "notes": "Clean but dated apartment listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agent). The unit features older-style window AC units, an aging kitchen with basic gas stove and tiled walls, and furniture that is functional but not modern. At 40 ping it is spacious with a separate dining area, bedroom, and kitchen. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners in the living room is a concern, and the dining table has a glass top as well; the tile floors throughout are easy to clean but hard if a toddler falls. Natural light appears limited with small windows in the bedroom; the living room has a balcony door providing some light. No major red flags but the overall condition is dated for the NT$50,000 price point."}
