{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white finishes, elegant moldings, and updated appliances including washing machine and built-in kitchen. The space appears clean with good artificial lighting though natural light seems limited. For baby safety, the glass sliding doors between rooms and the marble coffee table with sharp edges would need childproofing, and the balcony visible from the bedroom should be checked for railing height."}
