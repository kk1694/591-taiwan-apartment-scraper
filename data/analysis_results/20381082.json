{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern renovation with designer finishes including recessed LED lighting, polished concrete floors, wood panel walls, and a striking circular skylight in the dining area. The open-plan living area has large windows with venetian blinds providing good natural light, a modern kitchen with built-in appliances and washing machine, and a stylish dining space. For baby safety, the polished concrete floors are hard and slippery which could be a concern for a crawling/toddling baby, and the glass coffee table has sharp metal edges; the bedroom appears to be a loft-style mezzanine with angled ceiling suggesting a split-level layout which could pose stair hazards. Listed via An-Ho Real Estate (安禾房屋) in Da'an district at 28 ping — well-sized for a couple with a baby but the description is minimal (agent promotional text only), which is a minor red flag."}
