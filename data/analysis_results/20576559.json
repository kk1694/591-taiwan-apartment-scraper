{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Luxurious, high-end modern apartment listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent) with designer finishes including recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished marble/tile floors, hardwood bedroom flooring, and a fully equipped modern white kitchen with gas range and range hood. The living room is very spacious with large windows providing good natural light, and the master bedroom is generously sized with built-in wardrobes. For baby safety, the polished tile floors in the living area are very slippery and the black-and-white marble entryway has sharp contrast edges on hard stone; the bedroom furniture has some sharp corners on the nightstands and bed frame that would need padding. At 65 ping on the 2nd floor of a 13-story building (almost certainly has elevator), this is a premium expat-targeted property at NT$100k/month — very clean and well-maintained but the minimal description (just an agent ad) is a minor red flag suggesting limited landlord engagement."}
