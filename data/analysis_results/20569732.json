{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with terrazzo floors and dated kitchen with basic gas stove setup. The living room has been staged with plants and modern furniture but the underlying structure is clearly an older building. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, the kitchen has exposed gas stove at low height, and there appear to be no safety gates. Natural light is limited based on the small windows visible. Reasonably clean but showing age."}
