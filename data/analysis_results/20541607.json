{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed LED lighting, wall-mounted AC, ceiling fan, sleek TV wall unit, and clean tile floors. The glass coffee table has sharp edges and the raised wooden platform/step near the shuttered closet area could be a tripping hazard for a crawling baby. Good natural light from large sliding glass doors leading to a balcony with proper railings; the building appears to be a newer 10-floor construction in Datong district, very likely with an elevator at 4F."}
