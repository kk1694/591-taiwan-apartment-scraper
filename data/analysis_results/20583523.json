Clean and well-maintained with contemporary furniture, built-in storage, kitchenette with washing machine, and separate bedroom area. For baby safety, the glass sliding doors and coffee table with metal edges may need child-proofing; no visible balcony concerns but the space is compact at 12 ping for a growing family."}
