{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious unfurnished apartment (39 ping) with clean white tile floors and built-in shelving, but the decorative wooden ceiling beams and older-style kitchen cabinets suggest a 1990s-era renovation rather than a modern finish. The kitchen is dated with worn cabinetry and basic fixtures. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery, the large open spaces are good but the sliding glass doors with metal grilles and accessible low shelving would need childproofing; the building is only 7 floors and on 2F with no elevator info available, so stairs may be needed. The listing description is essentially empty (just a sales promotion), which is a red flag — it provides no real information about the property."}
