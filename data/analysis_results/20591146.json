{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu, near Keelung River with Taipei 101 view", "notes": "High-floor unit (15F/20F) with a river view and Taipei 101 visible in the distance, suggesting good natural light and a pleasant outlook. The window appears to have modern dark-framed glass with screens. Only one image available showing the view from inside, so interior condition, layout, and baby safety features cannot be fully assessed. The listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — more photos and details would be needed to evaluate flooring, kitchen, and child-safety concerns like balcony railings or sharp corners."}
