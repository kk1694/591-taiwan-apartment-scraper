{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with recessed lighting, built-in closets, and wood laminate flooring throughout. The apartment is clean and spacious with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, note the raised tatami platform in one room (minor fall hazard) and balcony visible in image 5 with decorative railings that a toddler could potentially climb; being on 7F/7F (top floor), elevator status is uncertain but common in newer Taiwan buildings."}
