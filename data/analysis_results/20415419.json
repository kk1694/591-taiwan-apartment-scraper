{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean studio-style apartment on 12F with recessed lighting, polished tile floors, built-in kitchenette with washing machine, and large windows providing good natural light. The glass coffee table has sharp corners and the slippery polished tile floor could be concerns for a baby; the large windows appear to have secure frames but the balcony area visible in image 4 should be checked for railing gaps. The description is essentially empty (just an agent advertisement), which is a minor red flag — at ~29.5 ping this appears to be a furnished open-plan suite rather than a multi-room apartment, which may feel tight for a growing family."}
