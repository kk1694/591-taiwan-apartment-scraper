{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "This is a 46 ping (151.8 sqm) apartment on the 4th floor of a 4-floor building, which almost certainly means no elevator - a significant concern for a couple with a baby and stroller. The listing description is extremely sparse (appears to be a promotional/template text rather than an actual property description), which is a red flag suggesting the listing may be low-effort or placeholder. At NT$41,999/month for 46 ping in Da'an, the price seems reasonable but the lack of layout info, property details, and meaningful description warrants caution and an in-person visit before committing."}
