{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Brand new or nearly new modern apartment on the 11th floor of a 27-story building with excellent natural light and mountain views. The unit appears unfurnished with modern grey wood-look flooring, two bathrooms (one with bathtub, one with glass shower enclosure), and a sleek white kitchen with built-in appliances including gas stove and oven. For baby safety, the glass shower doors and bathtub edges are concerns; the large bedroom window on a high floor should be checked for child locks. Overall very clean, move-in ready condition with no visible red flags — a spacious, high-quality unit at 53 ping."}
