{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "This is a 25 ping (82.5 sqm) unit on the 4th floor of a 4-story building, which almost certainly means no elevator — a significant concern for a couple with a baby and stroller. The listing description is essentially empty (just a promotional message for the agent platform), providing no useful details about the unit's condition, layout, or amenities. Without images or a meaningful description, modernity, baby safety features, and natural light cannot be assessed — this listing warrants caution and an in-person visit before consideration."}
