{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with stylish wood-tone finishes, open-plan living/kitchen area, glass-separated bathroom with modern toilet and vanity, and an upscale building lobby/common area suggesting a quality residential complex. For baby safety, the open metal shelving with many small decorative items and plants on high shelves is a concern, and the glass shower partition in the bathroom would need childproofing; the living space appears somewhat narrow but clean. Natural light is limited in the photos shown (mostly artificial lighting), and the listing description is minimal (just a generic agent promotion), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout, bedrooms, and balcony access."}
