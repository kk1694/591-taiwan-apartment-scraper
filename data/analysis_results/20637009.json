{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern, upscale apartment with high-end finishes including polished marble-look tile floors, designer wood-panel cabinetry, recessed and pendant lighting, a stylish open kitchen with built-in oven, breakfast bar, and stainless steel appliances. The living room is spacious with large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light and a balcony with glass doors. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the balcony access should be secured with a child gate; the hard tile floors are slippery but easy to clean. At 60 ping on the 12th floor of a 14-story building, this is a premium unit almost certainly with elevator access, in excellent clean condition with no visible red flags."}
