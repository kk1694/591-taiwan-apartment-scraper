{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a multi-level duplex unit on the top floor (7F/7F) with internal stairs connecting two floors, which is a significant safety concern for a family with a baby - the open stairway has railings with wide gaps. The unit appears dated with older AC units, basic tile flooring, and minimal fixtures. Good natural light from large windows, but the internal stairs and being on the top floor without confirmed elevator access are major considerations for baby safety and daily logistics with a stroller."}
