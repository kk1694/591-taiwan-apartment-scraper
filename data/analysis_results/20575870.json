{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Spacious 52-ping apartment with traditional Chinese-style dark rosewood furniture and decor throughout, including ornate carved wooden columns, calligraphy art, and heavy wooden dining set. The unit is well-maintained and clean but has an older, classical aesthetic rather than modern finishes; the AC units are wall-mounted older models. For baby safety, the glass-top coffee table with sharp metal legs, heavy carved wooden furniture with hard corners, and elevated step between dining and living areas are concerns. Good natural light from large windows/sliding doors, and the generous size at 40K/month in Beitou is reasonable value."}
