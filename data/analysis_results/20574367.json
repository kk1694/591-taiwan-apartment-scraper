{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean studio/1-bedroom apartment with sleek recessed lighting, polished marble-look tile floors, contemporary furniture, kitchenette with washer-dryer, refrigerator, and a separate bedroom area with sliding partition. The space appears baby-friendly with no visible balcony access, no stairs, and minimal sharp corners on the rounded coffee tables; however, the hard tile floors and glass-like coffee table surfaces could pose bump risks for a crawling baby. Natural light comes from large curtained windows, and the overall condition is excellent — though at 24 ping it may feel tight for a couple with a baby, and the listing description is suspiciously minimal (just a generic agent ad), which is a minor red flag."}
