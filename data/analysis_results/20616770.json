{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed LED lighting, new light wood flooring, and freshly painted walls. The unit appears very clean and unfurnished. Being on the 12th floor of a 12-story building, an elevator is likely but not confirmed. The enclosed balcony has good natural light and standard-height railings; the gas water heater is on the balcony which is normal for Taiwan. Baby safety considerations: low window sills on the balcony would need attention, and the open floor plan with minimal sharp corners is generally baby-friendly."}
