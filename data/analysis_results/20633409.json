{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end renovation with recessed LED lighting, marble-style flooring, and contemporary fixtures throughout. The apartment appears extremely clean with quality finishes. For baby safety: the bedroom has floor-to-ceiling glass doors with a small balcony area that would need a gate; the rounded shelving unit has horizontal bars a toddler could climb; low coffee table has smooth edges. Good natural light from multiple windows. Well-designed open layout suitable for a small family."}
