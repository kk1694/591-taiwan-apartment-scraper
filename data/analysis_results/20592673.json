{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older walk-up apartment (3F/4F) with renovated laminate flooring and drop ceiling tiles throughout. Rooms are spacious at 35 ping with multiple bedrooms, clean white walls, AC units, and decent natural light from windows, but the overall style is dated with dark baseboards and older aluminum-frame windows. For baby safety, the large sliding glass doors in the living room leading to what appears to be a balcony need childproofing, and the lack of elevator on the 3rd floor would be inconvenient with a stroller; no visible sharp corners or major hazards but no bathroom or kitchen photos were provided which is a red flag."}
