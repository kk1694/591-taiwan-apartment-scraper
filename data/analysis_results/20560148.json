{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with polished hardwood floors, modern kitchenette with induction cooktop and front-loading washer, and a bright bathroom with glass-enclosed shower. The unit appears to be unfurnished with multiple rooms and good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the hardwood floors are smooth but slippery, the kitchen is compact with accessible appliances that may need child-proofing, and the bathroom glass shower partition has no sharp edges but the glass door could be a concern for a crawling toddler. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat-friendly agency), the 14-floor building almost certainly has an elevator at floor 4."}
