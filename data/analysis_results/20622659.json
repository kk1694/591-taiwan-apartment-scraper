{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, stylishly renovated loft-style apartment with LED accent lighting, leather sofa, built-in kitchen appliances, and clean white tile flooring. Major baby safety concern: the unit has an internal staircase with open-sided steps leading to a mezzanine/loft level with no visible railing or gate, posing a serious fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler. The loft area also has a glass balustrade that may not be child-safe. Natural light appears decent from a balcony window, and the space is clean but compact for a growing family."}
