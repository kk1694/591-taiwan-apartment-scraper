{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and modern apartment managed by UR House (a foreigner-friendly rental agency) with recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, open-plan kitchen with large countertop island, wall-mounted AC units, and a clean contemporary finish throughout. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the open kitchen layout means a crawling baby could access the cooking area easily; a visible emergency exit sign and elevator lobby suggest this is a well-maintained building with elevator access. Natural light appears moderate from the windows visible in the living room, and the overall condition is very clean and well-maintained at 40 ping, offering ample space for a growing family."}
