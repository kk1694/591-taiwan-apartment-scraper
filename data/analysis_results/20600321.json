{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very spacious luxury-style apartment (~59 ping) with ornate wood paneling, chandeliers, marble floors in living areas and dark hardwood in bedrooms — decor is dated/traditional rather than modern. The unit is unfurnished and clean with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the polished marble floors could be very slippery, and there are sharp-cornered built-in wood cabinets at child height; however the flat single-level layout with no visible stairs is a plus. Listed through UR House (foreigner-friendly rental agency) at NT$80K which is reasonable for the size in Da'an, though the older ornate style may not appeal to everyone."}
