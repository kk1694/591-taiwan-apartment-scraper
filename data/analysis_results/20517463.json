{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment managed by UR HOUSE (foreign-friendly rental agency), featuring sleek finishes, recessed LED lighting, open-plan kitchen with washing machine, stylish bathroom with bathtub, and a furnished bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows and balcony access. The glass coffee table with sharp corners and the bathtub are minor baby safety concerns, but overall the unit is clean, bright, and in excellent condition. At 26.9 ping on the 4th floor of a 13-story building (very likely has elevator), this is a solid option for a couple with a baby, though the layout appears to be a 1-bedroom which may feel tight as the child grows."}
