{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale studio/1BR with European-style decor, high ceilings, modern appliances including washing machine and microwave, and very clean tile floors. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and balcony with metal railings visible through bedroom window are potential baby hazards; the space is compact at 43sqm but well-organized. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows in bedroom, though the open kitchen layout may not be ideal for baby-proofing."}
