{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment with open-plan kitchen, recessed ceiling lighting, stainless steel appliances, and contemporary dark wood accents. Good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: the bar stools near the kitchen counter could be a tipping hazard, and the open kitchen layout means the gas stove area would need child-proofing. The space appears clean and well-maintained with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings."}
