{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with polished hardwood floors throughout, recessed lighting, air conditioning, and a large open living/dining area with built-in glass-front cabinetry. The marble coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the low windows in the bedroom may need safety locks or guards for a crawling toddler. Good natural light from large windows in both the living room and bedroom; the unit is clean and in good condition overall, listed via Miller House agency in Da'an district on the 2nd floor of a 6-story building which likely has no elevator."}
