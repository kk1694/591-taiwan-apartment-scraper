{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 49-ping apartment with hardwood floors throughout and a dated but clean interior featuring glass block accent walls and older-style black leather furniture; the unit has good natural light from floor-to-ceiling balcony doors with metal railings that appear adequate for baby safety, though the glass coffee table with sharp corners is a concern. The building is on the 8th of 14 floors suggesting elevator access, and the open layout with no visible stairs is baby-friendly, but the overall finishes (lighting fixtures, shelving, intercom) appear to be from the early 2000s and show some wear on the wood flooring."}
