{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment with high-end built-in cabinetry, marble-style accents, LED cove lighting, large TV, and wood-laminate flooring in excellent condition. The space is a single open room with bed, sofa, dining table, and kitchen area combined — quite compact for a couple with a baby. Baby safety concerns include a glass coffee table with sharp metal corners near the bed, a balcony with floor-to-ceiling sliding doors accessible from the bed area, and numerous cabinet drawers/doors at child-reachable height; the balcony has metal railings but would need childproofing."}
