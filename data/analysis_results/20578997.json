{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Older apartment with recently refinished light-grey laminate flooring but dated fixtures overall. The bathroom is clearly old-style with white tile, green trim, exposed plumbing, and a wet-room layout with no shower separation, which is slippery and a concern for baby safety. The living room has a balcony with sliding doors and the bedrooms have reasonable natural light; walls show some scuff marks and the AC units are older split-type. For a couple with a baby, the lack of a bathtub, the wet bathroom floor, and the dark wooden baseboard trim with sharp edges are minor concerns, but the flat single-level layout is a positive."}
