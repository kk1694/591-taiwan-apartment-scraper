{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Beitou hillside area", "notes": "This is a standalone 2-story villa/house on a hillside with mountain views, not a typical apartment. The interior appears recently renovated with modern finishes, recessed lighting, and clean white walls. Baby safety concerns include outdoor stairs at the entrance, the elevated hillside location with balconies, and the unfurnished space currently under preparation. The property offers excellent natural light and scenic views but the remote hillside location may be inconvenient for a family with a newborn."}
