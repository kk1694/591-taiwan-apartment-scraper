{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "文湖街21巷 (Wenhu Street Lane 21)", "notes": "High-end modern apartment with elegant finishes including chandelier, recessed lighting, wood paneling, and polished tile floors. Excellent natural light with views of Taipei 101 and lush greenery. The balcony has solid brick railings which are safer for a baby than thin metal bars, though the balcony access should be secured. The 8-story building appears to have an elevator based on its modern construction. Very clean condition with no visible red flags."}
