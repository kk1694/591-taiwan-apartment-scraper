{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Well-maintained upscale building with grand marble lobby, concierge desk, and elevators. The unfurnished apartment is very clean with polished white tile floors, ceiling fans, AC units, and built-in wooden wardrobes and shelving. Windows have balcony railings that appear adequately high, and security grilles are present which is good for baby safety; however the hard tile floors throughout would need rugs or mats for a crawling baby. Good natural light from multiple windows in each room. No visible red flags — this is a quality residential complex in Neihu at 9F with a spacious 28 ping layout suitable for a growing family."}
