{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern, professionally designed apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). Features recessed LED ceiling lighting, quality blinds, built-in cabinetry, modern furniture, and a dedicated mahjong/game room with dehumidifier. The glass coffee table and open layout with hard flooring may pose baby safety concerns—sharp glass edges and slippery surfaces would need childproofing. Good natural light from large windows on multiple sides; the unit appears clean, well-maintained, and spacious at ~28 ping, though only living/dining areas are shown with no bedroom or kitchen visible."}
