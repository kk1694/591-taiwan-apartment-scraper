{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Unfurnished apartment in clean but dated condition with older-style ceiling moldings, basic tile flooring, and window-unit AC. The unit is spacious at 29 ping with multiple rooms, windows with security grilles providing decent natural light, and a visible bathroom. For baby safety, the tile floors are smooth and easy to clean, no visible stairs or dangerous balconies, but the completely empty unfurnished state means significant setup cost; the 2nd floor without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller."}
