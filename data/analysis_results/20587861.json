{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-designed apartment with high ceilings, recessed lighting, and quality finishes. Has a loft bed with metal ladder which is a significant safety concern for a family with a baby - the ladder has no gate and could be dangerous for crawling/toddling children. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Kitchen appears clean with washer-dryer combo. Space is relatively compact at 14 ping but well-utilized."}
