{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, upscale apartment with high-end European-style cabinetry, recessed and cove LED lighting, polished tile floors, built-in shelving, central air conditioning, and an open kitchen with breakfast bar. The flat layout with no stairs is good for baby safety, though the slippery polished tile floors and glass sliding doors could be concerns; the balcony visible through floor-to-ceiling dark-framed windows should be checked for railing height. The unit is extremely clean and in excellent condition on the 11th floor of a 19-story building, which very likely has an elevator, with decent natural light from multiple windows."}
