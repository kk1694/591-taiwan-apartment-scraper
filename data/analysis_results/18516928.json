{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern finishes including light wood flooring, white brick accent walls, recessed lighting, and a large leather sectional sofa. The open-plan living/dining area is spacious with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the space has no visible stairs but the brick textured walls could be a minor bump concern; furniture corners on the dining table would need padding."}
