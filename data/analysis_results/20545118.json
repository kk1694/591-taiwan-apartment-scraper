{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment in a newer high-rise building (15F/26F) with recessed LED ceiling lighting, stylish leather sofa, marble coffee table, and a sleek white kitchen with modern range hood and induction cooktop. The apartment appears clean and well-maintained with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, there is a balcony accessible via sliding glass doors that would need a child lock; the marble coffee table has sharp edges that may need corner guards; the tile floors are smooth and easy to clean but could be slippery. Listed through UR HOUSE, a foreigner-friendly rental agency with Japanese/English services, which is a positive sign for a foreign couple."}
