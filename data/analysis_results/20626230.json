{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end loft-style apartment with double-height ceilings, designer furniture, marble TV console, open kitchen with sleek cabinetry, and contemporary lighting fixtures. The unit appears to be in excellent condition with premium finishes throughout. For baby safety, the loft/mezzanine level visible above the living area has glass and metal railings which could be a concern; the open shelving unit has many small cubbies with items at reachable heights that would need baby-proofing. Natural light appears good from floor-to-ceiling windows with sheer curtains. Listed via Sung-Hsin Real Estate agent; the description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — verify actual layout and room count in person as 24.59 ping with loft design may feel smaller than expected."}
