{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is clearly a commercial office space, not a residential apartment. The images show office desks with ergonomic chairs, glass partition walls, large cubby-hole shelving units, and a projector mounted on the ceiling — entirely unsuitable for living. The back room appears to be a bare secondary space with worn walls and minimal fittings. For a couple expecting a baby, this property is completely inappropriate: there is no kitchen, no bedroom, no bathroom visible, and the space is configured for business use with no residential amenities. The description is also just a generic agent advertisement with no real property details, which is a red flag."}
