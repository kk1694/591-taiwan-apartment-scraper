{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or near-new modern apartment in a well-maintained 9-story building with elevator, featuring clean minimalist finishes, digital door lock, recessed lighting, and a modern bathroom with glass-enclosed shower. The unit appears unfurnished with good natural light from large black-framed windows; for baby safety, the tile floors in some rooms may be slippery, and the glass shower door should be monitored, but there are no visible balconies, dangerous railings, or sharp corners—overall a very clean, safe, and appealing space for a young family."}
