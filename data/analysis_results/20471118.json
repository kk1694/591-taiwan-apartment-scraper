{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment in clean condition with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, and updated kitchen with glass backsplash and gas stove. Good natural light from large balcony sliding doors. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the balcony access should be secured with a child gate. Overall a quality residential unit suitable for a family."}
