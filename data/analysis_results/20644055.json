{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxuriously decorated apartment with European-style finishes including ornate crown molding, padded headboard wall, marble-top coffee table, and glass sliding doors between rooms. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with modern appliances (front-load washer, wall-mounted TV, built-in kitchen cabinetry). For baby safety, the extensive use of glass partition doors and mirrored surfaces is a concern as they could shatter; the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from play mats, and low glass coffee table edges pose a bump hazard. Natural light appears limited with heavy gold curtains covering windows, though the bedroom has a window with sheer curtains behind. At 7F/14F the building very likely has an elevator."}
