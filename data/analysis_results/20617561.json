{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated furniture (rattan sofa, basic wood shelving) but clean condition with polished tile floors and white walls. Bedrooms appear spacious with AC units and decent natural light. Windows have security grilles which is common in Taiwan but the balcony/outdoor area visible in image 4 may need child-proofing; no sharp corners visible but furniture is minimal so baby safety concerns are low."}
