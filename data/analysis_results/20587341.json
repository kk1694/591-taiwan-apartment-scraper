{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean white/wood finishes, recessed lighting, split AC, induction cooktop, and glass backsplash kitchen. The bedroom has floor-to-ceiling windows with a balcony that has metal railings — a baby safety concern as the gap spacing should be checked. The unit is on the 10th floor of a 15-story building (almost certainly has elevator). Good natural light from large windows, though the view faces neighboring older buildings. The kitchen is compact with only a single-burner induction hob, which may be limiting for a family but is safer for a baby than gas. Overall very clean and move-in ready, though at 12 ping it is quite small for a couple with a baby."}
