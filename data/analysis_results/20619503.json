{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "This listing appears to be a real estate agent advertisement rather than a detailed property listing, as the description only contains a promotional message about agent packages. At 29.83 ping (98.4 sqm) and NT$73,000/month in Xinyi District on the 2nd floor of a 10-story building, the size is suitable for a family with a baby. Without images or a detailed description, it is impossible to assess modernity, baby safety features, natural light, or building amenities like an elevator."}
