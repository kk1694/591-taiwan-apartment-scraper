{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older Taiwanese apartment with traditional wooden furniture and dated fixtures. The building exterior shows an elevator shaft, and the enclosed balcony has high railings with mesh which is reasonably baby-safe. The glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners that would need childproofing, but overall the space is clean and spacious with good natural light from the large balcony windows."}
