{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with modern recessed LED lighting, new grey wood-grain laminate flooring, and a fully updated kitchen with gas stove, glass backsplash, and ample cabinetry. The open-plan living area is spacious at ~96 sqm with clean lines and built-in storage; for baby safety the open shelving units have some sharp corners that would need padding, but the flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus. Natural light appears limited based on the photos (small windows visible), and the unit is completely empty so all furniture would need to be provided; the listing description is essentially just an agent advertisement with no real property details, which is a minor red flag."}
