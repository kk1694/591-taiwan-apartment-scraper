{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious newly renovated apartment with modern gray wood-look flooring, fresh white walls, split AC units, and modern LED ceiling lights. The space is completely unfurnished with an open floor plan. Good for baby safety as there are no visible stairs, sharp corners, or dangerous balconies - the windows appear to have secure black frames. Limited natural light with small windows, but the space is very clean and move-in ready."}
