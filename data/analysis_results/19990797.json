{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older Taiwanese apartment with dated fixtures, dark wood furniture, marble-pattern tile flooring, and an aging kitchen with old cabinets and gas stove. The rooms are cluttered with storage boxes and the overall decor is from the 1990s-2000s era. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners in the living room is a concern, and the bedrooms have sloped ceiling areas that reduce usable space; natural light appears decent from the living room windows but limited in the interior rooms. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag suggesting minimal landlord engagement."}
