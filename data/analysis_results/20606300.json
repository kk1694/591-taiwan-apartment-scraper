{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained but dated apartment with older-style fixtures and furniture from roughly 2000s era. The balcony has decorative iron railings with wide gaps that pose a safety concern for a baby/toddler - would need childproofing. Good natural light from multiple windows with security grilles, spacious layout at 46 ping, clean condition throughout. Kitchen is functional but older style. Glass-top dining table and sharp-cornered coffee table would need attention for baby safety."}
