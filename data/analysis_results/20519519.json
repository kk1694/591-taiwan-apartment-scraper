{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment in Da'an with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in dark wood cabinetry, and split AC units. The living room is large with floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light and a visible balcony area. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery and the dark wood trim has sharp corner edges at baseboard level; the balcony access through sliding glass doors would need childproofing. At 45 ping on the 2nd floor of a 6-story building, it is unlikely to have an elevator. The listing through a Japanese real estate agency (Okumura) suggests it may cater to Japanese/foreign tenants. The description is minimal (just an ad for the agent platform), so details on lease terms and amenities are unclear."}
