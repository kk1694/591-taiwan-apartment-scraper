{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated apartment with modern minimalist design, open-plan kitchen with island, induction cooktop, and clean white finishes. Very baby-friendly with no visible stairs, smooth corners, and secure balcony doors with floor-to-ceiling glass. The unit appears extremely clean but some rooms have frosted windows limiting natural light; being on floor 11 of 13 strongly suggests elevator access."}
