{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older building with recently refreshed floors and paint but dated kitchen with old tile work, basic gas stove, and narrow galley layout. The rooms are spacious and unfurnished with decent natural light from multiple windows; security grilles on windows are good for baby safety but the kitchen back area appears to open onto a rear balcony that would need childproofing. At 38.9 ping on floor 6 of 7 with no elevator evidence, climbing stairs daily with a baby and stroller could be a significant concern. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent advertisement), which is a minor red flag."}
