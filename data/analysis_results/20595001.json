{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, upscale apartment with elegant finishes including marble-look flooring, crystal chandelier, recessed lighting, and high-end furniture. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has rounded edges but could still be a concern; no visible balcony railings or stairs in photos. The space is clean and well-maintained, suitable for a family though the slippery-looking marble floors may need rugs for a crawling baby."}
