{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near Taipei 101/World Trade Center area", "notes": "High-end modern apartment with warm wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, floor-to-ceiling windows, and designer furnishings managed by UR HOUSE (foreign tenant rental service). The balcony has glass railings which are a significant baby safety concern—the horizontal rail gaps could allow a toddler to climb; the loft-style bedroom with low ceiling and elevated platform bed may also pose fall risks. Excellent natural light from large windows on the 11th floor with views toward Taipei 101 and the Xinyi commercial district, and the unit appears very clean and well-maintained."}
