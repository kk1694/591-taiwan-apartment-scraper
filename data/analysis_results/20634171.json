{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Excellent newly renovated apartment in pristine condition with modern recessed lighting, split AC units, polished white tile floors in living areas, wood-look flooring in bedroom, and a high-end bathroom with soaking tub, glass-partitioned shower, and smart toilet. The unit is unfurnished at 29 ping on the 10th floor with good natural light and city views; the enclosed balcony has high brick walls which are safe for a baby, though the glass bathroom partition and bathtub would need childproofing. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly agency), this is a very clean, move-in ready space with no visible red flags, though the lack of furniture means significant setup cost."}
