{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-furnished modern apartment in a high-rise building (4F/13F, very likely has elevator) with upscale decor including chandelier, decorative wallpaper, built-in cabinetry, and recessed lighting. The living room is spacious with a large sofa, TV unit, and an area rug; bedroom has a double bed with padded headboard wall. For baby safety, the tile flooring is hard and slippery, there are low electrical outlets visible near floor level, and the windows appear to have security grilles which is positive. Natural light appears moderate with windows in both living room and bedroom, though views face neighboring buildings. The description is minimal (agent listing from Dingli Rental Service) with no detailed property info, which is a minor red flag — would need to confirm layout, kitchen, and bathroom details in person."}
