The unit appears very clean with a well-equipped kitchen featuring built-in appliances and an induction cooktop. For baby safety, the glass coffee table on wheels and glass partition doors may need childproofing, but no dangerous balcony railings or stairs are visible. Managed by UR HOUSE, a professional rental service targeting foreign tenants."}
