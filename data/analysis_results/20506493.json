{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency with Japanese-language services). The unit features hardwood flooring, a modern kitchen with induction cooktop, glass backsplash, and stainless sink, plus split AC and built-in storage. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is good, but the low windows in the living area and sharp-cornered dining furniture would need childproofing. Natural light appears limited as the 2F unit faces what looks like an adjacent building close by; only small windows visible. At 23.67 ping this is a decent size for Da'an district, though only the living/kitchen area is shown — bedroom and bathroom images are missing, which is a minor red flag."}
