{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious and clean apartment in a modern 7-story building with elevator (visible from exterior shot). The unit features polished tile floors, recessed lighting with decorative crown molding, split AC units in each room, and at least two large bedrooms with wardrobes. The floors are very slippery polished tile which is a concern for a crawling baby; no balcony hazards visible but windows lack child safety locks. Natural light is moderate from multiple windows though views face neighboring buildings closely. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag - request a full viewing to check kitchen, bathroom, and any unrevealed areas."}
