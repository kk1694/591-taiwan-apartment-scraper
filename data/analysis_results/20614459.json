{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern, renovated duplex-style apartment with high ceilings, marble accent wall, recessed LED lighting, and contemporary furniture. The space appears clean and well-maintained with a galley kitchen visible at the back. Baby safety concerns include the glass balustrade on the loft/mezzanine level which may need additional barriers, and the open staircase access (not visible but implied by the loft). Natural light appears limited with only the kitchen area showing windows."}
