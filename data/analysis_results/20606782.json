{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment in Da'an with dated decor including ornate wallpaper and older-style light fixtures. The unit is clean but shows some floor staining in the bedrooms; tile floors are slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby. The living room has a sliding glass door to a balcony that would need child-proofing. Windows in bedrooms have security grilles which is positive for safety. Natural light appears limited in the bedrooms with small windows, though the living room balcony provides better light. Being on the 2nd floor of a 17-story building strongly suggests elevator access. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — request more details on layout, kitchen, and bathroom condition before committing."}
