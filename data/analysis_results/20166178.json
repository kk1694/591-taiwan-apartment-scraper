{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated wooden built-in furniture and terrazzo floors from likely 1980s-90s. The mattress in the bedroom shows visible stains which is a cleanliness concern. The balcony/utility area has metal security bars but no gate protection at the doorway, and exposed pipes could be hazardous for a crawling baby. Kitchen has functional but older appliances with an exposed gas water heater vent. Good natural light through windows but overall decor and fixtures are quite dated."}
