{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with ornate European-style decor including chandeliers, marble TV wall feature, sculpted ceilings, and light wood laminate flooring throughout. Image 4 clearly shows an elevator entrance inside the unit, confirming elevator access. The large open living area has good natural light from multiple windows with balcony access; however, the balcony railing area and low coffee table with sharp corners could be baby safety concerns. Listed through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency (禾源外商租屋管理公司), which caters to foreign tenants. Very clean and move-in ready, though the description is minimal (just a promotional placeholder), which is a minor red flag — request full details from the agent."}
