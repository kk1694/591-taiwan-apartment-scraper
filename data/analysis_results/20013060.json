{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, and contemporary furnishings throughout. At least two bedrooms visible with large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. The polished tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby, and the glass balcony doors in the bedrooms and living room would need child-proofing; the glass dining table with sharp corners is also a hazard. The 13-floor building on the 4th floor almost certainly has an elevator, and the spacious 42-ping layout is very generous for a family."}
