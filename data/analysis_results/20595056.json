{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu, with view of Taipei 101", "notes": "This is a high-end modern building in Neihu with luxury amenities including a landscaped rooftop garden, covered outdoor lounge, well-equipped fitness center, and an elegant marble lobby. The building appears to be a newer luxury residential complex (branded 'Excellent Again' / 傑創菁英). All images show only common areas and a city skyline view—no interior apartment photos are provided, making it impossible to assess the actual unit's condition, layout, baby safety concerns, or natural light. Being on the 10th of 15 floors strongly suggests elevator access. Red flag: the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), and no unit interior photos are shown, which warrants caution."}
