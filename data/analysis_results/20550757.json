{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with fresh white walls, polished tile floors, split AC units, and modern dark-framed doors. The unit appears recently renovated and mostly unfurnished with at least 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms visible. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard and slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby; no balcony is visible but the bedroom window with curtains should be checked for secure locks on floor 7. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder) which is a minor red flag — request more details on kitchen, laundry, and actual layout before committing."}
