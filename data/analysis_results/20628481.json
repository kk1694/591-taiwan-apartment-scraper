{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated with high-end finishes including marble accents, recessed lighting, modern AC units, and a fully equipped galley kitchen with stainless steel appliances. The apartment is very clean with smooth tile floors that are easy to baby-proof, though the open floor plan would need baby gates at the kitchen entrance and balcony doors. Being on 1F may reduce natural light but provides convenient stroller access without elevator dependency."}
