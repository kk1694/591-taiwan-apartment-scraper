{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, light wood flooring, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture. The apartment appears spacious with an open living/dining area and at least two bedrooms. For baby safety, the space is relatively safe with no visible balconies, stairs, or sharp corners in the main areas; all floors are flat. Natural light appears moderate from windows with blinds. Being on 6F of a 12-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
