{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Daan Forest Park (view of elevated highway and large park)", "notes": "Clean modern apartment with white tile floors, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture. Good natural light from windows with park/city view. The space appears baby-safe with no visible balcony access in main areas, rounded pillar in entryway, and smooth surfaces. The elevated floor (8F) in a 12-story building strongly suggests elevator access. View shows the building is near Daan Forest Park with an elevated highway in front, which may cause some traffic noise."}
