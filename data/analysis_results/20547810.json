{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished marble floors in living area and wood laminate in bedrooms. Clean, bright space with recessed lighting, split AC units, and built-in wardrobes. For baby safety: the living room has a balcony with floor-to-ceiling glass doors that would need childproofing; no visible stairs or sharp corners. Good natural light through windows with adjustable blinds. Being on floor 10 of 15 strongly suggests elevator access."}
