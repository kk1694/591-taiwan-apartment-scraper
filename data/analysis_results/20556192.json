{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylishly renovated apartment with designer lighting, polished tile floors, open-plan living/dining/kitchen area, and large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a balcony — the balcony access and 11th floor height are key baby safety concerns that would need childproofing. The bedrooms are unfurnished with clean white walls and AC units; natural light appears good from multiple windows. The apartment is in excellent, move-in-ready condition with no visible red flags, though the highly polished tile floors could be slippery for a crawling baby."}
