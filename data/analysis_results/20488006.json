{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylish loft-style apartment with unique rustic-modern design featuring exposed wooden beams and decorative tree trunk elements. MAJOR BABY SAFETY CONCERN: The unit has an internal staircase with open metal railings leading to a loft area, which poses significant fall hazards for a crawling baby or toddler. Good natural light through large windows with balcony access, but the open staircase design would require extensive baby-proofing or blocking."}
