{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with fresh renovation — white walls, light tile flooring, new kitchen with glass backsplash, gas stove, range hood, and ample cabinetry. The unit appears to have at least 2 bedrooms, a living/dining area, and a bathroom; at 30.5 ping it is spacious for a family. For baby safety: floors are smooth tile with no stairs visible, corners on furniture are mostly rounded, and the windows have zebra blinds with cords that should be secured out of reach; no balcony is visible in the photos so fall risk appears low. Being on 4F of a 10F building strongly suggests elevator access. A minor concern is the minimal description (agent listing with almost no details), so viewing in person is recommended to verify condition and neighborhood suitability."}
