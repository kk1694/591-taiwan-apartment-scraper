{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with updated fixtures. Images are marked 'AI示意圖' (AI concept images), meaning the actual unit may differ significantly — this is a major red flag. The shown bedrooms have clean tile floors, modern AC, and minimalist furnishings; the bathroom features a bathtub (drowning hazard for baby), modern toilet, and vanity. At 49.57 ping on the 10th floor of a 15-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator. The description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), so no details on layout, balcony, or actual condition are available — an in-person visit is strongly recommended before committing to this listing."}
