{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated luxury apartment with high-end modern finishes throughout — LED cove lighting, sleek light-grey cabinetry, marble-pattern backsplash, built-in appliances, large sectional sofa, and wall-mounted TV. The spacious open-plan living/dining/kitchen layout with smooth wood-look flooring and rounded soft edges is relatively baby-friendly, though the kitchen island corners and low TV stand would need childproofing. Natural light appears limited based on the photos (heavy curtains drawn, no visible balcony), but the generous 31-ping size at NT$60K/month in Datong is good value; managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), which is a positive sign for an expat couple."}
