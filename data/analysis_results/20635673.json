{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older apartment in fair condition with dated finishes - basic tile/laminate flooring, older-style windows with security bars, and a utilitarian tiled service area. The unit is clean and spacious but unfurnished with no modern updates. For baby safety, the windows have security grilles which is good, but the hard tile floors in common areas and lack of any visible balcony railings in images are concerns; the service corridor has a hard tiled floor that could be slippery. Natural light appears moderate with smaller windows."}
