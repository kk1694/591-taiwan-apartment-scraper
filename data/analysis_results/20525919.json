{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very well-maintained modern apartment with recessed LED ceiling lighting, marble accent TV wall, light wood-tone laminate flooring, and a stylish bathroom with dual sinks, glass shower partition, and dark tile finishes. The spacious living room has large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light. For baby safety, the large windows have metal grid frames which is good, but the glass shower partition in the bathroom and sharp marble TV wall corners would need child-proofing; the open floor plan with smooth flooring is otherwise baby-friendly. Listed through Miller House rental agency; at 35 ping on the 3rd floor of an 11-story building, it very likely has an elevator."}
