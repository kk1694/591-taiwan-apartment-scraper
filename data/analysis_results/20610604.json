{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with dark hardwood floors, recessed ceiling lighting, leather sofas, and built-in cabinetry throughout. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the polished hardwood floors could be slippery for a crawling baby. Good natural light from large windows with security grilles; the 12-story building on the 6th floor almost certainly has an elevator, and the overall condition is clean and move-in ready with a generous 43-ping layout suitable for a growing family."}
