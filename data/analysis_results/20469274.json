{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious 45-ping apartment in good condition with ornate ceiling details, marble accent wall, chandelier, light wood flooring, and a well-equipped galley kitchen with gas stove and oven. The flat-floor layout with no visible stairs is good for baby safety, though the sharp corners on the ornate wooden coffee table and the marble TV wall edges would need baby-proofing. Natural light appears moderate with windows and a small balcony visible; the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad) which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and bedroom count before committing at NT$62k/month."}
