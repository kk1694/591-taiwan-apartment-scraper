{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Clean, spacious unfurnished apartment with polished tile floors, multiple bedrooms with windows providing good natural light, and a well-equipped galley kitchen with gas stove, range hood, and dish dryer. The 14-floor building on 2F strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery when wet, windows have security bars which is good, but the unit is completely empty so all furnishing choices are yours; no visible balcony railings or sharp corner concerns from photos, though the kitchen back door appears to lead to a small utility balcony that should be checked."}
