{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean modern studio with white minimalist decor, updated appliances including washing machine, microwave, AC, and refrigerator. The glass coffee table has sharp corners which is a baby safety concern, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows lack visible childproof locks. Good natural light through large windows on the 9th floor; being on a high floor in a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
