{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "This is a duplex apartment (4F-5F) with internal staircase, modern recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and clean white tile/dark wood flooring. The staircase between floors is a significant baby safety concern and would require gating; windows have security grilles which is positive for child safety. Natural light appears limited in some rooms, particularly the bedroom with small windows, though one room has a large curved window bank. The unit is clean and well-maintained with multiple bedrooms, AC units, and ample built-in storage, but the 5-story walkup with no elevator would be challenging with a stroller and baby."}
