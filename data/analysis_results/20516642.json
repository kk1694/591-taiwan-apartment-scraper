{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained older-style apartment with parquet flooring and traditional fixtures. Multiple bedrooms visible with built-in storage, and a spacious dining area. Good natural light through windows, clean condition, but furniture and finishes appear dated (80s-90s style). For baby safety: no visible balcony hazards in photos, but corner furniture has some sharp edges that may need padding."}
