The images show a former restaurant or food service establishment with industrial kitchen hood, exposed pipes on ceiling, storefront glass doors facing the street, and commercial-grade fixtures. The space is in poor condition with dirty/stained floors, peeling paint, and worn walls. Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby - this is not a living space."}
