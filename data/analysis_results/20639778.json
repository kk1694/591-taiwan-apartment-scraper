{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern, and recently renovated unfurnished apartment in Da'an with gleaming polished tile floors, recessed and track lighting, central AC, a decorative stone accent wall, and a separate enclosed kitchen with modern cabinetry. The unit is on the 1st floor of a 13-story building, which means easy stroller access but being ground-level may have less natural light and potential security/moisture concerns; sliding glass doors lead to a small courtyard area. Very clean with no sharp corners or stair hazards visible, and the open layout is baby-friendly, though the polished tile floors are very slippery and would need rugs or mats for a crawling baby."}
