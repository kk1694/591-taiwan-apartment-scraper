{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This apartment appears dated with older-style furniture and fixtures from perhaps 10-15 years ago. The living room is reasonably spacious with matching furniture but limited natural light (heavy curtains, small windows). For a baby, the space seems relatively safe with no obvious hazards visible, though the bedroom is quite compact and the overall decor feels worn. The small window with security bars in the bedroom may limit ventilation and light."}
