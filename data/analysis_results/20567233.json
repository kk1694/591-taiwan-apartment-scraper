{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and stylish apartment with clean minimalist design, LED accent lighting, built-in cabinetry, large flat-screen TV, and quality leather recliner sofa. The space appears well-maintained and bright with light-colored flooring and walls. For baby safety, the bar-height dining area with metal railings and the small round coffee table with hard edges are minor concerns; the apartment appears to be on 2F of a 15-story building so an elevator is likely but not confirmed. Managed by UR HOUSE, a professional rental management company catering to foreigners (Japanese text visible), which is a positive sign for a foreign couple."}
