{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with sleek marble-look tile floors, recessed LED lighting, built-in TV wall unit with accent lighting, and contemporary furnishings. The space is spacious and immaculately clean with large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the polished tile floors could be slippery, and the low half-wall partition between living and bedroom areas would need a baby gate; however, no dangerous balcony access is visible and windows appear to have secure frames. At 12F in a 15-floor building, it almost certainly has an elevator. The description is minimal (agent listing placeholder), so further details on layout and kitchen/bathroom should be confirmed directly."}
