{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment in a 15-floor building with clean tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and a kitchen island with oven and microwave. The balcony has metal railings with reasonable spacing but would need baby-proofing; the sliding glass doors to the balcony and the glossy tile floors are also considerations for a crawling baby. Good natural light from the balcony side, the unit appears clean and move-in ready with greenery views outside."}
