{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including frosted glass partition walls, designer lighting, light wood cabinetry, and a teal sofa. The unit features a loft/mezzanine level with internal stairs which is a significant baby safety concern — the open staircase with glass railings would need baby gates, and the elevated loft area poses a fall risk for a crawling toddler. The space is very clean with good natural light from large black-framed windows and a balcony door, but the split-level layout with steps between areas adds additional tripping hazards for small children."}
