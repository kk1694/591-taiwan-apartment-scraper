{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained traditional Chinese-style apartment with dark hardwood floors and classic furnishings, but dated decor from 2000s era. Good natural light from large windows and balcony access visible in living room. For baby safety: glass coffee table with sharp corners, balcony door access needs childproofing, and glass dining table are concerns. Clean condition overall."}
