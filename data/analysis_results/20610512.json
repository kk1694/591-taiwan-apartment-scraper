{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and clean renovated apartment in Da'an with modern white tile floors, wall-mounted AC units, a well-equipped kitchen with gas stove and large refrigerator, and a dedicated study/storage room with extensive built-in shelving and hardwood floors. The smooth tile floors and flat layout are good for baby safety, though the glass coffee table with sharp corners would need padding; windows have security grilles which help with child safety but the sliding glass doors to the balcony area should be monitored. Natural light is decent from multiple windows, and the overall condition is very clean and well-maintained with quality furnishings."}
