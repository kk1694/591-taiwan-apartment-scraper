{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with recessed lighting, AC units, and quality furnishings including a comfortable sofa and dining set. The space appears clean with smooth tile flooring and no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access, making it relatively baby-safe. Natural light is limited due to frosted/shoji-style windows, and the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding for a crawling baby."}
