The building has an impressive hotel-style lobby with chandelier and lounge area, confirming elevator access. Baby safety considerations: hard tile floors throughout, glass shower enclosure in bathroom, and unfurnished open layout would need childproofing but no obvious hazards like stairs or low balcony railings visible."}
