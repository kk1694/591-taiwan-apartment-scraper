{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with beautiful hardwood floors throughout, modern recessed lighting, and good natural light from large windows. The open floor plan and lack of visible stairs make it relatively baby-friendly, though the marble coffee table with sharp corners would need padding. Clean condition with AC units, ample storage cabinets, and a separate dining area; no visible balcony safety concerns in the photos shown."}
