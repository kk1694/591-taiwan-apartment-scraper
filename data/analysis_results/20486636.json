{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with European-style decor including ornate chandelier, decorative fireplace mantel TV stand, and glossy tile flooring throughout. The kitchen is modern with white cabinetry, built-in range hood, gas stove, and ample counter space. Good natural light from large windows on 8F of a 15-story building (very likely has elevator). For baby safety, the tile floors are very slippery, there are no visible balcony railings to assess, and the ornate furniture has some sharp carved corners that may need padding. Overall very clean and bright, though the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent advertisement), which is a minor red flag."}
