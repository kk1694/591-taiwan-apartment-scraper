{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern white kitchen featuring island counter, glass backsplash, built-in range hood, and gas stove. Spacious 46-ping open layout with light wood flooring, recessed lighting, elegant wall paneling, decorative wallpaper, and a crystal chandelier. Very clean and move-in ready with AC installed. Windows have security grilles which are common in older buildings but the interior is fully updated. For baby safety, the open kitchen island has sharp corners that would need padding, and the low TV cabinet edges should be covered; the flat single-level layout with no visible stairs is a positive. Natural light appears moderate from side windows. No elevator info available for this 7-story building on 2F, but older Shilin buildings often lack elevators."}
