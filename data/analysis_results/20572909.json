{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with light wood flooring, built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, and a stylish open kitchen with dining area. The unit appears to have at least 2 bedrooms (one master with accent wall and vanity, one smaller room suitable as a nursery), and the flat single-level layout with no visible stairs is good for baby safety. Natural light is moderate through zebra blinds on multiple windows; the living room has curtained balcony access which would need childproofing. Listed through UR HOUSE (expat-friendly rental agency), and the 5th floor of an 11-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Condition is clean and move-in ready, though some clutter is visible in photos."}
