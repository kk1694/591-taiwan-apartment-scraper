{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern white cabinetry, stainless steel appliances, and quality finishes throughout. The open-plan living/kitchen area is spacious and clean with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the apartment appears single-level with no visible stairs, furniture has rounded edges, and the bathroom has a glass shower enclosure that would need childproofing. Overall excellent condition with no red flags."}
