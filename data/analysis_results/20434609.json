{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean but dated apartment with older tile flooring throughout and basic fixtures. The kitchen has been updated with modern white cabinetry, glass backsplash, and a gas cooktop, but the rest of the unit feels plain and unfurnished. Bedrooms have nice bay windows providing good natural light and wall-mounted AC units. For baby safety, the balcony has metal security grilles which is good, and the flat tile floors are easy to clean but hard if a baby falls; the bay window ledges could be a climbing hazard for a toddler. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — confirm layout details and whether an elevator exists for the 5th floor."}
