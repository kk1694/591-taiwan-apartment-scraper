{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with sleek minimalist design, recessed LED lighting, and contemporary furniture. The space appears clean and well-maintained with light wood flooring and a muted sage green accent wall. For baby safety, the open floor plan has no visible stairs, and furniture has rounded edges; however, the dining table has sharp marble corners that would need protection. Natural light appears limited in the photos shown (primarily artificial lighting visible)."}
