{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a high-end, luxury modern apartment with designer finishes, floor-to-ceiling windows, hardwood floors, and a minimalist aesthetic resembling a boutique hotel. The images are watermarked '唐宋建設 FOUR SEASONS' suggesting this may be a model unit or developer showcase rather than the actual rental unit. Excellent natural light with lush bamboo greenery visible through large glass walls; the floor-to-ceiling glass panels and open layout are a baby safety concern as the glass partition between bedroom and living area and sharp-cornered modern furniture would need childproofing. The description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — verify actual unit condition in person."}
