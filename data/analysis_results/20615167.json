{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious and bright modern apartment at 60 ping with clean white polished tile floors, modern kitchen with built-in cabinetry and recessed lighting, and large windows providing excellent natural light with mountain views. The glass partition room dividers and sharp-edged glass coffee table are potential baby safety concerns; the unit is mostly unfurnished with open floor plans which is good for child-proofing. Being on the 8th floor of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access, and the overall condition is very clean and well-maintained."}
