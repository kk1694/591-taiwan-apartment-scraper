Features modern white kitchen, large living room with wall-mounted TV, spacious bedroom with walk-in closet and chandelier, and a well-appointed bathroom with both bathtub and separate glass-enclosed shower. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has rounded edges but the open sliding doors between rooms and glass shower partition warrant childproofing; marble-like floors are smooth and easy to clean but may be slippery. Excellent natural light from large curtained windows, very clean and move-in ready condition with high-end finishes throughout."}
