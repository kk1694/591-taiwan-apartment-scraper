{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, split-system AC units, and clean tile flooring. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that pose a risk for a crawling baby, and the traditional wooden furniture has hard edges. Natural light appears adequate from multiple windows, though the unit is partially facing other buildings. Overall clean condition with no visible red flags."}
