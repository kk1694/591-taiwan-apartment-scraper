{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, recently renovated apartment with recessed lighting, split AC, contemporary wood panel walls, and a separate study nook. Very clean with polished tile floors and minimal furniture with rounded edges on the coffee table, which is good for baby safety. Natural light appears limited from the small windows visible, but the interior is bright with ample artificial lighting. No balcony or stairs visible in the photos, reducing fall risks. At floor 7/14, elevator is highly likely."}
