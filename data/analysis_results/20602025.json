{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Luxuriously renovated apartment with high-end finishes including wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, marble dining table, glass-enclosed shower, and an elegant European-style entryway with marble console. The spacious open-plan living/dining area is very clean and well-maintained. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but the glass shower enclosure and decorative items on low surfaces (figurines, ornate furniture with sharp metal corners) would need childproofing; windows appear to have adequate railings. Natural light enters through large windows in the living area, and at 34 ping on the 9th floor of a 12-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator."}
