{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin", "notes": "Very spacious 78-ping unfurnished apartment marketed through Elegant Realty for expats. The living area has ornate ceiling moldings and polished marble floors with a dated 1990s-style aesthetic; the kitchen has older white tile and gas range/oven appliances that look functional but not modern. Bedrooms are large with wood-laminate flooring and decent natural light from large windows with window-unit AC. For baby safety, the marble floors in the living area are very slippery, and the kitchen has an open gas stove at child height; no balcony railings are visible but the unit appears to be on 3F without an obvious elevator, which could be inconvenient with a stroller."}
