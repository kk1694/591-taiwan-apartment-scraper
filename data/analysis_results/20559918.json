{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency) with elegant crystal chandeliers, recessed lighting, central AC, modern kitchen with Panasonic fridge and gas stove, and polished tile/wood flooring throughout. The spacious 36-ping layout with multiple rooms is very suitable for a family; floors are smooth and flat with no visible stairs, and corners appear rounded or standard — though the hard tile in the living area could be slippery for a crawling baby. Large windows in bedrooms provide good natural light, and the unit appears completely empty/clean and move-in ready with no red flags."}
