{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with white minimalist decor, good natural light from large windows, and fully furnished with appliances including washer, fridge, microwave, and AC. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need covering, and there's a visible balcony with railings that should be checked for gaps. The space is single-level with no stairs, making it reasonably baby-friendly once minor hazards are addressed."}
