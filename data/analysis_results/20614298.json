{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Upscale, well-finished apartment with polished marble floors throughout, recessed ceiling lighting, built-in cabinetry, central AC, and decorative wall panels. The unit is very spacious at ~40 ping with multiple bedrooms. For baby safety: the highly polished marble floors are slippery and could be hazardous for a crawling/walking baby — rugs or mats recommended. No stairs visible (single-level unit), and windows appear to have curtains but window guard status is unclear. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder) which is a minor red flag — verify full terms and layout details in person."}
