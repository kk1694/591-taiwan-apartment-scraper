{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment with high-end finishes including wood paneling, marble floors, recessed ceiling AC, and a large modern kitchen with island and full-size refrigerator. The spacious living/dining area has large sliding glass doors to a balcony. For baby safety, note the decorative lattice divider near what appears to be stairs (visible in image 1, left side), the balcony access with sliding doors, and hard tile floors throughout — stair gates and floor padding would be advisable. The listing description is minimal (just a promotional placeholder), which is a minor red flag; verify layout details and actual room count in person."}
