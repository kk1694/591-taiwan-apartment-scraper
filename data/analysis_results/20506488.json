{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment in an upscale building with rooftop pool, garden terrace, and gym facilities. Living room features quality wood flooring, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture with a glass coffee table that has sharp corners (baby safety concern). The building appears to be a high-end residential complex with excellent amenities, suggesting elevator access given the 6th floor location and premium nature."}
