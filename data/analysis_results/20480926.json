{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang", "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment in a high-end residential complex with decorative iron gates, landscaped courtyard, and a building gym. Interior features stylish design with textured accent wall, hardwood flooring, recessed lighting, glass-paned French doors, and quality furniture including a large solid wood dining table. The building is 10 floors with elevator access. For baby safety, the unit appears mostly flat with no visible stairs, though the glass doors and sharp-cornered furniture (dining table, side tables) would need childproofing. Natural light appears moderate from windows visible in the living area. The listing description is minimal (just a generic agent promotion), which is a minor red flag — request more details about layout, number of rooms, and lease terms before committing at this price point."}
