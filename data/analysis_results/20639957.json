{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with sleek open-plan kitchen featuring marble countertops, glass partitions, recessed LED lighting, and wood-look flooring throughout. The unit is spacious at 48 ping with multiple rooms including a large master bedroom with built-in closets. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows in the living area lack visible safety bars or locks which would need childproofing, and the open kitchen island has sharp marble corners; however, the flat layout with no stairs is a plus. The unit is clean and bright with good natural light from multiple windows, and the 5th floor location in Da'an district is desirable."}
