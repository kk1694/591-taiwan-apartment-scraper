{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-renovated apartment with modern light wood flooring, recessed lighting, open kitchen with island counter, built-in oven, and large stainless steel sink. The unit is unfurnished and very clean with large sliding glass windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors with railings visible outside, and the kitchen has an open layout with accessible countertop corners that may need baby-proofing. At 40 ping in Da'an district on 3F/6F, this is a premium family-sized unit; no elevator info available but older 6-floor buildings in Taiwan often lack elevators, which could be inconvenient with a stroller."}
