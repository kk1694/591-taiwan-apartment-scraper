{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment with mezzanine level accessed by stairs, managed by UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly agency). The unit is clean with glossy tile floors, modern kitchen with microwave and fridge, digital door lock, AC, and good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Major baby safety concern: the open staircase to the loft/mezzanine has low railings and no gate, which is dangerous for a crawling baby or toddler; the loft area itself has an open edge with only a low railing. The space is compact but well-furnished and in excellent condition for Da'an district."}
