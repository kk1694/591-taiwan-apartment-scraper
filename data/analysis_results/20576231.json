{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with stylish finishes including recessed lighting, frosted glass partition, built-in cabinetry, wood-panel accents, and concrete-textured accent walls. The space appears clean and well-maintained with good artificial lighting, though only the bedroom shows a window with curtains suggesting some natural light. The living area is quite narrow and compact for 22 ping, which may feel tight with baby gear; the frosted glass partition near the entryway could be a concern for a crawling toddler. High floor (11F/26F) in a modern tower strongly suggests elevator access."}
