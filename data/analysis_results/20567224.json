{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with contemporary finishes including recessed lighting, sleek cabinetry, and designer fixtures. The open-plan master bedroom with bathtub and the well-equipped kitchen suggest quality renovations. For baby safety, the open bathtub in the bedroom area and shelf units with accessible cubby holes are concerns; natural light appears moderate with some windows, but overall the apartment is clean and well-maintained."}
