{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious apartment with dated but well-maintained fixtures from early 2000s era - the bathroom has older wooden ceiling, the living room has dated cream/beige color scheme and built-in cabinetry. The windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, and the apartment appears clean with no visible mold or damage. For a family with a baby, the glass coffee table with sharp corners would need child-proofing, and the small study room could serve as a nursery."}
