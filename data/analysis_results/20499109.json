{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean white floors, recessed LED lighting, stylish pendant lamps, and high-quality built-in cabinetry throughout. The open kitchen-dining area is well-equipped with modern appliances, and the bedrooms have large windows with good natural light. For baby safety, the flat tile floors are smooth with no stairs visible, windows appear to have secure frames without dangerous openings, and no exposed balconies are visible — though the sharp-edged live-edge dining table and low coffee table corners would need padding. At 30 ping on the 6th floor of a 10-story building, it very likely has an elevator; overall an excellent, clean, move-in-ready space suitable for a family with a baby."}
