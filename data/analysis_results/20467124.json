{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, newly renovated apartment in excellent condition with stylish wood-panel accent wall, recessed LED lighting, floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors, split-system AC, and clean tile/wood flooring throughout multiple rooms. The balcony has metal railings with reasonable spacing but would need baby-proofing as the gaps could be a concern for a crawling toddler; the large sliding glass doors also need child locks. Abundant natural light from expansive windows on multiple sides; the unit appears unfurnished and very clean with no visible red flags — a solid option at 26 ping for a growing family, though 4F with no confirmed elevator could be inconvenient with a stroller."}
