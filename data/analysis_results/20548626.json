{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, crystal chandelier, split AC units, and a sleek modern kitchen with large refrigerator and range hood. The unit is spacious at 59 ping with good natural light from large windows with balcony access. For baby safety, the balcony railings visible through the sliding doors should be checked for spacing width, and the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from soft mats; no stairs are visible and corners appear relatively rounded. The unit is completely empty/unfurnished, so all furniture would need to be provided, which allows choosing baby-safe options but adds significant move-in cost."}
