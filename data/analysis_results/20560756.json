{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment in a stylish contemporary building with distinctive angular balconies. Interior features hardwood flooring, built-in white cabinetry, recessed lighting, and a glass-enclosed bathroom. The balcony has glass railings which are a concern for baby safety and would need additional barriers. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with good natural light from the balcony. At ~65 sqm with only 4 images showing what looks like a studio or 1-bedroom layout, it may feel tight for a couple with a baby despite the premium Xinyi location."}
