{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment on 11th floor with dated decor from 2000s-2010s era, featuring dark hardwood floors and purple leather furniture that appears worn. Excellent natural light from large balcony windows with mountain views. For baby safety: balcony has solid railings but sliding doors need child locks; glass coffee table with sharp corners is a concern. The unit is clean but furnishings are showing age."}
