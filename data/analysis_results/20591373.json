{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in very clean condition with modern finishes including recessed lighting, stone accent wall, new kitchen cabinetry with glass backsplash, and a stylish bathroom with clawfoot tub and modern toilet. Listed as 5F/4F which likely means a top-floor unit with rooftop addition in an older walkup building with no elevator — carrying a stroller up 5 floors is a major concern. The polished tile floors throughout are slippery which is a baby safety risk, and the freestanding bathtub lacks safety rails; the laundry/utility area has a floor drain and could be slippery when wet."}
