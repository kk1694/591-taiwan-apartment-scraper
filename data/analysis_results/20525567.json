{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a clean but dated 1F apartment in Neihu with older-style wooden furniture and traditional Taiwanese cabinetry. The living room has good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows/doors opening to a ground-level patio area, and the kitchen is functional with a gas stove and large refrigerator. Being on the 1st floor is convenient for a family with a baby (no stairs needed), but the ground-level access and patio door could pose security concerns, and the bedroom appears small with the bed taking up most of the space; the 40-ping size at NT$60k/month is reasonable for Neihu but the listing description is minimal (just an agent promotion), which is a minor red flag."}
