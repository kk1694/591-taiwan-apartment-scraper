{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with clean white/wood finishes, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and light wood-tone flooring throughout. The space is spacious at ~45 ping with multiple rooms, good natural light from large sliding glass doors/windows, and appears very clean. For baby safety, the raised platform bed area in one room has edges to be mindful of, and the balcony sliding doors should be secured; no visible dangerous stairs or sharp corners. The 12-story building on the 4th floor almost certainly has an elevator, and the listing description is minimal (agent promotional text only) but the quality of renovation and Sung Hsin Real Estate branding suggest a premium property."}
