{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). The unit features a sleek living room with built-in TV wall, modern kitchen with washing machine and ample counter space, and a bedroom with large wardrobe. Major baby safety concern: image 4 shows a loft/mezzanine area accessed by a steep ladder with open railings, which is dangerous for a crawling baby or toddler. The space is clean with good natural light from large windows, but at 12.53 ping it will feel tight for a couple with a baby, especially given the narrow layout."}
