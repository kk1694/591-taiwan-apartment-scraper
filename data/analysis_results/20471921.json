{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated European-inspired decor from the 1990s-2000s era, featuring ornate moldings, decorative columns, and dark marble-look floors. The space is very large and open but appears cluttered with the current tenant's belongings. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners and hard marble-like floors are concerns; no visible balcony railings or stairs in photos. Natural light appears adequate from windows but the space feels somewhat dim overall."}
