{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, recently renovated apartment with modern light wood flooring, new sofa, large TV, and updated kitchen with white cabinets and microwave. Good natural light from multiple windows with blinds. For baby safety, the space has minimal sharp corners but exposed cables near TV need management, and windows have standard railings. Being on 3F of a 4F building with no visible elevator info suggests a walk-up."}
