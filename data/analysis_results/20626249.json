{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou, near mountains", "notes": "Very modern, unfurnished apartment on the top floor (14F) with clean white tile flooring, recessed lighting, and excellent natural light from large windows with mountain views. The unit is in pristine move-in condition with no visible wear. For baby safety, the large windows appear secure with no balcony visible, and the open floor plan with no stairs is favorable; however, the hard tile floors would benefit from rugs or mats. Being a 14-story building it almost certainly has an elevator. A potential concern is that the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), so details on kitchen, bathrooms, and lease terms would need to be confirmed directly."}
