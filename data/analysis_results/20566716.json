{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment (34 ping) in decent but dated condition with wood-look laminate flooring, built-in cabinetry, and a renovated kitchen with modern white cabinets and gas stove. The apartment has multiple bedrooms with windows providing some natural light, though windows appear to face close neighboring buildings. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is good, but the small raised thresholds between rooms and round doorknobs could be concerns; no dangerous balcony access is visible. At 4F with no elevator confirmed, carrying a stroller up stairs daily could be a significant issue for a couple with a baby."}
