{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment with stylish white/cream finishes, light wood flooring, built-in cabinetry, and an open kitchen with breakfast bar. Managed by UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly rental agency). Being on 13F/13F of what appears to be a high-rise building, it almost certainly has an elevator; the high floor offers good natural light and city views. For baby safety, the window seat area in the bedroom has a raised platform a child could fall from, and the kitchen bar stools are transparent acrylic which could tip; however the overall layout is single-level with no stairs and rounded furniture edges, which is positive."}
