{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio-style apartment with stylish track lighting, split AC, digital door lock, and designer furniture. Bathroom is newly renovated with large-format tiles, glass shower partition, and modern toilet with bidet. Major concern for a couple with a baby: this appears to be a compact open-plan studio (bed and sofa in same room, no separate bedroom), the black metal ladder-style shelf has climbable rungs and sharp edges, and at 13 ping it will be quite tight for a family. No windows or natural light visible in any photo, which is a red flag — the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), providing no useful details about the property."}
