{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with clean condition but dated fixtures including a window AC unit and older-style fluorescent lighting. Notable baby safety concern: there is a significant raised platform/step between rooms that could be a fall hazard for crawling infants. Natural light is moderate through several windows with security grilles. Built-in shelving and sliding closet doors are functional but the overall style is from the 1990s-2000s era."}
