{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, dark marble-look tile flooring, and built-in media shelving. Excellent natural light from large windows. For baby safety, note the hard tile floors throughout the main areas (would need rugs/padding), and there appears to be a raised platform/step area in the kitchen zone visible in image 4 which could be a tripping hazard for toddlers. The balcony visible through windows has standard railings. Overall very clean and move-in ready condition."}
