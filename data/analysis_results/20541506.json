{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older Taiwanese apartment with dated 1980s-90s style decor including textured ceiling tiles, teal built-in cabinetry, and retro fixtures. The apartment is spacious and clean with multiple rooms and nice mountain views from Beitou. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners and lack of window guards visible are concerns; tile floors throughout are easy to clean but hard if baby falls."}
