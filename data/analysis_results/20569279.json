{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongxiao Yanji area", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern light wood flooring, recessed lighting, and fresh white walls. The unit is on 1F with a private outdoor courtyard/patio area. Baby safety considerations: the flat single-level layout is good, but the courtyard has no barriers and leads to an alley; windows have security grilles. Natural light appears limited due to surrounding buildings. Clean, move-in ready condition."}
