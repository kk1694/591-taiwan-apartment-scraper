{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Spacious but dated apartment with rustic/bohemian styling featuring exposed wooden beams, worn hardwood floors, and older kitchen appliances. The glass coffee table with sharp edges, a ladder leaning against the wall in the bedroom, and what appears to be a loft access ladder are significant baby safety concerns. Good natural light from large balcony doors, but the floors show considerable wear and the kitchen feels cramped and outdated; the glass partition doors in the dining area also pose a risk for a toddler."}
