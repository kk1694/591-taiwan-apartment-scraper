{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with light wood laminate flooring in the living area and darker hardwood in the bedroom. The unit is spacious at 33 ping with a separate kitchen featuring a gas stove, full-size fridge, and ample counter space. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent), suggesting it is foreigner-friendly. Good natural light from the living room windows with a small balcony area visible. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is ideal; furniture corners on the dining table and coffee table are relatively rounded, though the gas stove in the kitchen would need a safety gate. Being on the 4th floor of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
