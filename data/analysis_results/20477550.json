{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a stylish renovated apartment with a distinctive rustic/industrial aesthetic featuring exposed wooden beam ceilings, warm orange walls, and terracotta tile floors. The space appears clean and well-maintained with quality furniture. For baby safety, the metal bed frame has sharp corners, open shelving units could be climbing hazards, and the coffee table has hard edges - some childproofing would be needed. Good natural light from multiple windows with wooden blinds."}
