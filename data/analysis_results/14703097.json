{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 3-bedroom unfurnished apartment with recently installed light-colored laminate flooring and freshly painted white walls, but older-style wooden cabinetry and dated window frames suggest a renovated older building rather than a truly modern unit. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access; the balcony has metal railings that would need baby-proofing, and the sliding glass doors to the balcony are a potential pinch hazard for small children. The unit is very bare and clean with no kitchen or bathroom visible in photos, and the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — verify actual amenities, kitchen condition, and lease terms before visiting."}
