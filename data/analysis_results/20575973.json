{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wenshan District", "notes": "Brand new, high-end unfurnished apartment on the 20th floor of a 29-story building with luxury finishes including recessed LED lighting, polished marble-look tile floors, built-in cabinetry with accent shelving, and a video intercom system. The unit has floor-to-ceiling windows with excellent natural light and mountain views, plus a balcony with dark metal railings that appear adequately high for baby safety. The completely empty unfurnished state means you would need to purchase all furniture and appliances, but also means no sharp corners or hazards currently — a good opportunity to baby-proof from the start. The slippery polished tile floors could be a concern for a crawling baby and would benefit from area rugs."}
