{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very well-renovated modern apartment with designer finishes including recessed LED lighting, stylish grey accent walls, wood-grain vinyl flooring, a sleek open kitchen with marble-look cabinets and black granite countertops, and a bar-style kitchen island. The living space is spacious at 55 ping with good natural light from large shuttered windows. For baby safety, the open kitchen island with bar stools and glass shelving in the appliance cabinet area could be hazards; the windows appear to have security grilles which is good, but being on the top floor (15F/15F) means potential roof leak risk and summer heat exposure. The listing description is essentially empty (just a promotional ad), which is a minor red flag."}
