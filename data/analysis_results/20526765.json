{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Tianmu", "notes": "Traditional Taiwanese apartment with dated wooden furniture and window AC units, but spacious and well-maintained. The 1st floor location eliminates stair concerns but being on ground floor with accessible windows requires attention for baby safety. Good natural light through windows; kitchen is narrow with older fixtures but functional with modern LG refrigerator."}
