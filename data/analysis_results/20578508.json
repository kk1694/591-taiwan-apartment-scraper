{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a clean but dated apartment with older-style fixtures including traditional ceiling lights and tile floors throughout. The unit is unfurnished with built-in wooden wardrobes showing some age. For baby safety, the balcony has railings visible through sliding glass doors that appear adequate, and the flat tile floors are easy to clean though slippery. The space is spacious at 50 ping with good natural light from the balcony, but the overall aesthetic is 1990s-2000s Taiwan style rather than modern."}
