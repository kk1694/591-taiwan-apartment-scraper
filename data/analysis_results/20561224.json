{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, unfurnished apartment in clean condition with polished tile floors, split AC units, and multiple rooms visible — appears to be at least 2-3 bedrooms, spacious at 25.84 ping. The unit has good natural light from large sliding glass doors leading to a small balcony with metal railings that appear adequate but would need baby-proofing; the balcony railing gaps should be checked in person. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency) which is a positive sign, though the listing is essentially empty (no furniture/kitchen/bathroom shown) and the description is just a generic agent ad with no real property details — a red flag suggesting limited transparency."}
