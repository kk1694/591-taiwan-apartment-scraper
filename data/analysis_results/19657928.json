{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment with modern recessed/cove lighting, white leather sofas, marble-top coffee table, crystal chandelier in dining area, and polished tile floors throughout. The spacious living room has large arched windows with good natural light overlooking greenery. For baby safety, the marble coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the polished tile floors could be slippery; a balcony is visible through the windows which should be checked for railing safety. Listed by UR HOUSE (a foreign-focused rental agency), the 9-story building almost certainly has an elevator, and the overall condition is excellent with no visible red flags."}
