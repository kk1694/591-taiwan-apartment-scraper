{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District, near Shilin area based on visible real estate ads (昇陽芙林 Shilin reference, Chunghwa Telecom visible on street)", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with stylish interior design, recessed lighting, light wood flooring, and contemporary furnishings. The living room is clean with a sofa, coffee table, TV, and decorative wall art. The bathroom has modern fixtures with a bathtub and glass partition. The bedroom has a balcony with sliding glass doors providing good natural light, AC, and a large bed. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that need padding, the balcony railing height should be verified in person, and the bathtub area lacks a non-slip mat. The building is on the 4th floor of a 14-story building, very likely to have an elevator. The listing description is minimal (just an agent promotion), which is a minor red flag — request more details about layout and amenities."}
