{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District, near city skyline view (Taipei 101 visible from bedroom window)", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in a luxury high-rise tower (22F/26F) with premium finishes throughout. Kitchen features high-end Bosch built-in oven/microwave and Teka induction cooktop, white glossy cabinetry, and wood-laminate flooring. Living area is clean and minimalist with recessed lighting and split AC. Bedroom has large windows with panoramic city views. For baby safety: the unit appears to be a flat single-level layout with no stairs, windows have secure dark-framed panels, and no dangerous balcony railings are visible; the kitchen door to the utility balcony has a secure louvered gate. The building exterior is an upscale modern tower with a grand lobby entrance, confirming elevator access. Very clean, bright, and well-maintained — a strong option for a couple with a baby."}
