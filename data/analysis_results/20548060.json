{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious furnished apartment with dated but well-maintained decor — dark fabric sofas, glass coffee table with sharp corners, glass dining table, and mirrored walls give it a 2000s-era aesthetic rather than modern. The kitchen has granite countertops and decent cabinetry but older appliances. Good natural light from large windows; the glass table and sharp-cornered coffee table are baby safety concerns, but the smooth tile floors and open living space are positives. Listed via ULive Real Estate agent; the description is minimal (just a broker ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout, bedrooms, and building amenities before committing at NT$70K."}
