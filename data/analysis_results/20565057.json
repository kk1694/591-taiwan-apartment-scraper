{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This is a 1st-floor unit in an older 5-story walkup building with recently laid laminate wood flooring but otherwise dated fixtures — older AC units, basic ceiling lights, and exposed beams. The space is completely unfurnished and very open, which is good for baby-proofing, but the glass front door opening directly to the street raises security and safety concerns for a crawling child. Natural light appears limited with small windows, and the ground-floor street-level entrance with a commercial-style glass door suggests this unit may have previously been a shop or mixed-use space rather than a standard residential apartment."}
