{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white finishes, recessed LED lighting, and stainless steel appliances. The unit has a balcony with floor-to-ceiling glass doors which will need baby gates or guards once the child is mobile. Living space appears clean with minimal sharp corners on furniture; the bar stools are somewhat unstable for a home with a toddler. Being on 3F of a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
