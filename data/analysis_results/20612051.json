{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, wood-panel aesthetics, and quality fixtures including wall-mounted TV, AC, and modern lighting. The space appears very clean with no obvious sharp corners, though the glass coffee table and small balcony with glass railings are minor baby safety considerations. Natural light is adequate through the windows. Being on 8F/8F (top floor), elevator status is uncertain - worth confirming as this would be essential with a baby."}
