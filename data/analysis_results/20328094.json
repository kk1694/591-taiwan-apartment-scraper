{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with fresh white walls, polished tile floors, and new furniture. The unit appears to be a multi-room flat on the 7th floor of a 21-story building (very likely has elevator). However, it appears to be set up as a shared/partitioned rental with only single beds in small rooms, which is a major red flag for a couple expecting a baby — the bedrooms are tiny and furnished with single beds, suggesting this may be rented by the room rather than as a whole unit. Natural light appears limited with small windows; no visible balcony safety concerns but the rooms feel cramped for a growing family."}
