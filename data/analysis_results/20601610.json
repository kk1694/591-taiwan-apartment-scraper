{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with clean white walls, recessed LED lighting, built-in ceiling AC, and contemporary leather sofa. The space appears well-maintained with quality finishes including a digital door lock. Being on the 24th floor of a 26-story building strongly indicates elevator access. No obvious baby hazards visible in this image, though the tile floors may be slippery; would need to see more rooms to assess balcony and other safety concerns."}
