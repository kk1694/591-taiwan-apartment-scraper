{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment on 8F/10F with recessed LED lighting, built-in cabinetry, polished tile floors, and split AC units. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors and windows with city views. The balcony has glass railings which are a concern for baby safety and should be checked for height/gaps; the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery. A children's play mat is visible suggesting previous family use. The apartment is unfurnished and very clean, spacious at 51.59 ping — great for a growing family, though the description is minimal (agent listing with no detail)."}
