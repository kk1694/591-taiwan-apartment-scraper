{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, stylishly renovated apartment with recessed LED lighting, sleek built-in cabinetry, and polished floors in excellent condition. Being on the 3rd floor of a 26-story building strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, note the glass coffee table with sharp edges and high bar stools that could be hazards; natural light appears limited as windows are covered by heavy curtains in all photos."}
