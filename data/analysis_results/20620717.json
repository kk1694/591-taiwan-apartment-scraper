{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Spacious 40-ping unfurnished apartment with polished hardwood floors in the living area and light wood-tone tile in bedrooms; the living room has recessed lighting and glass partition shelving, but the two bathrooms are dated with old-style green fixtures, white tile, and aging grab bars. The large open living space has no major sharp corners but the glass partition/shelving near the entry area could be a baby safety concern, and the bathtub in the second bathroom would need supervision; natural light appears moderate from bedroom windows on the 8th floor. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — at NT$75,000/month you would expect detailed info, and the unit appears to be undergoing some renovation or move-out prep given paint cans and materials on the floor."}
