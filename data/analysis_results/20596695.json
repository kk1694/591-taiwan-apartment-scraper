{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with recessed ceiling lighting, wall-mounted AC units, and clean tiled floors throughout. The living room has large floor-to-ceiling windows with good natural light; at least two bedrooms visible (both with balcony access and new mattresses still in plastic wrap), plus a clean bathroom with bathtub. The balcony has metal railings that appear to have wide gaps between bars, which is a baby safety concern; the sliding glass doors to the balcony should be kept locked once the child is mobile. The glass-top marble coffee table in the living room has sharp edges that would need baby-proofing. Overall the apartment is spacious at 40 ping, clean, and in good condition for a family."}
