{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated finishes — decorative wood beam ceiling, wood-paneled bedrooms, old-style galley kitchen with stainless steel countertop, and a dated bathroom with bathtub. The unit is spacious (38 ping) and clean but unfurnished, with window-unit AC and window security bars; the living room gets decent natural light. For baby safety, the bathtub lacks a guard, the tile floors are slippery, and exposed electrical outlets are at low height; being on 2F of a walk-up building means no elevator is likely, which would be inconvenient with a stroller."}
