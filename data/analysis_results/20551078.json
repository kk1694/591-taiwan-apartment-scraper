{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale modern apartment with elegant finishes including marble-look tile walls, crystal chandeliers, LED cove lighting, and a well-equipped galley kitchen with LG refrigerator and gas cooktop. The balcony has traditional iron railings which could be a baby safety concern if gaps are wide enough for a child to fit through. Very clean condition with good natural light; the sharp-cornered glass coffee table would need baby-proofing."}
