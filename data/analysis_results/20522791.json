{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in near-new condition with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, modern light fixtures, polished tile floors, and an open kitchen with stainless steel appliances. The unit is very spacious at 64.4 ping with multiple large rooms, all featuring good natural light through large dark-framed windows. For baby safety, the polished tile floors could be slippery and would need rugs or mats; no dangerous balcony railings or stairs are visible, and corners appear relatively smooth. The unit is unfurnished and immaculately clean, listed through Chang-Sheng Real Estate; being on the 3rd floor of a 20-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
