{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern and stylishly renovated apartment with designer furniture, track lighting, polished tile floors, and a clawfoot bathtub with glass partition in the bathroom. The living room has large floor-to-ceiling glass walls leading to a covered balcony/terrace area with a glass roof and plants. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp wire-frame legs is a concern, the balcony glass panels need checking for secure latching, and the slippery polished tile floors throughout could be hazardous; however the space is very spacious at 60 ping with clean lines and minimal clutter, making it generally suitable with some baby-proofing."}
