{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern and stylishly renovated apartment with wood-grain paneling, white brick accent wall, recessed lighting, black-framed glass partition doors, and wood-look flooring. The space appears clean and well-maintained with contemporary finishes. For baby safety, the glass partition doors between rooms could be a concern, and sharp corners on the built-in TV console should be padded; natural light appears moderate from the visible window in the adjacent room. Listed through UR HOUSE rental management, suggesting professional property management."}
