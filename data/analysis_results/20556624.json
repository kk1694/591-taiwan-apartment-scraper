{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xiangyun Street, Xinyi District, near Taipei 101", "notes": "3BR/2BA whole-floor unit on 2F of a 7-story elevator building on Xiangyun Street, Xinyi District. Medium-quality renovation (3+ years old), comes furnished with appliances, has a balcony, cooking allowed, and pets allowed. Good for a family with baby—elevator access is a plus, but the 2nd floor balcony and medium-age renovation warrant an in-person check for baby safety (railing gaps, window locks, sharp corners); north-south ventilation suggests decent natural light and airflow."}
