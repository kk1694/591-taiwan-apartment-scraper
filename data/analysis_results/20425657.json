{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment with modern fixtures, elegant chandelier lighting, open-plan living/dining/kitchen, and abundant natural light from large windows with balcony access. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony with glass railings requires supervision for child safety. The space is very clean, spacious at 46 ping, and the 6th floor in a 10-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
