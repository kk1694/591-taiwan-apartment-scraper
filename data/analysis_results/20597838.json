{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a hotel-style studio apartment with modern fixtures, two double beds, recessed lighting, and a boutique hotel aesthetic. The unit is very clean with contemporary finishes and a glass-enclosed shower bathroom. However, the space is quite small (7 ping) with two beds taking up most of the room, limited natural light from one small window, and no visible kitchen - making it unsuitable for a family with a baby who would need space for a crib, baby supplies, and meal preparation."}
