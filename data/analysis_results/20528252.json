{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment (~35 ping) with polished hardwood floors, recessed ceiling lighting, split AC, and built-in dark wood cabinetry; managed by UR House (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). The unit is on the 10th floor of a 12-story building (almost certainly has an elevator), with good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the open layout with no stairs is a plus, but the low built-in cabinets have accessible handles and there are exposed electrical outlets near the floor that would need childproofing; no balcony or railing hazards are visible in the photos. Note: the listing is completely unfurnished and the description is minimal (just an agent ad blurb), so kitchen/bathroom condition is unknown."}
