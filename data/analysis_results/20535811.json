{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a ground-floor commercial/warehouse-style space rather than a residential apartment. The exterior shows a storefront with roll-up gates, and the listing text mentions it can be used as a store, warehouse, or residence. Interior has dated fixtures with old-style paneled walls, fluorescent lighting, and basic tile floors. For a family with a baby, concerns include the commercial nature of the space, lack of proper residential layout, limited natural light from small barred windows, and overall dated condition. Not suitable as a family home."}
