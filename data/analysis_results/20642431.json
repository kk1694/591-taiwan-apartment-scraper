{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean but dated apartment with older style kitchen, basic fixtures, and simple finishes. Good natural light from multiple windows with balcony access. For baby safety, the balcony has a railing but sliding door access will need childproofing; no stairs visible but low electrical outlets should be covered."}
