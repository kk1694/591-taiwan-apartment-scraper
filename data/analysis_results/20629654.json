{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated finishes but clean and well-maintained. Spacious living area with laminate flooring, basic kitchen with gas stove and older cabinets. Balcony visible with standard railings that may need childproofing for baby safety. Being on the 9th/top floor with no clear elevator evidence is a concern; the intercom panel suggests an older building that may lack elevator."}
