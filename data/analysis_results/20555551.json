{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment in excellent condition with sleek white cabinetry, recessed lighting, modern AC units, and quality built-in wardrobes. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent), suggesting foreigner-friendly. The space appears baby-safe with no visible stairs, smooth rounded furniture edges, and no open balconies shown; however, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. Good natural light filtered through large windows with zebra blinds in bedrooms. At 40 ping on the 10th floor of an 18-story building, an elevator is virtually certain. The minimal description is a red flag — it appears to be a generic agent placeholder rather than a detailed listing."}
