{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "This is a multi-story townhouse (透天厝) with a ground-floor entrance directly off the street, not a typical apartment. The ground floor has a storefront-like glass facade and appears to be an empty shell with tiled kitchen area and steep wooden staircase leading to upper floors — a major baby safety hazard. The upstairs bedroom has decent natural light from large windows but the overall condition is dated with older bathroom fixtures, window-unit AC, and basic finishes. The street-level entrance and commercial-looking ground floor raise concerns about whether this is purely residential; it may have been a former shop-house."}
