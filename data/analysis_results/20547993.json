{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment showing significant wear with peeling paint and water damage visible on bedroom walls and furniture. The unit has dated fixtures including old ceiling fans and 80s-style built-in cabinets. Baby safety concerns include a raised tatami-style platform with step edge in the living area and balcony access with sliding doors. Good natural light from balcony windows but the overall condition suggests deferred maintenance."}
