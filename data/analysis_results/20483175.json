{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment in good condition with tile flooring, AC, built-in wardrobes, a functional kitchen with gas stove and dish dryer, and a bright bathroom with window and bathtub. At 7F/18F in what appears to be a newer high-rise, the balcony has sliding glass doors but the railing height should be verified for baby safety; the flat layout with no stairs is good for a family. The listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — ask for more details about the layout and exact location in Datong district."}
