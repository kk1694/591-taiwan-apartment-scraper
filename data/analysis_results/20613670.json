{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with marble accent walls, split AC units, and good natural light through floor-to-ceiling windows. The unit has a loft/mezzanine area with low railings that could be a fall hazard for a crawling baby or toddler - the open ledge overlooking the living room is a significant safety concern. Glass balcony railings appear secure but the coffee table has sharp corners."}
