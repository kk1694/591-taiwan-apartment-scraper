{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated unfurnished apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, stylish concrete-effect TV accent wall with wood cabinetry, wall-mounted AC units, large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light, and a modern bathroom with glass-enclosed shower and bidet toilet. At 64.5 ping this is very spacious for a family. For baby safety: the polished tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling/toddling baby; the large floor-to-ceiling windows on the balcony side would need childproof locks; the glass shower door in the bathroom is a potential hazard. The apartment is unfurnished so you would need to buy all furniture. The 3rd floor of an 11-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Overall an excellent, clean, move-in ready space but budget for furnishing and baby-proofing."}
