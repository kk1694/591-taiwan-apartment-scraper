{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes, marble-look tile flooring, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture. The unit appears very clean and well-maintained with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the low coffee tables have rounded edges which is good, but the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedrooms would need safety bars or locks; no visible balcony railings or stairs to worry about."}
