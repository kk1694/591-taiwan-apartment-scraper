{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious 47-ping apartment on 2F of a 15-story building in decent but dated condition with older-style kitchen, window AC units, and vintage light fixtures. The balcony has glass panel railings at a reasonable height which is positive for baby safety, but the open kitchen pass-through counter and balcony sliding doors would need childproofing. Good natural light from large windows and balcony with a pleasant tree-lined street view; listed through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency which specializes in foreign tenants, but the minimal listing description is a red flag suggesting this may be an agent placeholder listing."}
