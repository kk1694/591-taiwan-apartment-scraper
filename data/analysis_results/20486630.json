{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylish apartment with high-end finishes including marble-look flooring, recessed AC, designer lighting, and a wall-mounted TV. The bedroom is on a loft/mezzanine level with only a low curved glass panel as a railing, which is a serious baby safety hazard — a crawling or toddling child could easily fall from the elevated sleeping area. The space is clean and well-designed but compact; natural light appears limited due to dark blinds on the windows. At NT$80,000/month for ~23 ping in Datong, this is premium-priced and likely a newer building with elevator on the 6th of 14 floors."}
