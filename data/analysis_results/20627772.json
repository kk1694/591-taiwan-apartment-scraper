{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with open kitchen featuring island counter, track lighting, and new cabinetry. Spacious bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and AC units. The enclosed balcony has safety mesh on windows which is good for baby safety. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a baby. Tile floors throughout are clean but may be slippery; the balcony area appears secure with enclosed windows."}
