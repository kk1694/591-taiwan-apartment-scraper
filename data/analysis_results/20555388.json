{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with clean minimalist design, light wood cabinetry, and good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. The balcony has horizontal railings that could be a concern for a crawling baby - would need safety netting. The unit appears well-maintained with central AC, built-in storage, and a small separate kitchen area."}
