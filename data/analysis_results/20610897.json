{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including basic kitchen cabinets and simple bathroom with wet floor design. Clean condition but shows age with yellowed walls and older-style tile flooring throughout. For baby safety, the windows have security bars which is good, but the kitchen has access to a small balcony that would need childproofing. Natural light is moderate through small windows. Spacious layout at 37 ping with multiple rooms including separate kitchen area."}
