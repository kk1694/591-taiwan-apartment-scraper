{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated duplex with modern minimalist design, excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows, and polished concrete floors. Baby safety concerns: internal staircase with open railings needs childproofing, and large glass partitions/sliding doors could be hazardous. The space is very clean and bright but the internal stairs make it less ideal for a family with an infant or toddler."}
