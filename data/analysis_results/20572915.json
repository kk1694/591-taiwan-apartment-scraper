{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Longjiang Road, Zhongshan District", "notes": "This is a ground-floor COMMERCIAL STOREFRONT currently operating as a phone repair shop (Phone Captain), NOT a residential apartment. The images show a retail display counter with phones, a cluttered back workspace, a tiny kitchenette crammed next to a fridge, and an empty room with office-style fluorescent lighting and vertical blinds. Completely unsuitable for a couple with a baby — it is a commercial space on a busy street with no proper living facilities, no bedroom, no bathroom visible, and the street-facing glass storefront offers no privacy or security for a child."}
