{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Spacious and clean renovated apartment with polished tile floors, modern built-in TV wall unit, at least 3 bedrooms, a dining area, and a balcony visible from the dining room. Good natural light from multiple windows in each room. For baby safety, the polished tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling/walking toddler, and the balcony access from the dining area should be checked for secure railings; the open shelving unit with metal frame in one bedroom has sharp edges worth noting. Being on the 5th floor of a 6-floor building with no clear elevator evidence, carrying a stroller up stairs could be a significant daily challenge."}
