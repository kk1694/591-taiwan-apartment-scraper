{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed lighting, split AC, light wood flooring, and sleek white built-in cabinetry. The open layout with no visible stairs and smooth rounded cabinet edges is generally baby-safe, though exposed electrical cables on the floor need addressing. Building exterior shows a well-maintained 22-story high-rise with landscaping, strongly indicating elevator access on floor 7."}
