{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed ceiling lighting, furnished living room and at least two bedrooms with matching furniture. The bathroom has a bathtub and separate shower area with dark marble floor tiles. At 48.2 ping on the 10th floor of a 13-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from soft mats, and the sharp corners on the coffee table and TV stand should be padded; no dangerous balcony or staircase situations visible. Good natural light from multiple windows in both living areas and bedrooms."}
