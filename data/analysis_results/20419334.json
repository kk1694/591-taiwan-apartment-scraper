{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District, Taipei 103022", "notes": "Clean, modern unfurnished apartment with new wood-grain flooring, modern white kitchen with induction cooktop, microwave, and glass backsplash. The unit appears to be a studio or open-plan layout with exposed ceiling pipes giving an industrial-loft feel; there is a balcony with sliding glass doors and sheer curtains providing good natural light. For baby safety, the balcony access will need childproofing and the exposed ceiling pipes/hanging light fixtures should be secured, but the flat open floor plan with no stairs and no sharp corners is generally baby-friendly. At 19.76 ping on the 5th floor of a 19-story building (very likely has an elevator), this is a decent size but may feel tight for a couple with a baby given it appears to be a single open room plus kitchen."}
