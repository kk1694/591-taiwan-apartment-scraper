{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained studio/1-bedroom apartment in a newer building with clean tile floors, recessed LED lighting, split AC, built-in kitchen with glossy cabinets, microwave/oven, and an air purifier. The balcony has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors providing good natural light, but the balcony railing area could be a concern for a toddler and the rolling metal side table has sharp corners. At 11 ping this is quite compact for a couple with a baby; the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and bedroom separation."}
