{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern, well-renovated duplex/loft-style apartment in excellent condition with stylish wood finishes, recessed lighting, and quality appliances including a Tatung refrigerator and built-in dishwasher. Baby safety concern: there are internal stairs connecting the two levels with a thin railing that would need childproofing. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access; the balcony has horizontal railings that may need safety netting once the baby becomes mobile."}
