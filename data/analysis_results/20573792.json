{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, well-furnished apartment with European-style crown molding, modern wall-mounted TV, sliding glass doors, and clean white tile flooring. The unit appears recently renovated with quality finishes including a padded headboard, built-in wardrobes, and marble coffee table. For baby safety, the extensive glass sliding doors and partitions between rooms are a concern as a crawling toddler could bump into them; the hard tile floors would also benefit from play mats. Natural light appears limited based on the nighttime photos, but the unit has large windows with curtains. At 23 ping on 7F of a 14-story building, it very likely has an elevator and offers decent space for a small family."}
