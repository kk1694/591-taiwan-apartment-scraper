{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern finishes, open-plan living/kitchen area, recessed lighting, and clean white surfaces. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the bar stools near the kitchen counter could be a climbing hazard. Natural light appears limited with only glass block windows visible, but interior is bright with good artificial lighting. Being on 5F of a 15F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
