{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-quality modern apartment with polished hardwood floors throughout, recessed lighting, crown molding, and built-in wooden cabinetry and shelving. The rooms are spacious and very clean with good natural light from large windows with curtains and blinds. For baby safety, one room shows floor-to-ceiling windows with a small balcony railing visible, and the tall built-in bookshelves could be a tipping hazard; the unit is unfurnished which is good for childproofing. At 56 ping on 3F/9F in Nangang, this appears to be a well-maintained upscale residential building that almost certainly has an elevator."}
