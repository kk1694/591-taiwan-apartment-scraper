{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including basic ceiling lights, window AC units, and aging tile floors showing wear. The balcony has metal grid railings which could be a climbing hazard for toddlers and would need childproofing. Good natural light from large windows but the unit appears unfurnished and somewhat bare with visible wiring and cables on floors. Being on the top floor (12/12) may mean potential roof leak issues and heat concerns."}
