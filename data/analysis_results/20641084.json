{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with recessed LED lighting, quality wood furniture, and clean tiled floors. The unit appears to have 2 bedrooms including a smaller room that could work as a nursery. For baby safety, the coffee table has some sharp corners, and the large sliding glass door to the balcony would need child locks; otherwise no major hazards visible. Natural light seems limited based on nighttime photos, but windows are present in all rooms with curtains."}
