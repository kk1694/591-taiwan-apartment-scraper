Kitchen is clean with modern gas stove and range hood. Baby safety concerns: balcony has horizontal railings that could be climbable, and the balcony railing shows some rust which may indicate aging; low coffee tables with sharp corners in living room. Good natural light from balcony. Building appears to be in a modern high-rise complex (6F/15F suggests elevator)."}
