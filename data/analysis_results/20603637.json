{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment (35.66 ping) on 9F of a 21-story building, fully furnished with dated but well-maintained wooden cabinetry and tile floors. The unit has at least two bedrooms, a living room, dining area, and separate kitchen; the glass coffee table with sharp corners and raised wooden platform steps in the second bedroom are baby safety concerns. The apartment appears clean with reasonable natural light from windows, though the window AC units and overall decor suggest 1990s-era finishes rather than modern renovation; no visible balcony railings or stairs, but the tile-to-wood floor transitions could be trip hazards for a crawling baby."}
