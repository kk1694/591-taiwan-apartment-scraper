{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, hotel-style studio with high-end finishes including recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, large floor-to-ceiling French windows, and sleek built-in wardrobes with marble-look flooring in the entryway. The unit is clean and well-maintained. Baby safety concerns include the ornate iron balcony railing accessible through the large glass doors, and the small size (7 ping) which will feel cramped for a couple with a baby. At NT$65,000/month for a studio this small, the price is very high; no kitchen or living space is visible, suggesting this may function more like a serviced apartment. Natural light appears decent from the large windows, though greenery outside partially blocks direct sunlight."}
