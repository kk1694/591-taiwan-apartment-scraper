{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with clean white walls, glossy tile floors, and contemporary furniture. Good natural light from multiple windows. The space appears clean and well-maintained with minimal furniture, which is good for baby safety. Being on 8F/8F (top floor) without confirmed elevator could be a concern with a baby and stroller."}
