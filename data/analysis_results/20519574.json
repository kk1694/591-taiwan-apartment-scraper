{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Luxurious, high-end apartment with premium finishes including marble floors, recessed lighting, marble TV feature wall, and elegant crown molding throughout. The unit is spacious at 46 ping with excellent natural light from large windows and a balcony with ornate iron railings — the balcony railing spacing should be checked for baby safety. The marble floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling baby; the raised platform area near the glass partition also poses a fall risk for toddlers. Managed by UR HOUSE (家合外商租屋管理), a rental service targeting foreign professionals, which is a plus for a foreign couple. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), so details on layout, bedrooms, and amenities are unclear — worth requesting more info."}
