{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Huanhe South Road Section 2 (環河南路二段), Wanhua District, near Longshan Temple MRT (480m)", "notes": "Recently renovated (within one year) 2BR/2BA full-floor residential unit on 2F of a 24-story building with elevator. Fully furnished and move-in ready with good natural light and a balcony. For a couple expecting a baby: the balcony should be checked for railing safety, the 2nd floor location is convenient, and the Wanhua/Longshan Temple area is lively but can be noisy and older-feeling. Pet-friendly policy is a plus. Note the additional NT$2,599/month management fee bringing effective cost to ~NT$45,600."}
