{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a multi-level townhouse-style apartment on 1F with internal stairs and a mezzanine/loft level with low wooden railings — a significant baby safety hazard. The unit is clean with tile floors downstairs and hardwood on the loft, but furnishings are dated (older wooden TV cabinet, traditional dining set, fluorescent lighting). Natural light appears limited on the ground floor with small windows and security grilles; the loft railing is low and open, posing a serious fall risk for a crawling toddler and would require extensive baby-proofing."}
