{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated studio/suite with high-end modern finishes including recessed LED lighting, built-in cabinetry, wood-look flooring, designer bathroom with glass shower partition, and a luxurious building lobby with marble reception desk and concierge — indicating a premium managed building with elevator on floor 15 of 21. For baby safety, the glass shower door and hard terrazzo bathroom floor are concerns; the unit appears to be a single open-plan room (studio layout) which may feel tight for a couple with a baby at ~42 sqm. Natural light comes from one window with zebra blinds; no visible balcony reduces fall risk but limits outdoor drying space."}
