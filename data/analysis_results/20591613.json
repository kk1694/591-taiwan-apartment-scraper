{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-furnished apartment with a European-style luxury aesthetic — ornate crown molding, crystal chandelier, padded headboard, decorative glass partition doors, and polished tile floors. The unit appears clean and in good condition with a wall-mounted TV, intercom system, and LED accent lighting. For baby safety, the slippery polished tile floors are a concern, the glass partition between living room and bedroom has sharp decorative metal frames, and the bedroom has a floor-to-ceiling window/balcony door that would need childproofing; natural light appears decent from the bedroom windows. At 23 ping on the 7th floor of a 14-story building, it very likely has an elevator, though the space may feel compact for a growing family despite the listed size."}
