{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylish studio apartment with high-end finishes, contemporary furniture, split AC, and good natural light from balcony. The unit has a loft area accessed by a metal ladder which poses a significant safety hazard for a baby/toddler - ladder has no gate and open railings above. Small space (7.5 ping) will be cramped for a couple with a baby; balcony appears accessible which requires childproofing."}
