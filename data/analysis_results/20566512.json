{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious, well-maintained apartment with marble floors, crystal chandeliers, and high-quality wood cabinetry throughout. The unit appears clean and spacious with good natural light from large windows. Baby safety considerations: the floors are hard marble/tile (slippery when wet), and cord blinds may need to be secured; no visible dangerous balconies or stairs in the photos. Some moving boxes visible suggest recent vacancy."}
