{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, newly finished apartment on the top floor (21F) with clean white tile floors, split AC units, modern kitchen with gas stove, Chimei fridge, and built-in microwave. The bedroom is very small with only a single bed, which is a significant concern for a couple — there is no visible double bed or space for one. For baby safety, the unit appears to have no stairs and smooth surfaces, but the listing mentions a balcony (陽台) which would need railing inspection at this height. Being on 21F of a 21-floor building strongly suggests elevator access. The description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — verify actual furnishing and layout in person."}
