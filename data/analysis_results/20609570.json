{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent condition — recently renovated with high-quality modern finishes including recessed LED ceiling lighting, sleek built-in cabinetry, marble-look tile flooring, modern kitchen with gas stove and range hood, and Panasonic split AC. Large windows provide abundant natural light and greenery views. For baby safety, the polished tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling/toddling child; furniture corners on the dining table and sideboard are relatively sharp. No balcony or stairs visible in the photos, which is a plus. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — request full details on layout, number of rooms, and lease terms directly."}
