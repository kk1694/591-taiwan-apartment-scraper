{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Upscale unfurnished apartment on the top floor (11F) with polished marble floors throughout, ornate crown molding, crystal chandeliers, and floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a balcony with mountain views. The open-plan kitchen has modern white cabinetry and a breakfast bar. For baby safety, the marble floors are very hard and slippery which is a concern for crawling/toddling; the balcony sliding doors need child locks, and the balcony railing height should be verified. The unit has excellent natural light from large windows but is completely empty — furnishing costs will be significant on top of the NT$73,000 rent. The description is minimal (just an agent promo), which is a minor red flag — request a full viewing to check bathroom condition, bedroom count, and actual balcony safety."}
