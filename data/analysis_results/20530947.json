{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "This listing at NT$100,000/month for 58 ping in Beitou on the 2nd floor of a 13-story building suggests a mid-to-high-end apartment. The 13-story building almost certainly has an elevator. The description is minimal (just a promotional message for the agent's listing package), providing no details about the apartment's condition, layout, or amenities, which is a red flag — the lack of description and unknown layout makes it difficult to assess baby safety features such as balcony railings, stairs, or sharp corners."}
