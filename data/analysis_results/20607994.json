{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, clean apartment with polished hardwood floors, modern light fixtures, and updated kitchen with white cabinets and large Panasonic refrigerator. The unit is on 10F of a 12-story building suggesting elevator access. Good natural light from multiple windows with city views. For baby safety: no visible balconies or dangerous railings in photos, flat single-level layout with no stairs, corners appear rounded on built-in cabinets - generally safe, though electrical outlets visible at floor level would need covers."}
