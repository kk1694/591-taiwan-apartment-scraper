{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a ground-floor commercial storefront converted for residential use, with large glass doors opening directly to the street where scooters and taxis are visible. The interior has steep wooden stairs with wide gaps between balusters posing serious fall hazards for a baby. The space lacks natural light separation from street-level traffic noise and has minimal privacy - not suitable for a family with an infant."}
