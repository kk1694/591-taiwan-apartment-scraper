{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with new light grey wood-look flooring throughout, modern built-in cabinetry with glass display shelves, recessed LED lighting, and an en-suite bathroom visible from the master bedroom. The space is very clean and move-in ready with at least 2-3 bedrooms, ample built-in storage including a large entryway shoe cabinet, and windows with security grilles providing natural light. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is ideal, corners on built-in furniture appear relatively rounded, and windows have metal security grilles which also serve as child safety barriers; however, the glass cabinet doors in the living area may need childproofing, and being on the 5th floor without a confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller."}
