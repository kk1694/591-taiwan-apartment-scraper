{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nanchanglu Section 2 (南昌路二段), Zhongzheng District, 1 min walk to Guoting MRT Station", "notes": "Recently renovated (within 1 year) 2BR/2BA apartment with mid-range finish in a 12-story elevator building with 24-hour security. All rooms have outward-facing windows providing good natural light; includes balcony, full furniture, and appliances. Good for a couple with baby: elevator access, security guard, cooking allowed with natural gas; however, the balcony should be checked for railing safety and gaps, and the overall 23-ping size is modest but workable for a small family. Pet-friendly and eligible for rental subsidies; NT$1,890/month management fee is additional cost."}
