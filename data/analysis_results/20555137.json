{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with clean white walls, contemporary furniture, and LVT flooring throughout. The spacious layout includes a living room, dining area, at least two bedrooms with ample storage. For baby safety, the low platform beds and rounded furniture edges are good, though outlet covers and corner protectors would be needed. Being on the 3rd floor of a 17-story building strongly indicates elevator access. Good natural light from windows, though some rooms appear to have limited window exposure."}
