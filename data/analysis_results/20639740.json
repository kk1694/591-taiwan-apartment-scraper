{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment in a modern high-rise (14-floor building on 2F, very likely has elevator). Spacious living room with good natural light from large sliding glass doors leading to a balcony with glass railings, tile flooring throughout, AC units in multiple rooms, and furnished with sofa set, TV, and beds. The balcony has glass panel railings which are a concern for a baby as they may not be tall enough; the glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing. Bathroom is basic but functional with a shower partition and bidet toilet; no kitchen photos were shown which is a notable gap for a family."}
