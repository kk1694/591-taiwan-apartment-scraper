{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with dark wood built-in cabinetry, recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, split AC units, and a spacious open living-dining layout. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the glossy tile floors could be slippery for a crawling toddler; being on the 1st floor of a 4-story walk-up means no elevator but also no stair-climbing with a stroller. The kitchen is fully equipped with gas stove, ample storage, and a separate enclosed cooking area, though natural light appears limited given the ground-floor position."}
