{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 35-ping unfurnished apartment with a dated but well-maintained interior featuring decorative stone accent walls, recessed ceiling lighting, dark wood cabinetry, and a separate country-style kitchen with dining area. The living area has clean tile floors and decent natural light; the stone wall edges and exposed utility plumbing could pose minor baby safety concerns, but the open floor plan is generally family-friendly. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent), the description is minimal placeholder text, which is a minor red flag — more photos of bedrooms and bathrooms would be needed to fully assess."}
