The unit appears newly renovated with white walls, tile flooring, and contemporary furniture. The bedroom has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a balcony with relatively low railings that would need baby-proofing; additionally, the glass coffee table corners could pose risks for a crawling child. Good natural light from large windows, and the space is bright and well-maintained."}
