{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end unfurnished apartment on the 11th floor of a 19-story building with luxury finishes including marble accent wall, recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, and quality wood-tone cabinetry. The balcony has decorative metal railings that appear reasonably safe but have wide gaps between vertical bars that could be a concern for a toddler — a balcony safety net would be advisable. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows, very clean brand-new condition; the unit is completely empty so would need all furniture, but the spacious 47 ping layout with no stairs is ideal for a family with a baby."}
