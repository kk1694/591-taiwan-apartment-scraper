{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, modern kitchen with induction cooktop, split AC units, and quality wood furniture. The space appears baby-safe with no visible stairs, low storage units, and rounded furniture edges, though the tall bookshelf in the bedroom may need securing. Good natural light from windows, very clean condition with neutral color palette and quality finishes throughout."}
