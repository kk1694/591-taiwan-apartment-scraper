{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious apartment with dated but well-maintained decor featuring polished hardwood floors, recessed lighting with cove lighting, and traditional-style furniture. The apartment has large windows with security grilles providing natural light, but the fixtures and decor (massage chair, heavy sofas, classical oil paintings) suggest an older style. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) without clear elevator indication is a concern; baby safety considerations include the low coffee tables with hard corners and older bedroom furniture with protruding edges."}
