{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with high-end finishes including recessed lighting, modern kitchen with built-in appliances, and custom wood cabinetry. The space appears clean and well-maintained with good natural light through blinds. For baby safety, the smooth floors and minimal sharp corners are positive, though the drum set would need to be removed; no visible balcony or stairs in the images."}
