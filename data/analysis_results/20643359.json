{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Luxury modern apartment with high-end finishes including marble accent walls, recessed LED lighting, built-in cabinetry, and premium furnishings. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agent). At least 2 bedrooms plus a study/office room with ergonomic chair. Large windows provide excellent natural light with views. For baby safety: the window bay seating areas have low sills that would need guards, and the round marble coffee table has smooth edges which is relatively safe; no visible balconies or dangerous railings. The unit is on the 11th floor of an 18-story building, strongly indicating elevator access. Very clean, move-in ready condition with air purifier included — an excellent choice for a family with a baby."}
