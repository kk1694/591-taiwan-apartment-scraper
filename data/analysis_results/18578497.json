{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with clean but dated finishes including tile floors, older-style AC units, and basic fixtures. The space appears to be on the top floor (6F/6F) with no visible elevator evidence. For a baby, the raised wooden platform area by the window could be a fall hazard, and the glass display cabinet has sharp edges. Natural light is decent from the large windows, and the apartment is clean but unfurnished with some cleaning supplies visible suggesting recent turnover."}
