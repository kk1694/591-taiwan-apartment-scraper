{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, newly renovated apartment with clean wood-grain flooring, fresh paint, and contemporary kitchen with glass backsplash, built-in gas cooktop, and oven. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling balcony doors. Baby safety concerns: balcony has glass/metal railings that would need childproofing, and the balcony sliding door would need a lock; otherwise no visible stairs or sharp corners. The unit appears unfurnished and very clean."}
