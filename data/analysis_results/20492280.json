{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment with hardwood floors and dated 1990s-2000s Taiwanese décor including decorative columns, stone accent walls, and ornate ceiling molding. The unit is clean and unfurnished with good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the low half-walls/partitions could be a concern as a climbing toddler might attempt to scale them; the open layout is generally baby-friendly but kitchen appears accessible without barriers."}
