{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, split AC units, and quality wood cabinetry. The space appears bright with tile flooring throughout and good storage. For baby safety, the enclosed balcony with washing machine area has window bars which is good, though the tile floors are hard surfaces. Being on the 1st floor eliminates stair/balcony fall risks but may have less natural light and potential security/noise concerns from street level."}
