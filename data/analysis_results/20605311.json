{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and light wood flooring. The unit has good natural light through large windows with city views from the 14th floor. For baby safety, the wooden furniture has some hard corners that may need padding, but there are no visible balcony concerns or stairs; the open floor plan is relatively safe for a crawling baby."}
