{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes, recessed lighting, built-in shelving, and wood flooring throughout. Very clean and bright with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the bar stools near the kitchen counter and open shelving could pose climbing hazards, but overall the space has rounded furniture edges and no visible stairs or concerning balcony access."}
