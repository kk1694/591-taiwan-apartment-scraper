{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment with high ceilings, contemporary fixtures, wood flooring, and sleek kitchen. Major baby safety concern: the open internal staircase has no railing or gate, posing a serious fall hazard for crawling babies and toddlers. Balcony railings appear to have adequate spacing but would need verification. Good natural light through floor-to-ceiling windows."}
