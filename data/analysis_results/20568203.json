{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated furnishings including worn leather sofas, old-style kitchen with gas stove and basic cabinets, and window-unit AC in bedrooms. The living area is spacious with tile flooring and reasonably clean, but the furniture and fixtures are clearly aging. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners, the kitchen has an open gas stove at accessible height, and at least one bedroom shown has only a single bed which would be too small for a couple; natural light appears limited with no windows visible in the living area."}
