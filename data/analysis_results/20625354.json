{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with clean finishes, light wood cabinetry, recessed lighting, and quality appliances including large refrigerator, washing machine, and split AC units. Good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery, and the pegboard wall hooks in the entryway may need childproofing; no visible balcony railings or stairs of concern. Overall very clean and move-in ready condition."}
