{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean studio apartment with white tile floors, built-in wardrobes, kitchenette with washing machine, and good natural light from large windows with balcony. For baby safety: the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass doors that should be secured, and the glass partition near the kitchen area could be a concern. The space is compact at ~33 sqm which may feel tight for a growing family, but it's well-maintained and in good condition."}
