{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylish loft-style apartment with exposed wooden beams and modern fixtures, good natural light from large windows and balcony. Major baby safety concern: there is an internal staircase with steep wooden steps leading to a mezzanine level, and the open shelving units have sharp corners. The glass coffee table also poses a risk. Overall clean and well-maintained with artistic design touches."}
