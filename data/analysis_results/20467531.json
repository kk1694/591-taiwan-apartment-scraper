{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including recessed lighting, split AC units, light wood laminate flooring, and a stylish green accent wall in the bedroom. The space includes a living area with sofa and wall-mounted TV, a dining area with 4-seat table, and a separate bedroom with double bed. For baby safety, the balcony has sliding glass doors (check railing height), and the open metal shelving unit has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing; the large bedroom window sill area is low and could be a climbing hazard. Natural light is moderate — windows face neighboring buildings closely, limiting direct sunlight. Being on the 5th floor of an 8-story building without confirmed elevator access is a concern with a stroller."}
