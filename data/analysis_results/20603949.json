{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older-style Taiwanese apartment (likely 1980s-90s) on the 3rd floor of a 4-story walkup building with parquet wood flooring throughout, dated light fixtures, and yellowed ceilings. The kitchen is functional but cluttered with older cabinets and appliances, and the rear balcony is narrow with exposed pipes, a gas water heater, and metal security grilles with gaps that pose a baby safety concern. Natural light appears limited in bedrooms; the glass coffee table with sharp corners in the living room and the balcony clutter are additional hazards for a crawling baby."}
