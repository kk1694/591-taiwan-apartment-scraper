{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Fugui 1st Road, Beitou District, near Mingde MRT Station", "notes": "Large 4-bedroom/2-bathroom apartment (57 ping) in an elevator building on Fugui 1st Road, very close to Mingde MRT (642m). Fully furnished with major appliances, cooking allowed with natural gas, pets permitted, and eligible for household registration — all positives for a settling family. The agent (Nicole Lin, Elegant Realty) appears to specialize in expat clients, which is helpful for a foreign couple. At NT$65,000 plus NT$5,000 management fee, it is mid-range for this size. The spacious layout with 4 rooms provides plenty of space for a nursery. However, condition/modernity cannot be confirmed without interior photos — request images to check for baby safety concerns such as balcony railing gaps, sharp corners, stair hazards, and window locks. Proximity to schools and medical facilities is a strong plus for a growing family."}
