{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and recently renovated apartment with clean light blue walls, modern wood-look laminate flooring, LED recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture including a large sofa and TV stand. The unit is on the top floor (4F/4F) of a walkup building with no elevator, which is a significant concern for a pregnant woman and later carrying a baby with stroller. For baby safety, the space is mostly open-plan with few sharp corners visible, windows have security grilles, and the glass partition doors between rooms may need child-proofing; the large open living area provides good play space but the dining table has sharp corners that would need edge guards."}
