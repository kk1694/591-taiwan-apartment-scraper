{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large, clean, unfurnished apartment in a modern high-rise (5F/24F, almost certainly with elevator). The unit features polished tile floors, wall-mounted AC units, a modern kitchen with gas stove, dish dryer, and refrigerator, plus a bathroom with bathtub. The enclosed rear balcony with gas water heater and washing machine has brick walls providing good safety, though the bathtub will need supervision with a baby. At 49.3 ping this is very spacious for a growing family, but the completely empty/unfurnished living rooms mean significant furniture costs upfront."}
