{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment (51 ping) with light wood laminate flooring, multiple rooms, AC units, and recessed lighting. The unit appears clean but dated with older-style fixtures, warm-toned lighting, and wooden trim from possibly the 2000s era. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is good, but the unit is completely empty so condition of kitchen/bathroom is unclear; windows appear to have security grilles which is positive, though some exposed wiring is visible on the living room floor. Natural light appears moderate from the windows visible in each room."}
