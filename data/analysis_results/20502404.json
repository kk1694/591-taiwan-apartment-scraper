{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large spacious apartment with traditional/classical style furniture including ornate wooden pieces and chandeliers - not modern aesthetics. Very clean with polished tile floors and good natural light from large windows. Baby safety concerns include sharp corners on heavy wooden furniture (dining table, coffee table, cabinets), hard tile floors throughout, and the glass-topped furniture. Being on 11F of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
