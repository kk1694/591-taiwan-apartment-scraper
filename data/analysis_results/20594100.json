{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean white walls, recessed lighting, stylish black-frame glass partitions, and a fully tiled modern bathroom with glass shower enclosure. The space appears to be a 1-bedroom layout with open living/kitchen area, looking very clean and well-maintained. For baby safety, the round coffee tables with metal edges and the glass partition doors could be concerns; the tile floors are slippery, and the bathroom glass shower door lacks child-proofing. Building is 14 floors so very likely has an elevator; natural light appears limited based on photos showing mostly artificial lighting."}
