{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated first-floor apartment with modern finishes, clean white walls, and wood-laminate flooring throughout. The unit has good natural light from large glass doors leading to a small outdoor area/garden. For baby safety, the low coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but the floor-to-ceiling glass sliding doors and outdoor access would need childproofing; no visible stairs inside which is positive for a first-floor unit."}
