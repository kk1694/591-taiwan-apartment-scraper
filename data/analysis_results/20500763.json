{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and a well-equipped kitchen with stainless steel appliances including built-in oven. The unit appears unfurnished with good natural light from large windows. Baby safety looks favorable - no visible balconies with accessible railings, floors are smooth without stairs, and corners appear standard. The building has a well-maintained courtyard with trees and is in a 20-story building which almost certainly has an elevator."}
