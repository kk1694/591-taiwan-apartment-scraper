{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with stylish furnishings, ceiling fan, AC, and modern kitchen with glossy cabinets. The large balcony has diamond-pattern metal railings which are reasonably baby-safe but the gap spacing should be verified. Floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light. Being on 5F/6F without visible elevator information, stairs may be challenging with a stroller."}
