{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, new-build apartment on the 16th floor of a 19-story building in Datong district with clean minimalist finishes, light wood paneling, large format tile flooring, recessed AC, and built-in cabinetry. The living room has a balcony with metal railings that appear adequately spaced but would need a baby gate; the flat single-level layout with no stairs is excellent for baby safety, though the low TV console has sharp corners worth padding. The apartment appears mostly unfurnished with good natural light from large windows, and the overall condition is excellent — however the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag suggesting limited detail about lease terms."}
