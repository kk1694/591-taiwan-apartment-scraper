{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and clean apartment in an 18-story building (6F) with sleek white cabinetry, recessed lighting, modern AC units, Toshiba refrigerator, and built-in kitchen with gas stove. The unit has at least 2 bedrooms plus a third room that could serve as a nursery, with good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows in every room. For baby safety, the tile floors are smooth and easy to clean but slippery, the coffee table in the living room has sharp corners, and the large windows with low sills may need childproofing; however the overall spacious layout (47 ping) and single-level design are very family-friendly."}
