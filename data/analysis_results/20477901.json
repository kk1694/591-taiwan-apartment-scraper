{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Mixed condition apartment with a renovated living room (modern furniture, fresh paint) but older kitchen and utility areas with dated fixtures and worn tile flooring. The bedroom has an older window AC unit rather than split system. For baby safety, the balcony area with laundry has metal security grilles which is good, but the kitchen has sharp counter corners and the step threshold between kitchen and laundry area could be a tripping hazard. Spacious 45 ping unit with decent natural light through barred windows."}
