{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylishly renovated loft-style apartment with industrial design featuring exposed concrete, quality hardwood floors, track lighting, and modern AC units. Very spacious at 49 ping with multiple rooms. Baby safety concerns include the open industrial aesthetic with exposed pipes/ducts, potentially sharp metal shelf edges, and large open spaces that may need baby-proofing. Natural light appears limited with small windows; overall very clean and well-maintained."}
