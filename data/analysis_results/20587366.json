{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is a multi-level unit (townhouse/duplex style) with interior stairs visible in the dining area, which is a significant safety concern for a family with a baby. The apartment has older-style wooden furniture and cabinetry with a somewhat dated aesthetic despite clean tile floors. Natural light appears limited in several rooms with small windows, and the stairs lack visible baby gates making this unsuitable for a crawling infant or toddler."}
