{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with stylish minimalist design, recessed lighting, concrete accent walls, and quality wood flooring. Open-plan living with kitchen island and bar stools. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light with garden views. For baby safety, the low window seat area and bar stools could be concerns; the kitchen island's open metal rack above is reachable by climbing children. Overall clean and spacious at 37 ping in desirable Da'an district."}
