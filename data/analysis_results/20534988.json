{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern apartment with updated finishes including glossy white kitchen cabinets, granite countertops, built-in TV niche, and ambient lighting. The space is well-maintained with smooth tile flooring and a compact but functional open kitchen with gas stove and dish dryer. For baby safety, the glass dining table has sharp corners that would need protection, and the open shelving with decorative items could be a hazard for a crawling child; no balcony or stairs visible, which is a plus. Being on 2F of a 7-floor older building, elevator availability is uncertain and the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag."}
