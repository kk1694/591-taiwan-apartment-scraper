{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Highly modern, beautifully renovated apartment with premium finishes including recessed lighting, crystal chandelier, open-plan living/kitchen with island counter, sleek white cabinetry, glass backsplash, and modern split AC. The space is very clean with smooth tile floors and no visible sharp corners or stairs, making it relatively baby-safe; however the balcony (image 5) has an open feel with tiled walls but low railing gaps should be verified in person. At 25 ping on the 5th floor of an 11-story building (very likely has elevator), this is a spacious, well-lit unit that appears move-in ready, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — confirm actual terms directly."}
