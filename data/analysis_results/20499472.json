The open floor plan has good natural light through large windows with floor-to-ceiling curtains. For baby safety, the space is single-level with no stairs, rounded corners on counters, and balcony access appears to have sliding doors that can be secured; tile floors are easy to clean but may need rugs for cushioning."}
