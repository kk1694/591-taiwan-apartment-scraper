{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end studio apartment with modern finishes, built-in cabinetry, and hotel-style furnishings. The space is very clean with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety: the balcony has low railings visible from the bathroom image which is a concern on the 8th floor; the glass coffee table has sharp corners; however there are no stairs and the layout is single-level. The studio layout (combined living/sleeping area) may feel cramped for a family of three."}
