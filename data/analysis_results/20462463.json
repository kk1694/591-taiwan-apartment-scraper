{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with light wood flooring, recessed lighting, and clean contemporary finishes. Excellent built-in storage including bookshelves and cabinets. Baby safety is good - no visible sharp corners, raised window sills with frosted glass, no dangerous balcony access visible. Natural light appears limited due to frosted windows but overall a bright, clean, and well-maintained space suitable for a young family."}
