{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "This is a large 43-ping unit on the 9th floor of a 19-floor building, which strongly suggests an elevator building. The listing description is minimal, containing only a promotional message for the agent's sales package rather than any actual property details. At NT$80,000/month for Shilin district, the price suggests a decent-quality apartment, but without images or a proper description, it is impossible to assess modernity, baby safety features, or condition. The lack of substantive listing content is a red flag — prospective tenants should request photos and a viewing before proceeding."}
