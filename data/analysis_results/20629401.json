{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Clean, modern apartment managed by UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly rental agency with Japanese text). Living room is spacious with recessed lighting, tiled floors, green sofa, and large curtained windows providing good natural light. Two bedrooms shown with new mattresses and built-in wardrobes. For baby safety, the apartment appears to be on a single level with no visible stairs, and corners on furniture are mostly rounded, though the dining table has sharp edges that would need corner guards. At 4F/5F with no elevator evidence visible, carrying a stroller up stairs could be a concern. The listing description is minimal (just a promo message), which is a minor red flag — ask the agent for full details on layout, bathroom count, and lease terms."}
