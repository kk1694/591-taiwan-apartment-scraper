{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Top floor (7F/7F) apartment with large rooftop terrace overlooking mountains in Shilin area. Interior shows modern laminate flooring, built-in wardrobe, and updated bathroom with contemporary vanity. The rooftop terrace has low walls which could be a safety concern for a crawling/walking baby - would need barriers. Clean condition overall but limited interior photos make it difficult to fully assess living spaces and natural light."}
