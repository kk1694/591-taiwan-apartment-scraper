Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows on multiple sides. For baby safety: the coffee table has sharp glass corners that would need padding, and the balcony access with sliding doors on 12th floor requires attention. The open-plan layout is spacious and clean with modern kitchen appliances including washer/dryer."}
