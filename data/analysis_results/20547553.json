{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated high-rise apartment (14F/27F) in excellent condition with premium finishes including Bosch built-in oven and microwave, sleek white cabinetry, polished porcelain tile floors, modern bathroom with glass shower enclosure and bidet toilet, and Dormakaba digital door lock. Very spacious at 51 ping with large windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the polished tile floors are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling/walking toddler; no balcony visible in photos which is actually a plus for child safety. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat-focused agency), unfurnished, and in pristine move-in condition."}
