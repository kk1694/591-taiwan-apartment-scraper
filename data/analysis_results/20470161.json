{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with designer finishes including recessed lighting, stylish chandelier, large TV, and quality built-in wardrobes. Very clean with at least 2 bedrooms plus en-suite bathroom. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. The coffee tables have irregular edges that could pose bump hazards for a crawling baby; windows have security bars which is positive for child safety. Overall excellent condition, well-suited for a family."}
