{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with pristine white tile floors, recessed LED lighting, split AC units, and modern dark wood doors throughout. The unit appears to be a 2-3 bedroom layout on the 10th floor of a 16-story building with a balcony featuring proper metal railings visible in the last image; the balcony sliding door is floor-to-ceiling glass which would need a baby gate, and the slippery polished tile floors are a concern for a crawling baby. The apartment is very clean and bright with good natural light from the balcony, and the high floor with mountain views is a plus, though the completely unfurnished state means significant setup cost."}
