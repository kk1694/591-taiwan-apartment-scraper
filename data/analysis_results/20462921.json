{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed lighting, wood-grain flooring, new L-shaped sofa, wall-mounted TV, washing machine, and large refrigerator. The spacious living area has rounded coffee table edges and no visible sharp corners, which is good for baby safety; however, at 2F with no elevator confirmed, carrying a stroller up stairs could be inconvenient. Natural light appears limited in most photos but image 4 shows a decent window with sheer curtains; the description is minimal (agent listing placeholder) which is a minor red flag — worth visiting to verify full layout and check for bedrooms, kitchen, and bathroom conditions not shown."}
