{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment in excellent condition with LED lighting, split AC units, modern kitchen with built-in oven and dishwasher. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety: the balcony has sliding glass doors that can be locked, but the floor tiles are very smooth/slippery which could be a concern for a crawling baby; no visible sharp corners on furniture. Clean, move-in ready condition with digital door lock."}
