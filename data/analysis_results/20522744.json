{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 39-ping apartment in Songshan with hardwood floors, recessed lighting with cove lighting, and multiple rooms including at least two bedrooms. The furniture and finishes are dated (traditional dark wood bed frames, older-style sofas, marble coffee table) suggesting a well-maintained but older renovation from perhaps 10-15 years ago. Being on the top floor (7F/7F) raises concerns about heat and potential roof leaks; the second bedroom has sloped ceilings typical of a top-floor unit. Windows have security grilles which are good for baby safety, but the marble coffee table corners in the living room would need padding. Natural light appears moderate through barred windows. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — request a proper viewing to assess kitchen, bathroom, and overall building condition."}
