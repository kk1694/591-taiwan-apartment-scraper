{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated open-plan unit with track lighting, laminate flooring, open kitchen island with gas stove, and glass-partitioned bathroom. The space feels more like a converted commercial/loft unit than a traditional apartment — the exposed ceiling pipes, industrial lighting, and very open layout with minimal room divisions raise questions about whether this is a proper residential flat. For baby safety, the glass bathroom partitions have hard edges at floor level, and the open kitchen with gas stove lacks barriers; the bedroom appears small and separated only by a doorway. Natural light seems limited as curtains cover what appear to be the only windows."}
