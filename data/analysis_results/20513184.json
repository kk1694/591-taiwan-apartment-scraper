{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained duplex unit with elegant finishes including crystal chandelier, marble TV wall, recessed lighting, and quality wood-grain flooring. Major baby safety concern: the unit has internal stairs leading to a second level which poses a significant fall hazard for crawling babies/toddlers and would require gates. There's also a small balcony visible. The glass coffee table has sharp corners. Good natural light from the balcony area, and the space appears clean and well-kept."}
