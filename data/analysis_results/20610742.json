{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a duplex/loft apartment with an open spiral staircase that poses significant safety concerns for a baby - no handrails on lower steps and wide gaps between treads. The apartment appears dated (older style fixtures, stone accent wall, traditional chandelier) but is clean and in reasonable condition. Natural light is limited to one balcony window; the loft bedroom has low ceiling height and no windows visible."}
