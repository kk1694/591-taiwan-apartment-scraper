{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in pristine condition with high-end finishes including marble accent wall, crystal chandelier, recessed lighting, glossy polished tile floors, and a fully equipped modern kitchen with gas stove, range hood, dishwasher, and ample counter space. The balcony has proper railings visible through large sliding glass doors, though the smooth tile floors could be slippery for a crawling baby and the sharp-cornered coffee table and open kitchen island may need baby-proofing. Very spacious at ~49 ping with abundant natural light from multiple large windows, and the overall cleanliness and condition are top-notch — a strong option for a family."}
