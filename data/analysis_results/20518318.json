{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious older-style apartment with ornate ceiling moldings and classic decor. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with good natural light from large windows, but has an outdated aesthetic (wall-mounted AC units, dated furniture, classical ceiling fixtures). For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners and the glass display cabinets in multiple rooms are concerns; the elevated platform bed area in one room could also pose a fall risk for a crawling baby."}
