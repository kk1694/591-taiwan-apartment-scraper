{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with quality built-in wood cabinetry, recessed lighting, and clean tile floors. The space includes a raised tatami-style room which could pose a minor trip hazard for toddlers. Glass display shelving and coffee table have sharp corners that would need baby-proofing. The balcony has proper metal railings but access should be monitored. Good natural light through multiple windows, overall very clean condition."}
