{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment in a modern high-rise building (2F/14F) with clean polished tile floors, white walls, AC units, a galley kitchen with gas stove and dish dryer, and a bathroom with bathtub. The balcony has glass panel railings which are a baby safety concern as a toddler could potentially climb on the lower brick ledge; the bathtub also needs supervision. Good natural light from windows in bedrooms and balcony. The unit appears clean and well-maintained but completely empty, so all furniture would need to be provided. Construction site visible nearby from balcony may mean noise during daytime."}
