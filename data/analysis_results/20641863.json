{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a duplex/loft-style apartment with an open spiral staircase leading to an upper sleeping loft - a significant safety hazard for a baby or toddler as the stairs have no risers and minimal railing protection. The apartment appears clean but dated with older stone accent walls and fixtures. Natural light is limited to one balcony window; the loft bedroom has no windows and low ceiling height."}
