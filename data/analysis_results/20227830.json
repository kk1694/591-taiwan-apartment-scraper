{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment in good condition with clean white walls, polished tile floors, and contemporary furnishings. The unit is spacious at 50 ping with an open floor plan connecting living and dining areas to a semi-open kitchen. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, but overall the flat surfaces and no visible stairs are positive. Natural light appears limited with only one visible window, but the building appears to be a well-maintained newer construction."}
