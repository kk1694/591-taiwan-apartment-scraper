{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment with new fixtures including split AC units, contemporary wood-grain laminate flooring, and a compact but modern kitchen with induction cooktop. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling balcony doors. For baby safety: the balcony access is a consideration but has standard railings visible; no sharp corners evident, and clean smooth surfaces throughout. The bathroom has a glass shower partition that would need supervision with a toddler."}
