{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and clean apartment with contemporary finishes, recessed LED lighting, built-in cabinetry, and high-end appliances including a large stainless steel refrigerator and front-loading washer. For baby safety, the space appears single-level with no visible stairs, and furniture has mostly rounded edges; however, low windows and the raised platform bed area may need childproofing. Natural light appears limited based on the nighttime photos showing small windows, but the unit is well-lit artificially."}
