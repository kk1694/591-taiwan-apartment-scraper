{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "The apartment is in fair condition with mixed-era finishes — one bathroom has been updated with a modern vanity and bidet toilet while the other retains an older bathtub and basic fixtures. The bedroom has built-in closets and AC but wallpaper and tile floors feel dated. For baby safety, the windows have security grilles which is good, but the bathtub bathroom lacks a shower partition, and the hard tile floors throughout could be slippery; limited photos make it hard to assess balconies or living areas. At 37.4 ping in Da'an on 2F of a 17-floor building it is spacious, but the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — request more photos and details before visiting."}
