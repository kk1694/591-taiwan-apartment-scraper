{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, newly renovated apartment with modern furniture, recessed lighting, and split AC units in multiple rooms. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light. Good for baby safety - no visible balcony access from interior, rounded furniture edges on coffee table, and single-level layout with no stairs. The windows have secure frames that appear child-safe."}
