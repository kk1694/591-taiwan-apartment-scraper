{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and clean studio apartment with brand-new fixtures, light wood furniture, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, front-loading washer, fridge, microwave, kitchenette with sink, and a modern bathroom with glass door. The space is compact at ~39 sqm with an open-plan layout—adequate for a couple but tight once a baby arrives with crib and gear. No balcony visible and windows have solid half-walls, which is good for baby safety; no stairs or sharp corners observed, and the pegboard wall hooks may need to be baby-proofed later. Good natural light from large windows on the 6th floor."}
