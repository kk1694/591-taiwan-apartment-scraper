{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District, near a riverside walking path (possibly Shuangxi or Waishuangxi creek area)", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment in a high-rise building (11 floors) with elegant lobby entrance and recessed lighting. The living room features updated fixtures, built-in cabinetry, warm LED lighting, and clean wood-tone flooring — very clean and move-in ready. The balcony has glass-panel railings with metal frames at a reasonable height, but the glass lower portion and horizontal bars could be a concern for a climbing toddler — baby-proofing the balcony access would be essential. The neighborhood appears pleasant with a riverside walking path and greenery nearby, good for stroller walks."}
