{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and stylish apartment with contemporary fixtures, recessed lighting, central AC, and clean minimalist design. The unit appears well-maintained with quality finishes including a modern kitchen with full appliances and glass sliding doors separating the bedroom. For baby safety, the windows have security bars which is good, but the glass sliding door to the bedroom and floating shelves with books could be concerns as a child grows. Good natural light in bedroom; appears to be a short-term rental setup based on the 'Welcome to Taipei' sign."}
