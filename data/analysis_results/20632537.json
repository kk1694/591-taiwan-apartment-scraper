{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with clean wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, and contemporary built-in cabinetry. The unit has two bedrooms (one master, one smaller room suitable as a nursery) plus a galley kitchen. Baby safety concerns include no visible balcony railings but some sharp furniture corners; the space appears clean with minimal hazards. Natural light is limited due to small windows but artificial lighting is good."}
