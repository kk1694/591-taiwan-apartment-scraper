{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older apartment with dated fixtures, drop ceilings, and furniture from the 1990s-2000s era. The unit has multiple bedrooms including a master bedroom with en-suite bathroom, making it spacious for a family. For baby safety, the glass-door cabinets could be a hazard, and the small windows suggest limited natural light; no visible balcony concerns but the older construction and exposed tile bathroom threshold may need attention."}
