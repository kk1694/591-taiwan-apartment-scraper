{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "Well-furnished apartment with central AC, modern kitchen with gas stove and appliances, but has a split-level layout with raised platform area which poses a safety concern for a crawling baby. Glass shelving and some sharp corners on cabinetry would need baby-proofing. Clean condition with good artificial lighting, though natural light appears limited based on the curtained windows."}
