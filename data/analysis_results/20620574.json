{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is clearly a commercial/office space, not a residential apartment. It features fluorescent grid ceiling lights, a reception counter, large glass partitions, whiteboards, no-smoking signs, and a conference-style glass table — all typical of an office or storefront on the ground floor. The walls show signs of wear with peeling paint and water stains, and the space is mostly unfurnished. Completely unsuitable for a couple with a baby — no kitchen, no bathroom visible, no residential features, and being on 1F it opens directly to the street with no secure entry."}
