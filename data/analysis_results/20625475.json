{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Large 60-ping unfurnished apartment with a dated aesthetic — the living area features an ornate recessed ceiling with chandelier and Japanese-style shoji screen dividers, giving it a 1990s/2000s feel rather than modern. Bedrooms have clean light wood flooring and AC units, and the balcony has metal railings with adequate spacing but would need a baby gate or barrier for safety. The unit is very spacious and clean with decent natural light through windows, but the slippery polished tile floors in the main living area and the raised platform step between rooms are potential hazards for a crawling baby or toddler."}
