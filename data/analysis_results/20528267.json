{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and modern apartment in very clean condition with built-in wooden cabinetry, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC units, and polished tile floors throughout. At least two bedrooms visible — master with large built-in wardrobe and a second bedroom with en-suite bathroom and shelving. Windows have metal security grilles which are good for baby safety, and the flat layout with no stairs is ideal for a young family. The unit appears unfurnished in the living area, giving flexibility for baby-proofing. Natural light is decent. At 9F/14F in Neihu, the building almost certainly has an elevator. The listing description is minimal (just a generic agent promo), which is a minor red flag — ask for more details on layout, balcony access, and lease terms."}
