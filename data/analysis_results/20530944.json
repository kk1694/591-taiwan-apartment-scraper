{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Upscale, well-maintained apartment with hardwood floors, modern kitchen with gas stove and built-in appliances, and elegant furnishings. The living area has floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access that would need child safety gates; the glass coffee table has sharp corners requiring padding. Excellent natural light and very clean condition overall; no visible stairs but the balcony sliding doors are a concern for baby safety."}
