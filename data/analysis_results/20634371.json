{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment in Da'an with recessed lighting, split AC units, and polished tile/wood floors. The living room has a sliding glass balcony door with decent railings but the balcony access and slippery tile floors are baby safety concerns. The unit appears to be a 2-bedroom with an additional loft/mezzanine area (image 5 shows open shelving stairs without railings, which is a significant hazard for a crawling baby); natural light is moderate with windows in bedrooms and the living area balcony. At 22.81 ping the size is reasonable for a couple with a baby, but the listed price of NT$50,000 and the minimal description (agent placeholder text only) are red flags suggesting this may be a bait listing."}
