{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with white tile floors, recessed lighting, split AC, and an open-plan living area with kitchen. The space is bright with decent natural light (shown in the 'lights off' photo). Baby safety concerns include a large mirrored glass wall that could shatter, a glass TV stand with sharp edges, an open staircase/shelving unit, and bar-height glass stools near the kitchen; the hard tile floors would also benefit from area rugs. Overall the unit is in good condition and well-maintained, but the heavy use of glass and mirrors warrants childproofing."}
