{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern unfurnished apartment with glossy white tile floors, ceiling fans with lights, split AC, and large windows with curtains in every room. The building appears relatively new with a contemporary design. Balcony railings visible through windows appear to have narrow-spaced bars which is good for baby safety, and windows have security grilles; however, the unit is on the 9th floor of a 14-floor building so balcony access should be secured with child locks once the baby is mobile. Natural light appears moderate as the unit faces other buildings at close range. One bedroom has a large traditional wooden wardrobe which adds storage but has hard corners to be mindful of with a crawling baby."}
