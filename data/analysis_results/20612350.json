{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylish, heavily renovated apartment with crystal chandeliers, mirrored walls, marble-look surfaces, and a modern kitchen with gas stove. The unit appears to be a duplex/loft with a mezzanine level (image 4 shows a low-ceiling upper level with dark hardwood flooring and glass railing), which is a significant baby safety concern due to the open glass balustrade and the stairs required to access it. The extensive use of glass panels, mirrored surfaces, and sharp-edged bar stools also pose risks for a crawling baby; natural light appears limited on the main level but better on the upper floor. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent) in Da'an district, the unit is clean and well-maintained but the flashy hotel-like decor and loft layout may not be practical for a family with an infant."}
