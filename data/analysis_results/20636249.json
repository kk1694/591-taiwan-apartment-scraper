{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including patterned ceiling tiles, fluorescent lighting, and 1990s-style kitchen cabinets. Walls show signs of wear with tape residue and discoloration. The spacious unfurnished layout has multiple rooms with built-in closets and window security grilles. Windows appear small, limiting natural light. For baby safety, the tile floors are easy to clean but hard if falling; no visible balcony hazards but would need outlet covers and corner protectors."}
