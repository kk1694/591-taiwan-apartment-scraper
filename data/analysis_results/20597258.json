{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-maintained, upscale apartment on the 19th floor with European-style interior finishes, recessed ceiling lighting, open kitchen with island counter, and a separate laundry area. The bedroom has large windows with excellent natural light and panoramic city views. For baby safety, the windows appear to have adequate height but the balcony access doors in the living room should be secured; the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the open kitchen layout means the gas stove area would need a gate or barrier once the baby is mobile."}
