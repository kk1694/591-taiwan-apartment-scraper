{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, well-maintained apartment with modern furnishings including a contemporary sofa, dining set, and light wood flooring. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing. The balcony areas have metal security grilles which provide safety, though the narrow service balcony with exposed pipes and electrical box is a concern for children. Good natural light from windows and balcony doors."}
