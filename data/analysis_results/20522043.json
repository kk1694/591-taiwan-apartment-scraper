{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Guling Street, Zhongzheng District, near Guting MRT Station", "notes": "Spacious 3BR/2BA newly renovated apartment (55 ping) on 5F of a 14-floor elevator building near Guting MRT. Well-furnished with AC, fridge, washer, and two balconies providing good natural light. For a couple with a baby: the two balconies need railing inspection for child safety, the no-pets policy suggests a quieter building, and the proximity to MRT, schools, and shops is very convenient. Note the additional NT$9,000/month management fee bringing total cost to ~NT$89,000. Overall a solid, family-friendly option in a prime Zhongzheng location."}
