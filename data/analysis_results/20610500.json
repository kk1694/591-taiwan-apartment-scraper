{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with European-style decor, recessed LED lighting, and polished tile floors. The kitchen has updated appliances including gas cooktop and range hood with glass backsplash. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners is a concern, but the spacious open layout is good; no balcony visible in photos. The apartment is very clean with good condition overall."}
