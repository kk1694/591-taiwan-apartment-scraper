{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious apartment with dated but well-maintained fixtures from around 2000s era. Features hardwood parquet flooring throughout, ceiling-mounted AC, and built-in storage. The unit is clean with good natural light, though the décor style is traditional/dated. For baby safety: the low coffee table and Japanese-style sliding door room could work well for a nursery, but the sharp-cornered furniture would need baby-proofing."}
