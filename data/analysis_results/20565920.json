{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-renovated studio apartment in very clean condition with recessed LED lighting, wood-tone laminate flooring, built-in cabinetry, wall-mounted AC, flat-screen TV, kitchenette with induction cooktop, microwave, fridge, and washing machine. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with sheer curtains. Being on the top floor (6F/6F) with no elevator info is a concern for carrying a stroller and baby; the open-plan studio layout has no stairs or sharp corners, making it relatively baby-safe, but at 17 ping it may feel tight for a growing family."}
