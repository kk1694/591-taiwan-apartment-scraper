{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with wood-grain flooring, built-in LED lighting, wall-mounted TV, and sleek kitchen with modern appliances. Clean open layout with minimal sharp corners, though the floor-to-ceiling windows in bedroom area may need child safety locks. Building appears to be a newer high-rise (6F/15F suggests elevator). Good natural light through large windows with blinds."}
