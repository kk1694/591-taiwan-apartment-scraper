{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern studio-style apartment with polished tile floors, recessed ceiling lighting, AC, and a compact kitchenette with gas stove, washing machine, microwave, and dish rack. The space appears well-maintained but quite small for a couple with a baby; the kitchenette is open to the living area with no separation, and the low coffee table and slippery tile floors could be concerns for a crawling baby. No balcony or windows are clearly visible in the photos, raising concerns about natural light and ventilation."}
