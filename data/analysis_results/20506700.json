{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei 101, Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with excellent natural light and views of Taipei 101. Very clean condition with recessed lighting, open kitchen island, AC units, and polished tile/wood flooring. For baby safety: no visible balconies in photos which is good, all windows appear to have low sills that will need guards, and the floor-to-ceiling open layout has no obvious hazards but the hard tile floors may need area rugs for a crawling infant."}
