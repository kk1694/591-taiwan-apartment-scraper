{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "Spacious, well-appointed modern apartment on 16F of a 27-story high-rise with upscale finishes including marble dining table, crystal chandelier, built-in cabinetry, recessed AC, and a fully equipped galley kitchen with Hitachi fridge and gas stove. The unit is very clean with large windows providing excellent natural light and city views. For baby safety, the balcony railing height appears adequate but the large floor-to-ceiling windows and hard tile/wood flooring throughout should be noted; the marble table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the open shelving in the living room is within reach of a crawling child."}
