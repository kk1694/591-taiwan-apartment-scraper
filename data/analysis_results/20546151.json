{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with brand new marble-look tile flooring, modern kitchen with new cabinetry and gas stove, and a stylish bathroom with gray stone-look tiles and modern toilet. At 7F/15F in a 15-story building, an elevator is very likely. The unit appears freshly completed with some items still in packaging; the open layout with smooth tile floors is baby-friendly with no stairs, though the lack of visible balcony railings in photos means the balcony safety should be verified in person. The listing description is minimal (mostly an agent ad), so specific amenities and lease terms would need to be confirmed directly."}
