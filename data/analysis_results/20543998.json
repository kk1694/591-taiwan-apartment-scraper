{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with minimalist Scandinavian-style furnishings, wood laminate flooring, recessed lighting, and split AC units. The space appears very clean with good natural light from the balcony. For baby safety, the balcony railing visible through glass doors should be checked for adequate height and gap spacing; furniture has relatively rounded edges but the coffee table corners may need padding."}
