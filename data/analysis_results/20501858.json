{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious, modern unfurnished apartment with clean white polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and multiple split AC units. The space is in excellent condition with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the open floor plan and lack of stairs are positive, though the hard tile floors may need rugs and outlet covers should be added to the exposed electrical outlets visible near floor level."}
