{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment (46.4 ping) with dated traditional Taiwanese cabinetry and built-in wooden furniture from the 2000s era. Tile floors are clean and the living area is large, but the balcony/utility areas look worn with exposed pipes and a corrugated metal roof addition. The balcony has half-height tile walls with sliding windows which would need baby-proofing; the rear utility/laundry area appears to be an enclosed rooftop addition with industrial feel. Natural light seems limited with only one window wall in the main living room. Red flag: listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), suggesting minimal transparency, and the price of NT$58,000 seems high for an older unfurnished unit in Datong District."}
