{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated apartment with modern minimalist design, featuring light wood flooring, new AC unit, large sectional sofa, and a spacious study/bedroom area with built-in storage. The bathroom has mixed modern and traditional elements. Good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the floors are flat with no stairs visible, but the furniture corners are relatively rounded. Being on 10F of a 14F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
