{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern duplex/loft-style apartment with clean white aesthetics, excellent natural light from large balcony doors, and stylish contemporary furniture. Major baby safety concern: the upper loft level has a glass railing with a significant drop to the living area below, and the internal staircase lacks a safety gate. The balcony also has railings that would need childproofing. Overall very clean and well-maintained but requires baby-proofing modifications."}
