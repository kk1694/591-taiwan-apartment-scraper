{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment with stylish wood-accented interior design, sleek white kitchen cabinetry with dark countertops, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing excellent natural light and lush green views. The space appears clean and well-maintained, managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency). For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows/sliding doors on the 3rd floor are a concern and would need child locks or guards; the coffee table has sharp corners that should be padded. The open layout with wood flooring is generally baby-friendly, though the space at ~20 ping may feel compact for a growing family."}
