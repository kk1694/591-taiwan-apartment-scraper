{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-designed modern apartment with stylish interior, quality furniture, and modern kitchen appliances. Good natural light from large windows. The balcony has a low brick wall railing without additional safety barriers, which is a significant concern for a baby - would need childproofing. No stairs visible. The building appears to be an older walk-up (3F/4F) in a typical Taipei residential neighborhood."}
