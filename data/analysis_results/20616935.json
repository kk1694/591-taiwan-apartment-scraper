{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes throughout — digital door lock, clean white/wood-tone cabinetry, modern bathroom with glass shower partition, and a well-equipped galley kitchen with gas stove and range hood. The unit appears unfurnished with at least two rooms plus kitchen and bathroom, offering good natural light from large black-frame windows. For baby safety, the tile floors are smooth and easy to clean, no visible balcony access or dangerous railings, and the windows appear secure; however the narrow galley kitchen and glass shower door may need child-proofing. Being on the 4th floor of a 9-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Very clean and move-in ready."}
