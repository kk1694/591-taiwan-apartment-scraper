{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older, unfurnished first-floor apartment in poor condition with heavily stained/damaged walls, exposed wiring, and dated fixtures. The space appears to have been previously used as an office (blue partition walls visible). For a family with a baby, concerns include exposed electrical wires on the floor, the need for significant renovation, and limited natural light from barred windows. The entrance opens directly to a covered parking/driveway area which may pose security and air quality concerns."}
