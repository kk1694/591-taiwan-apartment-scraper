{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with recessed lighting, clean white walls, marble-look coffee table, open kitchen with glass backsplash, and built-in storage throughout. The entryway has a video intercom and security door suggesting a managed building. The bedroom features a raised tatami-style platform bed with storage underneath and good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the raised platform in the bedroom could be a fall hazard for a crawling infant; the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. The apartment is very clean with good natural light and AC in multiple rooms, and the 7th floor of a 12-story building almost certainly has an elevator. The listing description is minimal (just a promotional ad for the agent platform), which is a minor red flag — request more details about layout and lease terms directly."}
