{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Spacious, well-renovated apartment with modern finishes including recessed LED lighting, glossy tile floors, ceiling-mounted projector, and quality wood-panel TV wall. The living area is very large and clean with good natural light from full-height sliding glass doors leading to a balcony. The balcony has metal railings that appear at a reasonable height but have gaps that could be a concern for a crawling toddler; the polished tile floors are also very slippery which is a baby safety consideration. The entryway has a digital door lock and intercom suggesting a well-maintained building, though elevator status is unclear from images alone."}
