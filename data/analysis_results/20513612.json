{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment with clean white walls, light wood laminate flooring, and new fixtures including AC units and a modern kitchen. Major baby safety concern: open internal staircase without any railing or gate - would require baby gates at both ends. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with balconies. The balconies have metal railings which appear adequate but would need inspection."}
