{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, built-in wardrobes, glass dining table, and polished tile floors throughout. At 42 ping it is spacious with at least 2 bedrooms; the living room has floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access that would need child-proofing, and the glass coffee table and dining table with sharp corners are baby safety concerns. The building is a 13-floor modern high-rise (4F) almost certainly with elevator, and the unit has good natural light, clean finishes, and no visible red flags — though the listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only)."}
