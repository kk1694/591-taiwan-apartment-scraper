{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near park with ferris wheel (Shilin area)", "notes": "Newly renovated high-floor apartment with excellent condition. Features marble-pattern tile floors, recessed lighting, modern bathroom with glass shower partition, and galley kitchen with gas stove. Large windows provide good natural light and park views. The unit is unfurnished with clean open layout. For baby safety, the balcony visible through the kitchen door and floor-to-ceiling living room windows would need childproofing; glass shower door in bathroom also requires attention. Overall very clean and move-in ready."}
