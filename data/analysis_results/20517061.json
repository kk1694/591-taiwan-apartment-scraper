No images or substantive description are available to assess modernity, elevator access, baby safety concerns, or natural light. At 17 ping (56.1 sqm) on the 6th floor of a 14-story building for NT$59,999/month in Zhongshan District, this appears to be a mid-rise residential unit, but further investigation is needed before considering it for a family with a baby."}
