{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, light wood flooring, and contemporary furniture. Excellent natural light from large windows. The unit appears baby-friendly with rounded furniture, no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings, and a flat open layout. However, this appears to be a duplex/loft style with an upper level visible in image 3-4, which could pose stair safety concerns for a crawling baby."}
