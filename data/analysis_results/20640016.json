{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a ground-floor commercial/storefront space (not a residential apartment), with a wide roll-up garage-style opening to the street. The property is in extremely poor, dilapidated condition with peeling walls, crumbling plaster, severe mold/water damage in the bathroom, exposed wiring, and a corrugated metal roof over the rear wet areas. Completely unsuitable for a couple expecting a baby due to severe hygiene concerns (mold, filthy toilet), structural decay, lack of proper kitchen or living amenities, and numerous safety hazards including uneven flooring and debris."}
