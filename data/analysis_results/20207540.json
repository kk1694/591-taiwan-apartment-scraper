{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with recessed LED lighting, polished tile and hardwood floors, updated kitchen with white cabinetry and modern appliances. At least 3 bedrooms plus a spacious living room with balcony access — very generous at 45 ping. The living room has smooth tile floors which are slippery for crawling babies; the balcony has sliding glass doors that need child locks. Windows in bedrooms have decorative iron grilles which are good for safety. The kitchen is galley-style with a back service door — knives and gas stove would need baby-proofing. Overall clean, bright, and in excellent condition with good natural light; a strong option for a family at this price point in Shilin."}
