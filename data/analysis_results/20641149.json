{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylishly renovated apartment with open-plan living featuring a kitchen island/bar counter, recessed and track lighting, concrete accent wall, and light wood flooring throughout. The space is spacious at 37 ping with large floor-to-ceiling windows providing greenery views, though being on 2F means natural light is partially blocked by surrounding trees. For baby safety, the glass display cabinet and bar stools with no backs are concerns, and the sharp-cornered coffee table and kitchen island would need padding; the open layout is otherwise good for supervision."}
