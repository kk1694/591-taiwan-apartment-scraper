{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Spacious, modern apartment (33 ping) on a high floor (11F/12F) with clean light wood flooring, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, split AC units, and a well-equipped L-shaped kitchen with gas stove and range hood. The unit is unfurnished and in excellent condition with large windows providing good natural light. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), the flat layout with no visible stairs is baby-safe, though the large windows on a high floor would need childproofing; the description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request a viewing to confirm full layout and bathroom condition."}
