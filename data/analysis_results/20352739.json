{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed LED lighting, central AC, built-in wardrobes, washer/dryer, and TV. Being on the 16th floor of a 21-story building strongly indicates elevator access. For baby safety: no visible balcony, no stairs, and furniture has rounded corners which is positive; however the small size (12.68 ping) may feel cramped for a family with a baby and all their gear."}
