{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang, Caster building", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment on the 22nd floor of a luxury high-rise with grand lobby entrance. Interior is very clean with wood-tone flooring, white walls, recessed lighting, modern sofa, large TV, and a well-equipped kitchen featuring Bosch built-in appliances (oven and microwave). Large bedroom windows offer panoramic city views with Taipei 101 visible. For baby safety: no visible balcony access (windows appear fixed or secured), flat single-level layout with no stairs, and rounded furniture edges on the coffee table—all positive. The unit appears move-in ready and in pristine condition with good natural light."}
