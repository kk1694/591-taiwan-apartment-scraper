{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "High-end modern apartment with designer finishes including herringbone dark wood flooring, recessed lighting, large open-plan dining/kitchen area, two bedrooms with upholstered headboards, and a luxury bathroom with freestanding soaking tub and dual vessel sinks. For baby safety, the bedroom in image 3 appears to have a glass partition separating it from the living area which could be hazardous, the dark flooring is hard surface, and the bathroom has slippery dark tile floors with an open bathtub requiring vigilance. Natural light appears moderate with floor-to-ceiling windows behind sheer curtains; the unit is on 4F of an 11-story building suggesting elevator access. Very clean and well-maintained, but the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag regarding transparency."}
