{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with new light wood flooring, fresh white paint, modern LED ceiling lights, and split AC units in multiple rooms. Very clean condition with a minimalist unfurnished layout. The balcony has proper railings visible through sliding glass doors, and windows have security grilles which add safety. Being on 5F/5F (top floor) with no elevator information is a concern for carrying a baby and stroller up stairs."}
