{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Well-maintained, upscale apartment with modern fixtures including a Hitachi multi-door fridge, built-in kitchen with gas stove and dishwasher, modern bidet toilet with bathtub, and elegant living room with chandelier and sculpted ceiling. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), indicating foreigner-friendly. For baby safety: the raised tatami-style platform bed in the second bedroom has hard edges that would need padding, and the bathtub lacks a grab bar; the living room has smooth light wood flooring which is good for crawling. Spacious at 40 ping with good natural light from multiple windows, very clean condition overall — a strong option for a family with a baby in a prime Da'an location."}
