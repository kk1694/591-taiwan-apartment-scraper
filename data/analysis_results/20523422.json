{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be an unfinished commercial/industrial space on the ground floor of a modern high-rise building, not a residential apartment. The interior shows bare concrete floors, exposed ceilings, unfinished walls with visible water damage and staining, and a very basic bathroom with dirty tiles. The kitchen area is rudimentary with just a sink cutout. Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby due to the raw unfinished condition, poor hygiene, minimal natural light, and lack of residential fixtures."}
