{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, marble-look accent walls, light wood flooring, and two modern bathrooms with glass shower partitions and Japanese-style smart toilets. Major baby safety concern: the bedroom has a loft/mezzanine area with open stairs and a minimal metal railing that would be dangerous for a crawling or toddling child. The glass shower partitions and bathroom grab bars are nice but the loft stairs are a significant hazard. Natural light appears limited based on the small windows visible, but the interior is very clean and well-maintained."}
