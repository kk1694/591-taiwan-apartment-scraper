{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be an old, semi-renovated commercial or warehouse-style space rather than a standard residential apartment. The property shows significant wear with peeling walls, exposed concrete, mismatched flooring (patterned tiles, stone, and wood), and an industrial aesthetic. Major baby safety concerns include an internal staircase with no visible railings or gates, exposed wiring, an open mezzanine/loft area with metal railings, and hard stone/concrete floors throughout. The space lacks natural light in most areas and has a cluttered, unfinished appearance that would require substantial work to make suitable for a family."}
