{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and clean apartment with contemporary white/cream furnishings, built-in cabinets, and good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. The unit has a balcony accessible from both living room and bedroom which would need baby-proofing. Glass shelving in kitchen area and sharp-cornered coffee table are potential safety concerns for a crawling baby. Overall excellent condition with no visible red flags."}
