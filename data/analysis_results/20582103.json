{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Nicely renovated apartment with modern Scandinavian-style furniture, wood-tone laminate flooring, and clean white walls throughout the living and dining areas. The kitchen is older and unrenovated with basic gas stove, range hood, and water heater showing some wear. For baby safety, the space is mostly open-plan with rounded furniture edges which is good, but the window with sliding glass doors has a window-unit AC and older-style iron grille balcony that should be checked; being on the 3rd floor of a 4-floor walkup means no elevator, which is inconvenient with a stroller. Natural light appears moderate based on the windows visible."}
