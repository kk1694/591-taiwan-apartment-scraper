{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with recessed lighting, light wood-tone flooring, and a sleek all-white kitchen with gas stove, range hood, and ample counter space. The living area is spacious and clean with a large sofa and dining table for six; the flat layout with no visible stairs is baby-friendly, though the dining table has sharp marble-look corners that would need edge guards. Listed via UR HOUSE (a foreign-focused rental agency) at 43 ping in Da'an on 6F/12F, the building very likely has an elevator; natural light appears moderate from a rear window, but only 5 photos were provided and no bedrooms or bathrooms are shown, which is a minor red flag for a 100K/month unit."}
