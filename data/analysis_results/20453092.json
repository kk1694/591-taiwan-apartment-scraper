{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and clean modern apartment with polished tile floors, wall-mounted AC, leather sofa, dining set, and a video intercom security system at the entrance. The 7th floor unit in a 15-story building appears well-maintained with good natural light from large windows; the flat layout with no visible stairs and smooth tile flooring is generally baby-friendly, though the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. The listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag — an in-person visit is strongly recommended to assess the full layout, kitchen, bathrooms, and any balcony safety."}
