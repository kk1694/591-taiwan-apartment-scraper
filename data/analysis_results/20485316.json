{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, modern light wood-look flooring, and recessed/decorative lighting throughout. Multiple AC units in each room indicate climate control. For baby safety: the living room has large sliding glass doors to a balcony (railing visibility unclear), glass coffee table with sharp corners would need baby-proofing, and the glass block window presents no hazard. Overall very clean and well-maintained with good natural light potential behind the curtains."}
