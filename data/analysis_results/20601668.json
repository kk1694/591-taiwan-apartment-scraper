{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious, high-end modern apartment on the 15th floor with premium finishes including hardwood flooring, recessed/cove LED lighting, stone accent wall, and large panoramic windows providing excellent natural light with mountain views. The living area is very clean and well-maintained with a large leather sectional sofa and glass coffee table; the open layout with smooth tile and wood flooring and no visible stairs is baby-friendly, though the glass-top coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. An 18-story building at this price point in Xinyi almost certainly has an elevator. Listed via An-Ho Real Estate (安禾房屋); note the description is minimal broker boilerplate with no substantive apartment details, which is a minor red flag — request more photos of kitchen, bathrooms, and bedrooms before committing."}
