{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern recessed lighting, new light wood flooring, fresh white walls, and modern AC unit. The space is very clean and bright with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the apartment appears single-level with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access; corners on built-in features are relatively soft but the louvered closet doors have slats a child could potentially climb."}
