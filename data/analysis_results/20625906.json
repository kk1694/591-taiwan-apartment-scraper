{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Very spacious apartment (63.69 ping) with hardwood floors throughout and a mix of traditional Chinese carved rosewood furniture and Western-style upholstered seating. The unit is clean and well-maintained but dated in style with older window-mounted AC units alongside a ceiling cassette unit. For baby safety, the glass-top coffee table and carved wooden furniture with sharp ornamental edges are significant concerns, and the large windows with low sill storage cabinets could be climbing hazards. Good natural light from large windows in the living room and bedroom; listed through UR HOUSE, an agency specializing in foreign tenants, which is a plus for a foreign couple."}
