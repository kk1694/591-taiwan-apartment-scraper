The unit is clean with good natural light from balcony windows and built-in LED lighting. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, the balcony has low railings visible from outside, and the rooftop pool area would require supervision; the open floor plan with string curtain room divider provides no door separation between living and sleeping areas."}
