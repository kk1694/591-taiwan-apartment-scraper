The glass coffee table with sharp metal edges and the elevated platform bed frame are baby safety concerns that would need childproofing. Natural light appears limited as all windows are covered by heavy curtains; the dark flooring and moody lighting give a hotel-like atmosphere but the overall condition is excellent and very clean."}
