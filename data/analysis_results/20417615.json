{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment on 14th floor of a 19-story building with recessed lighting, central AC, polished tile floors, and built-in wood cabinetry. The kitchen has a full-size fridge, gas stove, and range hood with a sliding glass door to a balcony. The bathroom is spacious with a glass-enclosed shower. For baby safety, the balcony access via sliding doors and the glass shower enclosure are concerns; the balcony railings visible in image 1 appear to have adequate height but should be verified in person. Good natural light from multiple windows, and the unit is very clean with no visible red flags. The minimal description suggests this is an agent listing so expect broker fees."}
