{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very spacious apartment (~51 ping) with clean light-colored wood-look flooring and recessed/track lighting, but the overall style is dated Taiwanese renovation (coffered ceilings, old-style window grilles, heavy leather sofas). The unit appears clean and well-maintained with good natural light from large windows with security grilles. For baby safety: the open floor plan is a plus with lots of crawling space, windows have metal security grilles which is good, but the listing only shows the living areas — no kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom photos are visible, and the description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag suggesting this may be a bait listing or very minimal disclosure. No elevator info available for this older 6-floor building on 2F."}
