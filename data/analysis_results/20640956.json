{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Spacious and modern apartment at 44.8 ping with clean white interior, recessed lighting, light wood flooring, and a large open-plan living/dining area with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors with balcony access. At least two bedrooms visible with built-in furniture, TVs, and window blinds. For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors should be secured with child locks, and the coffee table has some sharp corners to watch for; the low window in the master bedroom is also a concern once the baby is mobile. Building appears to be a modern high-rise (4F/12F) which almost certainly has an elevator, and the overall condition is very clean and well-maintained."}
