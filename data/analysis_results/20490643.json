{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, stylishly furnished apartment with high ceilings in the living room, contemporary fixtures, recessed lighting, and a sleek minimalist design. The low platform bed and smooth tile floors are relatively baby-friendly, though the glass coffee table and small decorative items in the living room would need to be secured. Good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room and bedroom windows with zebra blinds; the unit appears very clean and newly renovated, but the description is only a generic agent advertisement with no useful details about the property itself, which is a minor red flag."}
