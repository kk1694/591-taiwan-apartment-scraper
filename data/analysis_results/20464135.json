{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern light wood laminate flooring, track lighting, and split AC units. Kitchen is updated with white cabinetry and modern Panasonic refrigerator. Very spacious open layout at 45 ping with good natural light from balcony windows. For baby safety: no visible stairs and floors are smooth, but exposed electrical panels in hallway and pipes along walls would need childproofing. Clean condition overall."}
