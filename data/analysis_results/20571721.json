{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious ground floor apartment with dated finishes - older window-unit AC, basic laminate flooring showing some wear, and minimal natural light from small windows. The open layout is good for a baby, but the entry door with metal security gates and exposed wiring near the ceiling are concerns. Being on 1F of a 5-story walkup building means no elevator, and ground floor units in Taiwan can have humidity and security issues."}
