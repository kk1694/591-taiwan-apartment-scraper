{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment with mezzanine sleeping area accessed by steep stairs with a curved metal railing — a significant baby safety hazard as the open loft edge and staircase pose fall risks. The unit is clean and well-furnished with white decor, but the loft layout makes it impractical for a family with a baby. The building is upscale with rooftop pool and well-equipped gym, strongly suggesting elevator access; however the actual living space appears compact and narrow despite the 13-ping listing."}
