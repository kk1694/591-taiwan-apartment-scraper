{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern wood flooring, recessed lighting, and updated kitchen with sleek blue cabinets and gas stove. Clean condition with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the balcony area visible in the dining room and bar stools may need attention; corners on furniture appear rounded but the elevated bed frame has sharp edges to consider."}
