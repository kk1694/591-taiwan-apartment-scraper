{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with sleek finishes, marble-pattern tile floors, contemporary furniture, and built-in cabinetry. The unit is exceptionally clean with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety, the balcony has adequate railing but the glass coffee tables have sharp edges; the open floor plan and tile floors are easy to clean but slippery. Building appears to be a newer high-rise (4F/14F) which typically has elevators in Taiwan."}
