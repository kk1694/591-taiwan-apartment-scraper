{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern finishes including LED strip lighting, sleek kitchen with induction cooktop, and contemporary furniture. The space is very clean with smooth surfaces and rounded furniture edges that are relatively baby-safe, though the open kitchen layout would need childproofing for cabinet access. Good natural light from large windows with sheer curtains; at 13 ping it is compact for a growing family but well-designed."}
