{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed lighting, modern glass partition doors, and quality furnishings. The space appears very clean with good natural light from windows. For baby safety: no visible balcony in photos, the coffee tables have rounded edges, and floors are smooth tile - generally safe though the glass partition doors would need childproofing. The small room could work well as a nursery."}
