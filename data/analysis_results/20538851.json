{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a hotel room rather than a residential apartment - it has twin beds with hotel-style bedding, a desk setup typical of hotel rooms, and hotel-grade bathroom amenities with folded towels. The space is very modern and clean with high-end finishes, but the hotel-style layout and lack of kitchen facilities make it unsuitable for a family with a baby. No balcony visible, but also no living space or kitchen for baby care needs."}
