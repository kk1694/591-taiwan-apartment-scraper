{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern industrial-style loft with spiral staircase, polished concrete floors, brick accent wall, stainless steel kitchen, and mezzanine bedroom. Major baby safety concern: the open spiral staircase with metal steps and the mezzanine railing are dangerous for a crawling baby/toddler and would need gates. The loft bedroom has low ceilings and limited natural light; the kitchen has a small balcony providing some daylight. Clean and well-maintained but the duplex layout with steep stairs is impractical for a couple with a baby."}
