{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end custom built-in cabinetry, recessed LED lighting, and clean minimalist design throughout. The flat tile floors, rounded cabinet edges, and lack of visible stairs are positive for baby safety, though the glass display cabinet with shelves could be a concern for a crawling toddler. The 13-story building on the 5th floor almost certainly has an elevator; natural light appears decent from windows visible behind curtains, and the overall condition is excellent and move-in ready."}
