{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a multi-level townhouse-style unit (1F with internal staircase visible in dining area photo) with clean white tile floors and freshly painted walls. The furniture is older traditional Taiwanese wooden style and the overall feel is dated but well-maintained. Major baby safety concern: the internal staircase has no visible gate or railing protection and would need baby-proofing; windows have security bars which is good. Natural light appears limited with small windows in bedrooms, and the 1F location in a 6-story walk-up building means no elevator access to the street, though being on the ground floor is convenient for stroller access."}
