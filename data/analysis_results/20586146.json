{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern minimalist design, new wood-grain flooring, sleek kitchen cabinetry, recessed lighting, wall-mounted TV, and split AC units in bedrooms. The space appears to have at least 2 bedrooms with a separate living/dining area, good natural light from large windows, and is very clean. For baby safety, the windows appear to have metal security grilles which is good, no visible balcony hazards, and corners on furniture are relatively rounded; being on the 6th floor of a 7-story building with no confirmed elevator could be a concern for carrying a stroller and baby supplies."}
