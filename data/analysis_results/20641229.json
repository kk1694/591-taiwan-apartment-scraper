{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Lishuei Street Lane 21, Da'an District, near Yongkang commercial area and Daan Forest Park", "notes": "3BR whole-floor apartment in excellent Da'an location near MRT, Yongkang Street, and Daan Forest Park. Comes furnished with appliances; cooking and pets allowed. For a couple with a baby: the 3F/4F walkup does have elevator access listed, which helps with strollers. The balcony needs inspection for railing safety. Renovation was 3+ years ago so condition is uncertain - an in-person visit is recommended to check for sharp corners, window locks, and overall baby-proofing needs. The layout with 3 rooms provides good space for a nursery."}
