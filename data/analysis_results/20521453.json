{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with sleek white kitchen cabinets, recessed lighting, wood flooring, and contemporary furnishings. The unit appears very clean with good natural light from large windows with floor-to-ceiling curtains. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp edges and the balcony access should be verified for secure railings; otherwise the open floor plan and absence of stairs are positive for a family with young children."}
