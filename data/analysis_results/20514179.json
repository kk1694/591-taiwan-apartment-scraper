{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, spacious apartment with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and modern digital door lock. Good natural light from large windows with curtains. Mostly unfurnished with smooth surfaces - relatively baby-safe though hard tile floors would need rugs. The decorative ceiling molding and wall trim suggest an older building that has been well-maintained and updated."}
