{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern recessed/cove lighting, light wood-tone flooring, stylish glass-panel sliding doors separating kitchen, and updated bathroom with modern fixtures. The spacious 24-ping layout has an open living/dining area, a separate enclosed kitchen, and at least one bedroom with built-in closet and track lighting. The glass coffee table with sharp edges and the glass kitchen partition doors are minor baby safety concerns, but the flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus. Windows have security grilles; natural light appears moderate given window sizes. No bedrooms or balcony views are shown, so elevator status is unclear. The listing description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — ask for more details on layout, number of rooms, and lease terms."}
