{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with clean finishes, recessed lighting, and quality furnishings across living room, two bedrooms, and kitchen. The unit appears baby-friendly with no visible balconies, sharp corners appear minimal, and floor surfaces are smooth hardwood. Good natural light through large windows with blackout curtains; the 6th floor location in a 10-story building suggests elevator access but not confirmed."}
