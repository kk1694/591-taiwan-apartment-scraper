{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou", "notes": "Spacious 64-ping modern apartment on 8F/9F with wood flooring, recessed ceiling lighting, modern white kitchen with glass backsplash and dishwasher, and large windows providing good natural light. Note that images 3 and 5 are AI-rendered (marked AI示意圖), so the actual condition may differ from those idealized views; the real photos (1, 2, 4) show a well-maintained but lived-in space with some clutter. The glass coffee table in the living room and balcony access behind floor-to-ceiling windows are potential baby safety concerns that would need childproofing, but overall the flat layout with no stairs is suitable for a family with a baby."}
