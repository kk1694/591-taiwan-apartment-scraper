{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Well-decorated apartment with modern wood-toned cabinetry, grey laminate flooring, and a long green sofa. The space appears clean and well-maintained with decorative hot air balloon ornaments, though the narrow corridor-like layout and many small decorative objects (plants, figurines) could pose tripping/choking hazards for a baby. Listed through UR HOUSE housing rental services; only one image available so natural light and full layout cannot be fully assessed."}
