{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older but well-maintained apartment with hardwood floors throughout and decent built-in storage. Furnishings and appliances (wall-mounted AC units, older-style cabinets, dated sofa and mattresses) suggest a 1990s-2000s renovation rather than modern. Good natural light from large windows in living room and master bedroom; second bedroom has a smaller window with less light. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is a plus, but the hardwood floors and furniture corners (dining table, TV stand) would need edge guards. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — at 65K/month for Da'an this is reasonably priced for 36 ping but the lack of detail and the dated condition suggest it may have been on the market a while."}
