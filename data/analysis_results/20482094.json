{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with modern recessed/cove lighting, polished stone tile floors in living area and wood laminate in bedrooms. The living room is large with floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors leading to a balcony with visible railings—balcony access would need baby-proofing. The bedrooms are generously sized with AC units and good artificial lighting, though natural light appears moderate with smaller windows. At 71.8 ping on the 5th floor of a 14-story building, it almost certainly has an elevator; the unit is clean with no major red flags, though the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding for a crawling baby."}
