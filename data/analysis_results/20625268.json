{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment in Da'an with modern recessed lighting, split AC units, clean white tile floors in living/dining areas and warm hardwood in bedrooms. The living room is large with an L-shaped sofa, and bedrooms have built-in wardrobes and desks; the overall condition is clean and move-in ready. For baby safety, the tile floors can be slippery, the coffee table has sharp corners, and the bedroom platform bed has a raised edge to watch for; natural light appears moderate through horizontal windows with curtains, and the 5th floor of a 12-story building very likely has an elevator."}
