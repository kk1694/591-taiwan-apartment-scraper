{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with decorative wood beam ceiling, hardwood floors throughout, and good natural light from large windows. The living area shows child-friendly items (toy car, stroller) suggesting current family use. Being on the 7th/top floor without visible elevator info is a concern; the low balcony railing visible in images could be a safety issue for a baby/toddler and would need childproofing."}
