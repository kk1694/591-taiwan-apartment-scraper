{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, modern light wood flooring, and updated kitchen with stainless steel refrigerator and white cabinetry. Good natural light from large windows with mountain views. For baby safety: the apartment appears single-level with no visible stairs, but the balcony area and bar stools could be concerns; no visible sharp corners on furniture. Being on 5F/5F (top floor) with no elevator evidence is a potential concern for a family with a stroller."}
