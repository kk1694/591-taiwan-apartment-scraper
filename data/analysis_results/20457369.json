{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious 63-ping apartment in clean, well-maintained condition with modern finishes including recessed/cove lighting, polished tile floors, decorative wallpaper, and a large U-shaped kitchen with gas stove and ample counter space. The living room is generously sized with large windows providing decent natural light; the tile floors are smooth and easy to clean but slippery for a crawling baby. For baby safety, the dining area has metal-legged furniture with sharp corners, and a balcony door is visible off the living room that would need a child gate; no stairs are visible. Listed through Dingli Rental Service agent; the description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout, bedrooms, and lease terms."}
