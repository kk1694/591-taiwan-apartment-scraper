{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained luxury apartment with elegant white decor, marble-pattern coffee table, and large windows providing excellent natural light. The open floor plan with no visible stairs and smooth tile flooring is good for baby safety, though the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. The large bay windows appear to have low railings at balcony level which may need childproofing once baby is mobile."}
