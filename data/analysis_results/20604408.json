{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Clean, bright apartment with modern LED panel lighting, white tiled floors, AC, and a compact but functional kitchen with induction cooktop and refrigerator. The glass coffee table with sharp metal edges and the balcony accessible via sliding doors on the 10th floor are baby safety concerns that would need childproofing. Good natural light from large windows, overall well-maintained condition, though the listing description is minimal (just a promotional ad) which is a minor red flag — request more details from the agent."}
