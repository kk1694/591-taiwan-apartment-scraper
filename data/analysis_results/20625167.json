{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern European-style decor, recessed LED lighting, and clean tile/wood flooring. The living room has a balcony with horizontal bar railings that would need securing for baby safety; glass coffee table corners are also a concern. Good natural light from large windows, very clean condition with quality furnishings."}
