{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment with new fixtures, recessed lighting, wood-look flooring, and built-in cabinetry throughout. Very clean and well-maintained with an open kitchen layout. Baby safety is generally good - no visible stairs, flat single-level layout, though the balcony with sliding glass door will need child-proofing; large windows provide good natural light but window ledge near bedroom may need attention when child becomes mobile."}
