{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Unfurnished apartment in clean but dated condition with polished tile floors, plain white walls, and older-style ceiling light fixtures. The unit is spacious at ~59 ping with multiple bedrooms, a bathroom with bathtub, and AC units in bedrooms. For baby safety, the tile floors are very hard (falls would be painful), the bathtub lacks a non-slip surface, and windows have security bars which are good for child safety but the bathroom has a glass shelf at low height that could be a hazard. Natural light is moderate from bedroom windows but the living room appears to rely on artificial light. Being completely unfurnished means significant upfront costs to make it livable."}
