{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a former office or commercial space, not a residential apartment. The main area has fluorescent ceiling grid lights, office desks, rolling chairs, and metal shelving — clearly an office layout with no living or bedroom areas visible. The space is cluttered with disassembled furniture, metal frames, and doors stacked against walls, suggesting it is in a state of disuse or transition. The bathroom and kitchen are old and poorly maintained with stained tiles and exposed plumbing. Completely unsuitable for a couple with a baby — no residential fixtures, no natural light in main rooms, dirty floors with debris, and the commercial nature of the space means it likely lacks proper residential zoning or amenities."}
