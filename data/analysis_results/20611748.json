{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern finishes including curved TV wall feature, recessed lighting, light wood flooring, and built-in storage throughout. The balcony has metal security grilles which are good for baby safety. The unit appears very clean with contemporary furniture and AC units. For baby concerns: the coffee table has relatively sharp corners, and the balcony door leads to a narrow utility/laundry area. Natural light is moderate, mainly from the balcony sliding doors."}
