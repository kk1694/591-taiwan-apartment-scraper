Very clean and spacious at nearly 40 ping. For baby safety: balcony has proper railings visible through sliding doors, furniture has rounded edges, and floors are smooth tile throughout. Natural light appears decent with floor-to-ceiling windows in living room and bedroom. No red flags - this is a premium unit managed by UR House rental services."}
