{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent modern apartment with high-end finishes including open-plan kitchen with built-in oven, sleek white cabinetry, and polished tile flooring throughout. Very clean and spacious with good natural light from large windows and balcony access. Baby safety considerations: balconies have horizontal railings that could be climbable, but sliding glass doors provide a secure barrier; no visible sharp corners or stairs. The 12-story building at floor 5 strongly suggests elevator access."}
