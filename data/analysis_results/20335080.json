{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern renovated apartment with high-end finishes including marble countertops, recessed LED lighting, wood-look flooring, smart toilet, and a bathtub. The living area features a glass partition wall which could be a concern for baby safety, and the raised marble counter/island has sharp edges. The space is spacious at 48 ping with at least two bedrooms, two bathrooms, good natural light from multiple windows, and is very clean. Managed by UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly agency). At 5F with no elevator confirmed, carrying a stroller could be challenging."}
