{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with recessed lighting, clean white tile floors, built-in cabinetry, AC, and a compact but functional kitchen with gas stove, range hood, microwave, and refrigerator. The bedroom has large windows providing decent natural light and a mirrored sliding-door wardrobe. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp metal edges in the living room is a concern, and the balcony sliding doors should be checked for secure child locks. The apartment is on the 9th floor of an 18-story building, almost certainly with an elevator, and appears very clean and move-in ready overall."}
