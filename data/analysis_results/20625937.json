{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Brand new or near-new modern apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, central air conditioning, and a sleek modern kitchen with built-in cabinets. The unit is completely unfurnished and very clean with no visible hazards for a baby — flat single-level layout with no stairs, and the balcony appears to have floor-to-ceiling glass doors. Listed through Miller House agency; the 26-floor building on the 8th floor strongly suggests elevator access. Note the description is just an agent promotion with no real listing details, which is a minor red flag — request full details directly."}
