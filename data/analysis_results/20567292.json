{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with stylish designer furniture, LED accent lighting, induction cooktop, and high-quality finishes throughout. The space is clean, well-furnished with a large TV, sofa, dining table, and compact but modern kitchen. For baby safety: the flat floor layout on 1F is convenient (no stairs inside), but the coffee table has rounded edges which is good; the kitchen is open-plan so baby gates would be needed. Being on the 1st floor means easy stroller access but potentially less natural light and more street noise. No bedroom or bathroom photos were shown, which is a notable gap — only 5 images covering the living area and kitchen."}
