{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, hotel-style studio apartment with high-end finishes including induction cooktop, built-in cabinetry, LED accent lighting, and light wood flooring. The unit is immaculately clean and well-staged. Being on the 6th/top floor with a small balcony visible in image 1, the balcony railing spacing should be checked for baby safety; the compact kitchenette and limited floor space may feel tight once baby gear is added. Natural light appears decent from the floor-to-ceiling window, but only 5 photos were provided showing mostly the bedroom — no bathroom or living area shown, which is a minor red flag for a 15-ping unit at NT$50K."}
