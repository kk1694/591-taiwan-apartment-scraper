{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated traditional Chinese rosewood furniture throughout, including carved sofa set, large round dining table with lazy susan, and heavy wooden bed frame. The unit is spacious at 29 ping with a separate kitchen featuring basic cabinetry and gas stove, but all fixtures and furnishings are from the 1980s-90s era with window-unit AC and iron window bars. For baby safety, the heavy carved wooden furniture has many sharp corners and edges that would need padding, though the tile floors are flat and the windows have security bars; the overall condition is clean but very dated, and natural light appears limited with small barred windows."}
