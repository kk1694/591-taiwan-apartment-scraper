{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 3-bedroom apartment in good condition with modern built-in cabinetry, LED cove lighting, large leather sectional sofa, and a full kitchen with cooktop and appliances. The living room has smooth tile floors and the bedrooms have hardwood flooring with built-in wardrobes and desks. For baby safety, the glass coffee table in the living room has sharp metal edges, and the kitchen is a narrow galley style with exposed shelving that a toddler could pull over; windows appear to have security grilles which is a plus. Natural light seems moderate — bedroom windows are not large and some face close neighbors. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag suggesting this may be a brokerage listing with fees."}
