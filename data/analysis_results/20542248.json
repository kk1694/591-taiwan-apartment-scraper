{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Brand new or near-new unfurnished apartment in a modern high-rise (7F/27F) with pristine polished tile floors, recessed lighting, split AC units, and multiple rooms visible from the open living area. The spacious balcony has glass panel railings which are a serious baby safety concern—the horizontal rails and glass panels could be climbable, and the 7th floor height makes this critical to address with childproofing. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with mountain views; the unit is very clean and move-in ready, though being unfurnished means all furniture must be provided."}
