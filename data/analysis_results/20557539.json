{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern Japanese-style wood flooring throughout, built-in lighting, and sliding glass partition doors. The space appears clean with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, note the balcony access in room 4 with sliding door at floor level, and the glass partition doors between rooms could be a concern if baby starts crawling. Multiple rooms provide flexibility for a nursery setup."}
