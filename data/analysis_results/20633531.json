{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Spacious, well-renovated modern apartment with high-gloss tile floors, recessed and indirect LED lighting, stylish dark wood-grain TV wall feature, open-concept kitchen with breakfast bar, built-in dishwasher, gas stove, and range hood. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access. The polished tile floors could be slippery for a crawling baby, and the open balcony with low-rail access visible through the large glass doors is a safety concern that would need child-proofing. Listed through HOYUAN Real Estate Agency, a firm specializing in foreigner rentals, which is a positive sign for English-speaking tenants. The unit is unfurnished, very clean, and in move-in ready condition at 53 ping which is very generous for a young family."}
