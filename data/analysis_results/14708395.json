{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, bright apartment with clean white finishes, recessed lighting, and high-quality fixtures throughout. The open floor plan with glass partitions and ample natural light is excellent. For baby safety, note the glass coffee table with sharp corners and the glass partition walls that may need padding; the hard tile floors are easy to clean but would benefit from area rugs for a crawling baby."}
