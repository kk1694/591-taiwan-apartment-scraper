{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style duplex apartment with clean renovation, wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, split AC units, and large windows providing good natural light. The internal staircase to the mezzanine level is a significant baby safety concern — it has open metal railings with wide gaps and no gate, and the upper loft area has a glass half-wall railing overlooking the lower floor which would be dangerous for a crawling toddler. The balcony also has horizontal bar railings that a child could climb; baby gates at the stairs and balcony door would be essential."}
