{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious modern apartment with high-end finishes including marble floors, recessed lighting, open kitchen with built-in appliances, and elegant wainscoting. The hard marble floors and sharp-edged furniture (dining table, coffee table) pose baby safety concerns; the balcony with glass door access is visible but railings appear adequate. Excellent natural light from multiple large windows, very clean and well-maintained condition."}
