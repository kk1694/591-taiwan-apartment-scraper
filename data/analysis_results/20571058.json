{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes, open-plan living/dining/kitchen, wood flooring, and built-in storage. Good natural light from multiple windows. Baby safety note: there is a raised platform/step in the living area that could be a tripping hazard for toddlers; the coffee table has sharp metal corners. Overall very clean and well-maintained."}
