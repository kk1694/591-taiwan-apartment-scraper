{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment with polished hardwood floors and built-in wooden cabinetry in a traditional Taiwanese style, well-maintained but not modern. The unit is very clean with good natural light from bay windows and multiple rooms with split AC units; at 48.3 ping it offers generous space for a family. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) with no visible elevator info is a concern, and the window grilles provide safety but the bay windows could be a climbing hazard for a toddler; the description is minimal (just a broker ad) which is a minor red flag."}
