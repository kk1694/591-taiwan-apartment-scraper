{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, spacious unfurnished apartment with modern white tile flooring, AC units, and industrial-style pendant lights. The space appears to be used as an office (desk, office chairs visible) rather than residential. For baby safety: hard tile floors throughout, balcony access with sliding doors needs childproofing, minimal furniture means fewer sharp corners but no soft surfaces. Good natural light from balcony windows; some visible ceiling cracks and incomplete baseboard trim near door suggest minor maintenance issues."}
