{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment in excellent condition with clean white walls, recessed LED lighting, split AC, large flat-screen TV with built-in entertainment unit, stainless steel fridge, washing machine, built-in desk area, intercom system, and a platform bed with storage drawers. The floor on 6F of an 11-story building strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the smooth tile and wood-laminate floors are easy to clean, no visible stairs or dangerous railings, but the raised platform bed could be a fall hazard for a crawling toddler; the small nesting coffee tables have rounded edges which is good. Natural light appears limited based on window sizes, but the unit is very clean and move-in ready."}
