{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment (40 ping) with hardwood floors, decorative ceiling moldings, and traditional furnishings. The living room is large with sofa set, TV, and a separate dining area with ornate ceiling light panel. Condition is clean but dated — ceiling fans, older-style windows, and traditional Chinese decor suggest a 1990s-era renovation. For baby safety, the glass-top coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the low window sills in the dining area could be a concern; however the floor is flat hardwood throughout with no stairs visible. Being on the 4th floor of a 7-story building without confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller and baby gear."}
