{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older renovated apartment with parquet wood flooring in living/dining areas and terrazzo in the bedroom. The unit has a charming vintage feel with glass panel doors, subway tile kitchen, and multiple AC units, but fixtures and finishes are dated. For a baby, the glass-paneled doors with hinges could pose pinch hazards, and the lack of elevator on 2F means carrying a stroller up stairs; the windows have security bars which is good for child safety but natural light appears limited with frosted/barred windows throughout."}
