{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Spacious 3-bedroom apartment with dated but well-maintained furnishings from roughly the 2000s era; the living room has built-in cabinetry, leather sofa, and tile floors, while bedrooms have hardwood flooring and built-in wardrobes. The kitchen is functional with a dish dryer, stove, and large fridge but appears cluttered with cleaning supplies and exposed ductwork. For baby safety, the tile and hardwood floors are good, no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access, but the coffee table has sharp metal corners and the kitchen area would need baby-gating; windows appear to have security grilles which is a plus."}
