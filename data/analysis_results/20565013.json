{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Minquan West Road Section 160 Lane, Datong District, near Daqiaotou MRT (275m)", "notes": "3BR/2BA full-floor unit in an 18-story elevator building near Daqiaotou MRT. Comes fully furnished with appliances, balcony, natural gas cooking, and parking. The listing description is minimal (appears to be a generic agent posting), so condition and modernity cannot be confirmed from photos. For a couple expecting a baby, note the balcony (check railing height/gaps), the no-pets policy, and the NT$5,000/month management fee on top of rent. Good family layout with 3 bedrooms at 31 ping."}
