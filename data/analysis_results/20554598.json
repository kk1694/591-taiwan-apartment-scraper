{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment in excellent condition with sleek minimalist decor, light wood cabinetry, modern LED lighting, and polished tile floors. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), the 34-ping space features a spacious living/dining area, modern bathroom with bathtub and quality fixtures, and a utility balcony with washing machine and metal railings. For baby safety, the coffee table has rounded edges which is good, but the balcony railings should be checked for gap width; the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from soft mats. At 14 floors the building almost certainly has an elevator, and the unit on 3F gets decent natural light through vertical blinds."}
