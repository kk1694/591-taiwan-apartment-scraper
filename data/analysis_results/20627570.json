{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment on 12F with sleek finishes including wood laminate flooring, designer furniture, marble-look accent walls, split AC, and stylish lighting fixtures; Taipei 101 visible from the living room windows suggesting prime Xinyi location. The glass coffee table with sharp edges is a baby safety concern, and the floor-to-ceiling windows need child locks, but the flat single-level layout with no stairs is good for a family. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with good natural light from large windows, though the description is minimal (agent placeholder text only) which is a minor red flag — recommend visiting in person to verify condition and check for additional rooms not shown."}
