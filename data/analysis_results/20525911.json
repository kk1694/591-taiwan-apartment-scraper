{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including polished tile flooring in the living room, hardwood floors in bedrooms, built-in wardrobes, recessed lighting, and split AC units. The living area is very clean with a large leather sofa and built-in TV cabinet. For baby safety, the windows have security grilles which is good, but the polished tile floors in the living room could be very slippery; the glass sliding doors between rooms and some sharp-cornered furniture (coffee table, TV stand) would need baby-proofing. Natural light appears decent from the bedroom windows, and the overall condition is excellent with no visible red flags. Listed through Miller House rental agency."}
