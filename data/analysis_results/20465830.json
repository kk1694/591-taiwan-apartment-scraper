{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated furniture and fixtures from the 1990s-2000s era, including traditional wooden bed frames and vintage cabinetry. The unit has good natural light from large windows and a balcony, but being on the 9th/top floor with enclosed balconies poses baby safety concerns. The space is clean and spacious with laminate flooring throughout, but the overall condition is worn with visible aging on walls and fixtures."}
