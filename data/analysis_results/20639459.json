{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern renovation with marble accents, recessed LED lighting, and premium finishes throughout. The space is very clean with smooth corners and minimal baby hazards; the balcony visible through sliding glass doors has metal railings that appear secure. Being on 1F eliminates stair concerns but may have slightly less natural light; the covered entrance corridor suggests a well-maintained building."}
