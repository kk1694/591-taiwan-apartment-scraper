{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Excellent luxury apartment with high-end modern finishes including designer lighting, marble accent walls, quality wood flooring, and built-in cabinetry. Very spacious open layout with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the round coffee table has smooth edges which is good, and the open floor plan provides safe crawling space, though the glass cabinet doors and sharp-cornered dining furniture may need childproofing."}
