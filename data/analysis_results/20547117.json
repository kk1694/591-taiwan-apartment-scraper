{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or recently renovated high-floor apartment with pristine marble-look flooring, recessed lighting, and modern finishes throughout. Excellent natural light from large windows with high floor views. For baby safety: no visible stairs, flat single-level layout appears safe, but the balcony with horizontal railings (image 1) would need childproofing; windows appear to be secure sliding types. Very clean, unfurnished condition with central air conditioning."}
