{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment at 75.8 ping with modern recessed lighting, granite-style tile floors in the living room, and wood flooring in the master bedroom. The living room has a large balcony with proper railings visible through sliding glass doors; the balcony railings appear to be of adequate height but should be verified in person for baby safety. Multiple windows across both bedrooms provide good natural light, and the overall condition is clean with relatively modern furnishings, though the description is minimal (agent listing placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag — suggest confirming actual layout details and amenities directly with the agent."}
