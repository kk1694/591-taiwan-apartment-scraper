{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Very modern, newly built apartment in a high-rise (8F/26F) with clean white tile floors, recessed LED lighting, modern kitchen with induction cooktop, glass backsplash, and stainless steel refrigerator. Bathroom features contemporary grey tile with glass shower partition. The unit appears completely unfurnished, which is good for customizing baby-safe layouts. Smooth tile floors may be slippery for a crawling baby; large windows have secure frames but no visible balcony, reducing fall risk. Managed by UR House (foreigner-friendly rental agency), which is a positive sign for foreign tenants. Good natural light from large windows. At 34 ping this is a spacious family-sized unit at a reasonable price for Nangang."}
