{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Renovated apartment with high ceilings featuring decorative exposed wood beams, clean white tile floors in the living area and wood flooring in bedrooms, split AC units, and built-in wardrobes. The 5th floor walkup in an older building (no elevator evidence) is a concern for a pregnant woman; the living room has large dark-framed windows that may lead to a balcony requiring child-safety checks. Overall the unit is clean and spacious at 24 ping with good natural light potential, though the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — confirm details directly with the Miller House agent."}
