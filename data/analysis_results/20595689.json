{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Very modern, beautifully renovated apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, modern open kitchen with gas stove, split AC, and large flat-screen TV. The space is spacious at 47 ping with excellent natural light from large dark-framed windows. For baby safety, the glossy tile floors could be slippery and the low coffee table has sharp corners, but overall the flat layout with no visible stairs is good; no balcony railings visible in images. Listed via Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), suggesting foreigner-friendly terms. The description is minimal (agent boilerplate only), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and room count."}
