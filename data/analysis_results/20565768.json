{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylish loft-style apartment with traditional Taiwanese wood accents, exposed beams, and modern fixtures including AC. Major baby safety concerns: steep wooden tansu stairs to loft area, a ladder to another loft space, glass coffee table with sharp edges, and open balcony access. Good natural light from large windows but the multi-level design with stairs and ladders is problematic for a family with a baby or toddler."}
