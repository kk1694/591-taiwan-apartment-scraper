{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment with double-height ceiling, stylish pendant lighting, and clean white tile floors downstairs with dark hardwood in the mezzanine bedroom. The mezzanine/loft layout is a major baby safety concern — there is an open metal railing with glass panels overlooking the living area, and stairs to the upper sleeping level would be dangerous for a crawling baby or toddler. Kitchen is compact but modern with a breakfast bar. Good natural light from large windows with city views. Overall clean and well-maintained, but the loft design makes this poorly suited for a family with a baby without significant childproofing."}
