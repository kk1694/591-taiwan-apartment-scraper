{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Very clean, modern unfurnished apartment with polished white tile floors, recessed lighting, multiple split AC units, and large black-framed windows providing excellent natural light with city views. The spacious 40-ping layout appears to have multiple rooms with a hallway connecting them; the open floor plan and lack of stairs or sharp fixtures make it relatively baby-safe, though the hard tile floors would benefit from play mats. Being on the 5th floor of an 11-story modern building strongly suggests elevator access; the unit is completely empty so all furnishing would need to be provided, but the pristine condition and generous size are ideal for a growing family."}
