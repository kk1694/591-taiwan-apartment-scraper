{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial or office space rather than a residential apartment - the layout shows a very large open floor plan with industrial tile flooring, exposed wiring, and no visible kitchen or bathroom fixtures typical of homes. The space has low ceilings, dated finishes, and would require significant renovation. Not suitable for a family with a baby due to the commercial nature and condition."}
