{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated apartment in Da'an with high-end finishes including recessed LED lighting, hardwood floors, open-plan kitchen with bar counter, built-in shelving, and a dedicated study/storage room. The space is clean, spacious at 37 ping, and on the 2nd floor of a 13-story building (likely has elevator). For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows need child locks, the bar stools with metal bases are a tipping hazard, and the open kitchen island has sharp corners that would need padding. Natural light is decent with greenery visible outside the windows, though being on the 2nd floor means some views are partially blocked by landscaping. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — worth confirming layout details and whether bathroom/kitchen photos are available."}
