{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft apartment on top floor (8F/8F) with interior staircase leading to a mezzanine bedroom level with sloped ceilings. Clean condition with updated kitchen, LED cove lighting, AC units, and stylish rattan furniture. Major baby safety concern: the internal staircase has thin horizontal metal railings with wide gaps that a child could slip through, and the low-clearance mezzanine bedrooms have limited headroom. Natural light appears limited with small windows, mostly visible only in the kitchen and upper bedroom areas."}
