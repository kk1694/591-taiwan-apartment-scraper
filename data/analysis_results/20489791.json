{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious apartment (51 ping) with renovated but dated-style interiors — recessed ceiling with cove lighting, track lighting, and older-style built-in cabinetry with glass doors suggest a 1990s-2000s renovation rather than truly modern finishes. The unit is clean and mostly empty with light wood-tone flooring and AC units. For baby safety, the large open floor plan is a plus, but the marble-look coffee table has sharp corners, and the balcony area visible through sliding glass doors would need child-proofing; being on 2F of a 6F walkup building (no elevator evidence) means carrying a stroller up stairs. Managed by UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), which is convenient but the description is just a generic ad with no real property details, which is a minor red flag."}
