{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious, well-maintained apartment with high-end finishes including polished marble floors in living areas, recessed ceiling lighting, central AC, and elegant chandeliers. The spacious living room and two bedrooms with wood flooring are in excellent condition. For baby safety, the polished marble floors in the common areas are very slippery which is a concern for a crawling/walking baby; the hard stone corners along the dark marble border strips could also pose a bump risk. Windows appear to have secure frames, and no dangerous balcony access is visible in the photos. At 53.82 ping on the 5th floor of a 14-story building, this is a generously sized, upscale unit likely with elevator access."}
