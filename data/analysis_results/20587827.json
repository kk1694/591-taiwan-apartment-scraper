{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Rongfu Park (榮富公園), Beitou District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated interior decor including retro marble-patterned wall paneling and louvered doors. The unit is on the 6th floor of a 9-story building with large bay windows offering good natural light and open city views. The neighborhood appears well-maintained with a nearby park (Rongfu Park) which is great for families, but the building exterior looks like a typical older Taiwanese walk-up community. Only one interior photo was provided, making it hard to fully assess baby safety; the wide window ledge could be a climbing hazard for a toddler and would need child-proofing. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — more details and interior photos should be requested before visiting."}
