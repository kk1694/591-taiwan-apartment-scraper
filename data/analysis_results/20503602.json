{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious renovated apartment (~30 ping) with modern kitchen featuring L-shaped counters, glass backsplash, gas stove, and built-in oven/microwave. Living areas have light wood laminate and dark hardwood flooring, recessed lighting, and split AC units. Managed by UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly agency). For baby safety, the glass/marble coffee table has sharp corners, and the sliding panel doors with glass inserts could be a pinch hazard; the bedroom window has iron security grilles which is good for child safety. Natural light appears moderate — some rooms look inward-facing with limited window exposure. The listing description is minimal (just an ad for agent packages), which is a minor red flag — would need to confirm layout details and actual number of rooms in person."}
