{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial or office space rather than a residential apartment. The interior shows empty rooms with commercial-style fluorescent grid lighting, drop ceiling tiles, vertical blinds, and bare white tile floors — all hallmarks of an office unit. There is no kitchen, bathroom, or any residential furnishings visible. The 1F location and office-like fit-out are major red flags; this is unsuitable for a couple expecting a baby as it would require significant conversion to become livable, and natural light appears limited with covered windows."}
