{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including marble-look TV wall, recessed lighting, split AC units, wood-tone laminate flooring, and a fully equipped kitchen with washer-dryer. The unit appears to be a loft-style layout with high ceilings and a mezzanine level (visible glass railing above the living room), which is a significant baby safety concern — the upper level stairs and open railing would need childproofing. Natural light comes from the window-bar area but the living room and bedroom appear to rely mostly on artificial lighting. Clean and well-maintained overall, but the loft stairs and elevated areas are a red flag for a household with a baby or toddler."}
