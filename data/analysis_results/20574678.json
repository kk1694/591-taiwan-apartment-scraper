{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "The listing description is essentially empty, containing only a generic promotional message for the real estate agent platform rather than any actual property details. At 30 ping (99 sqm) for NT$69,000/month in Xinyi District, this is a reasonably sized unit at a moderate price point. Without photos or a meaningful description, it is impossible to assess modernity, elevator access, baby safety features, or overall condition — an in-person visit is strongly recommended."}
