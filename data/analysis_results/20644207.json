{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious, brand-new modern apartment in excellent condition with high-end finishes, recessed lighting, large windows providing abundant natural light, and quality built-in storage. For baby safety, the unit is single-level with no stairs, windows appear secure, and floors are smooth tile/wood without sharp edges; the open kitchen island may need baby-proofing once the child becomes mobile. The building is a high-rise (15F/21F) which very likely has an elevator, and the views suggest proximity to Taipei 101 in Xinyi."}
