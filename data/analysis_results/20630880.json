{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older building with dated finishes — traditional carved wooden front door, drop ceiling tiles, and older-style wooden TV cabinet suggest a 1980s-90s era building. The living area is spacious and clean with laminate flooring, large sliding glass doors to a balcony, and recessed lighting. Bedrooms have hardwood floors, wall-mounted AC units, and decent natural light. For baby safety, the balcony sliding doors would need childproof locks, and the hard flooring throughout has no padding; being on the 3rd floor of a 4-story walk-up with no elevator could be challenging with a stroller and baby gear."}
