{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, spacious apartment in excellent condition with clean white walls, recessed LED lighting, modern chandelier, and polished tile flooring. The 47-ping space is generous with a large living area, dining set, and L-shaped sofa configuration. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp-cornered coffee table would need padding, but the open floor plan is a plus; large floor-to-ceiling windows provide good natural light but curtains suggest no balcony access from the living room. Being on the 6th floor of an 18-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Listed through An Ho Real Estate (安禾房屋) agency; the description is minimal (just an agent promo), so bedroom/bathroom count and kitchen details are unknown — only the living/dining area is shown."}
