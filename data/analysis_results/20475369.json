{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment in excellent condition with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, and contemporary furnishings. The 15-story building on the 5th floor strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners and the balcony visible from bedroom needs railings verified; the unit has good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows and appears very clean with no visible red flags."}
