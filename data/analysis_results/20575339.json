{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean duplex apartment with sleek white kitchen, LED lighting, and updated appliances. Has internal stairs leading to a loft bedroom area with low sloped ceilings - significant baby safety concern due to steep stairs without visible gates/railings and the elevated loft design. Good natural light from large windows, but some windows have privacy film limiting views. Very clean condition overall."}
