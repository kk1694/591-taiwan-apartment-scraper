{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Tianmu, Shilin", "notes": "Well-appointed modern apartment with warm wood-paneled walls, recessed lighting, hardwood floors, and a spacious living room. The agent watermark references Tianmu/Shilin/Beitou area. For baby safety, the iron bed frame in the bedroom has decorative curly metalwork with potential pinch points, and image 4 shows a balcony with metal railings visible through a large window — the railing spacing should be verified in person. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding. At 6F/7F with no elevator info, confirm elevator access as carrying a stroller up 6 floors would be impractical. Overall the unit is clean, well-maintained, and has good natural light from large windows, but the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request full details directly."}
