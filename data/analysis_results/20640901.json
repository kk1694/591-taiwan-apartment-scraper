{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and well-designed studio apartment with high-end finishes including LED strip lighting, marble accents, wood paneling, and stylish fixtures. The space is compact (11 ping) but efficiently designed with built-in furniture. For baby safety, the glass doors/partitions and small balcony visible in image 3 may need childproofing; the stepped platform areas could also pose a fall risk for toddlers. Good natural light from multiple windows; overall very clean and well-maintained condition."}
