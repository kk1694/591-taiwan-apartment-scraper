{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and clean apartment with fresh white walls, light wood laminate flooring, and contemporary furniture including leather sofa and wall-mounted TV. The building appears to have an elevator based on the hallway view showing a well-maintained common corridor. For baby safety, the space is relatively open with few sharp corners, though the TV cords visible on the wall should be secured. Good natural light from windows in living area; bathroom visible with modern fixtures and appears clean."}
