The building has an elevator with a well-appointed lobby area. The balcony has horizontal metal railings with gaps that could be a concern for a crawling baby or toddler and would need child-proofing; the coffee table has sharp corners that should be padded. Excellent natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows, overall very clean and in great condition. Listed through UR HOUSE, a foreigner-friendly rental agency."}
