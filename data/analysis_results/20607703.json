{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with elegant finishes including recessed lighting, decorative ceiling molding, and polished tile floors. The unit features a spacious living room with leather sofa, multiple bedrooms including one with floral wall decals suitable for a nursery, and a study/office room with wood flooring. The floors are smooth and slippery which could be a concern for crawling babies; furniture has some sharp corners on coffee table and desk. Being on 6F of a 12F building strongly suggests elevator access."}
