{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with recently installed vinyl plank flooring but dated kitchen tiles, older wooden doors, and an aging wall-mounted AC unit. The unit is unfurnished, very spacious at 40 ping with multiple rooms, and reasonably clean. Being on the 3rd floor of a 4-story walkup (no elevator) is a concern for a pregnant woman and later carrying a stroller; the balcony has green corrugated panels and metal grille bars which are adequate for baby safety, but natural light appears limited due to those panels partially blocking windows."}
