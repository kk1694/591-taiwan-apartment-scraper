{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean polished tile floors, updated kitchen with stainless appliances, AC units, and neutral decor. The building exterior shows a mid-rise residential complex with landscaped courtyard suggesting elevator access. For baby safety: the space is open-plan with no visible stairs in the unit, floors are smooth but slippery, and there are some electrical outlets at low height that would need covers; windows appear secured with proper frames."}
