{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment with double-height ceiling, clean white finishes, and updated kitchen with gas stove. Major baby safety concern: open internal staircase with minimal railings leading to upper level - would require baby gates and careful supervision. Good natural light from large windows, appears clean and well-maintained."}
