{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, and solid wood furniture throughout. The unit has at least 2 bedrooms with good natural light from large windows, a kitchen with fridge and washing machine, and a balcony with horizontal metal railings visible in the living room photo — the railing gaps appear wide enough to be a concern for a crawling baby and should be inspected in person. The 10th floor location on a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access; the apartment is clean, spacious at 25 ping, and in good overall condition with no visible red flags beyond the balcony safety check."}
