{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment in fair condition with dated fixtures and mixed flooring types. Major baby safety concern: the staircase (3F in a 5F walk-up building without elevator) has widely-spaced spindle railings that a toddler could fit through, and the stairs themselves appear steep with no baby gate provisions. Rooms appear clean but have limited natural light due to frosted/security glass windows."}
