{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, wall-mounted AC units, and good natural light from sliding glass windows with metal railings on the balcony. The balcony has railings with gaps that could be a concern for a baby once mobile, and the unit is completely empty so would need full furnishing. At 47 ping on the 5th floor of a 9-story building (likely has elevator), this is a spacious multi-room layout suitable for a family, though the lack of any kitchen/bathroom photos and the very minimal listing description are minor red flags worth investigating."}
