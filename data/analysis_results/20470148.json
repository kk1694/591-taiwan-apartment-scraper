{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern renovation with designer fixtures, large TV wall with floating shelves, stylish globe chandelier, and at least 3 bedrooms including a master with en-suite bathroom. Excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows in bedrooms. For baby safety, the gold irregular-shaped coffee table in the living room has sharp edges that would need padding, and the bedroom balcony doors should be secured; window bars visible in the third bedroom are a plus for child safety. Very clean and well-maintained, managed by UR HOUSE (expat-friendly agency). At 38.49 ping this is spacious for a family, though the 3F walkup with no confirmed elevator could be inconvenient with a stroller."}
