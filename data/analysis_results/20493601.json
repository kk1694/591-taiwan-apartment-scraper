{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean minimalist interior, recessed lighting, large tile flooring, and a stylish leather sofa. The building has an elevator (clearly visible in lobby photo), underground parking garage with rolling shutters, and an upscale communal lounge/reading area with designer furniture. The living room appears spacious with good natural light from large curtained windows; smooth flat floors and minimal sharp corners are favorable for baby safety, though only one room is shown so kitchen/bedroom conditions are unknown. The listing description is essentially empty (just a 591 sales pitch), which is a minor red flag — request more interior photos and full layout details before committing."}
