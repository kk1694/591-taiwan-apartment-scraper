{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with new light-colored laminate flooring, recessed LED lighting, modern pendant lights in the hallway, and freshly painted walls. The spacious 42-ping layout has multiple rooms and a long corridor leading to a bathroom. The balcony has iron railings with wide gaps that would need baby-proofing, and exposed AC units and wiring on the balcony are a concern; being on the 3rd floor of a 5-floor walkup means no elevator, which is inconvenient with a stroller. Natural light appears limited as most photos show small windows, though the balcony side gets decent daylight."}
