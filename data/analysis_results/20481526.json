{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin hillside area, likely near Yangmingshan", "notes": "Very spacious luxury apartment (~84 ping) with hardwood floors and recessed lighting, but furnishings and finishes appear dated (older-style wooden room divider, aging curtains, glass coffee table with sharp corners). The large sliding glass balcony doors on the 7th floor are a major baby safety concern and would need childproofing; the glass coffee table corners are also hazardous. Excellent natural light from multiple large windows with green hillside views, and the unit is clean and well-maintained overall, though the description is essentially empty (just an agent advertisement), which is a minor red flag."}
