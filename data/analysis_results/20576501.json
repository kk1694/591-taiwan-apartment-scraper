{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with sleek white cabinetry, marble-pattern coffee table, glass kitchen backsplash, built-in microwave, and a high-end inverter washer/dryer on an enclosed balcony. The open-plan living area has smooth tile flooring with no stairs and rounded furniture edges, which is relatively baby-safe; the enclosed balcony with sliding glass door and half-height tiled wall provides good separation. Natural light appears moderate — windows are visible but the unit seems to face other buildings closely. At 22 ping for NT$62,000 in Zhongzheng this is reasonably priced for a modern unit, though the listing description is minimal (just a generic agent ad), which is a minor red flag — verify actual layout and room count in person."}
