{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a duplex/loft-style unit in an upscale Neihu community complex with well-maintained grounds, koi pond, and sculpture garden. The interior has dated wood paneling and hardwood floors from the 1990s-2000s era, with double-height ceilings and large windows providing excellent natural light. Major baby safety concern: the open staircase connecting the two levels has no gate and features sharp-edged geometric steps with minimal railing — this would require significant baby-proofing. Some wall discoloration/staining visible in the bedroom suggests possible moisture issues."}
