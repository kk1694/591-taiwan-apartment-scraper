{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern LED accent lighting, marble-look TV wall, wood-tone flooring, and stylish fixtures. Kitchen is compact but well-equipped with a large Panasonic fridge, washing machine, and cooktop. Bedroom has good natural light with wide windows and a padded headboard wall. For baby safety, the open kitchen doorway and low TV stand edges are minor concerns, but overall the flat layout with no stairs is favorable; no balcony is visible in the images which reduces fall risk."}
