{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "The listing description only contains a generic promotional message for real estate agents rather than actual property details. At 25 ping (82.5 sqm) in Xinyi District for NT$49,500/month, this is a reasonably sized apartment at a moderate price for the area. Without images or a detailed description, baby safety features (balcony railings, stairs, sharp corners), natural light, and overall condition cannot be assessed. The 2F/7F floor placement is convenient but elevator availability is unknown. The lack of substantive listing details is a minor red flag - recommend visiting in person."}
