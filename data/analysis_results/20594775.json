{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Donghua Building (東華大樓), near Taipei 101, Xinyi District", "notes": "Photos only show building exterior and common areas - no interior apartment photos provided. The building entrance shows '東華大樓' (Donghua Building) with a well-maintained marble lobby and multiple elevators. Located very close to Taipei 101 with tree-lined streets. Cannot assess apartment condition, baby safety features, or living space as no interior images were included. Red flag: listing lacks actual apartment photos, which is unusual for a NT$78,000/month rental."}
