{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with light wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, minimalist white fixtures, wall-mounted AC, and a spacious open-plan living/dining area. The space is very clean with no visible sharp corners or hazards; the flat layout with no stairs is excellent for baby safety. Good natural light from multiple windows in both living room and bedroom, and at 22.57 ping on the 6th floor of a 14-story building (very likely has elevator), this is a well-maintained, move-in ready unit managed by Miller House agency."}
