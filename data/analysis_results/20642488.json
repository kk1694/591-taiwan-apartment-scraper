{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Stylishly renovated apartment with modern track lighting, contemporary furniture, and clean finishes throughout. The living room and bedrooms are well-designed with good natural light; however, the kitchen area appears more utilitarian with exposed pipes and an older-style setup. For baby safety, the open wardrobe shelving and low window sills in some rooms may need childproofing, and the window grilles appear secure."}
