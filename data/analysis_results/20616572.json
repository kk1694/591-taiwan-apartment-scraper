{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Luxurious, well-renovated apartment with high-end finishes including marble accent walls, mirrored ceiling panels, recessed lighting, modern kitchen with large refrigerator and built-in oven, and hardwood flooring in bedrooms. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), suggesting it targets foreign tenants. For baby safety: the glass coffee tables and sharp-cornered furniture in the living room would need childproofing, and the tile floors in the living area are slippery; however the bedrooms have warm hardwood floors and large windows provide excellent natural light. At 38 ping on the 8th floor of a 12-story building, an elevator is almost certain, and the spacious layout offers plenty of room for a growing family."}
