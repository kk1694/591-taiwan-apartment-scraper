{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a ground-floor commercial or storefront space rather than a residential apartment. The main area has large sliding glass doors opening directly to the street, bare tile floors, fluorescent lighting, and no kitchen or bathroom fixtures visible. One back room has a bare concrete floor with stains and a small high window, suggesting storage use. Another room has laminate flooring but limited natural light facing an alley. The space is completely unfurnished and would require significant renovation for residential use. Not suitable for a family with a baby — the street-level glass storefront entrance, lack of residential fixtures, and raw back room are major red flags."}
