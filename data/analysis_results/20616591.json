{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including wood flooring, built-in storage, and clean white walls. The unit features large windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the open balcony visible in one image would need childproofing, and the hard tile flooring in some areas may need rugs. Overall appears clean and in good condition with a functional kitchen and bathroom."}
