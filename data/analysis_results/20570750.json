{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large unfurnished apartment with dated fixtures (older style light fixtures, traditional wooden wardrobes) but clean condition. Good natural light from multiple large windows with balcony access. Baby safety concerns include balcony with decorative iron railings that a child could climb, and visible stairs near balcony door area. The space is very open with tile flooring throughout which is easy to clean but hard if a baby falls."}
