{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment with new wood-look flooring, modern white kitchen with glass backsplash, gas stove, and updated bathroom with clean white tiles. The unit is very spacious at ~35 ping with good natural light from large windows with security grilles; the balcony has safety bars which is good for baby safety, though the bathroom has a wet-floor open shower design that could be slippery. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder), and the apartment being on 5F of an 8F older building with no confirmed elevator could be challenging with a stroller and baby."}
