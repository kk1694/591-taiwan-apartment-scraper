{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated dark wood furniture and traditional fixtures. The space is very large (51 ping) with clean tile floors but minimal natural light from small windows. For baby safety, the open floor plan is good but the older furniture has sharp corners; no visible balcony hazards in these images. The unit appears clean but unfurnished and somewhat dated."}
