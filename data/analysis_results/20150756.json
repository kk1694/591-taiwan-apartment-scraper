{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC units in every room, and contemporary furnishings. The unit has at least 3 rooms including a living room and two bedrooms, with a possible third room suitable as a nursery. Baby safety concerns include floor-to-ceiling balcony doors with metal railings in the living room and bedrooms, and an open industrial-style shelving unit with sharp metal frames in the master bedroom. Good natural light from large windows in all rooms; the 8th floor in a 15-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
