{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious, modern apartment with excellent natural light from large windows. The unit features contemporary fixtures including a clean kitchen with white cabinetry, modern bathroom with glass shower enclosure, and what appears to be wood-look flooring throughout. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass panels which is good, though the open staircase to the loft area and the loft's open railing would require childproofing. The space is clean and well-maintained with a bright, airy feel."}
