{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang", "notes": "Modern, unfurnished apartment in a well-maintained 14-story building with commercial shops at ground level. The unit features polished tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in ceiling AC, large floor-to-ceiling windows with good natural light, and two clean bathrooms with glass-enclosed shower areas. Being unfurnished and on the 13th floor with no visible balcony access, it is relatively baby-safe, though the slippery polished tile floors and glass shower partitions would need attention; the unit appears very clean and move-in ready but will require purchasing all furniture and appliances."}
