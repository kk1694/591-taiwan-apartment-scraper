{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a duplex/loft-style apartment with interior stairs, which is a significant baby safety concern - the ornate wrought iron railings have wide gaps that a child could slip through or get stuck in. The apartment appears clean and modern with good natural light from multiple windows, split AC units, and tile flooring throughout. The building is 13 floors tall (unit on 5F), strongly suggesting elevator access."}
