{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious unfurnished apartment (60.5 ping) on 12F of a 17-story building in Da'an district with marble floors in the living area and hardwood in bedrooms. The unit is clean but dated — the bathroom has older white tile, a bathtub with shower curtain, and yellowing fixtures. Natural light is excellent with multiple large windows in every room. For baby safety, the marble floors are very slippery and hard (risk of injury from falls), the bathtub lacks a proper enclosure, and some windows appear to have accessible balcony railings that would need childproofing. The apartment is listed through a Japanese real estate agency (Okumura) and the listing description is essentially just an ad placeholder with no real details about the unit."}
