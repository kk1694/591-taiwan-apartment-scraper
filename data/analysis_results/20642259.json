{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment on the top floor (5F/5F) in Da'an district, completely unfurnished with dated tile flooring, basic light fixtures, and an older-style gas stove. The unit is spacious at ~38 ping with multiple rooms and decent natural light from large windows, but shows its age with yellowed ceilings and dark wood baseboards. Being on the top floor with no elevator information is a concern for a pregnant woman carrying groceries/stroller; the hard tile floors throughout and lack of any furnishings mean significant setup cost, but the open layout has few sharp corners and no visible balcony hazards in the photos."}
