{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment with recessed lighting, open-plan living/kitchen with breakfast bar, and contemporary furnishings. Being on floor 3 of 15 in a newer building strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the glass balcony doors and hard tile floors throughout are considerations; the bar stools are unstable for climbing toddlers. Good natural light from large sliding doors to balcony."}
