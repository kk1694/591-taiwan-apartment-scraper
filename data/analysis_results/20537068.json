{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern apartment with sleek minimalist design, herringbone wood flooring, recessed lighting, and modern white kitchen with built-in appliances. The open-plan layout with glass partitions is very clean but the low furniture edges and glass panels may need baby-proofing. Large windows provide excellent natural light and the space appears well-maintained. The 10-story building at floor 3 likely has an elevator."}
