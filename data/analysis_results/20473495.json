{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean modern apartment with white glossy tile floors, updated white kitchen cabinetry with built-in appliances and range hood. Good natural light through large floor-to-ceiling windows with security grilles. For baby safety, the glass-top coffee table has metal edges that could be a concern, but the space is generally open with minimal sharp corners. Being on 15F of a 15-floor building, an elevator is almost certain."}
