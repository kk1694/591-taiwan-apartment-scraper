{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Modern, recently renovated apartment with very high ceilings (appears to be a loft/duplex style), clean white walls, polished tile flooring, and track lighting. The unit is unfurnished with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the high ceilings suggest there may be a mezzanine or loft level with stairs that would need childproofing; the slippery polished tile floors could also be a concern for a crawling baby. Overall the unit appears clean and well-maintained, listed through UR HOUSE rental management agency."}
