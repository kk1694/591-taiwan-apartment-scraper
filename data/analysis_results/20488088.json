{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with designer finishes, stylish lighting, and high-end kitchen. Major baby safety concerns: the unit has internal stairs leading to a loft area with a steep ladder-style staircase lacking safety gates, which is dangerous for crawling babies and toddlers. The unit appears clean with good natural light through large windows, but the multi-level design with exposed stairs requires significant childproofing."}
