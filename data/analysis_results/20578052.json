{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated unfurnished apartment with clean white walls, polished tile floors, recessed lighting, and wall-mounted AC units. The unit appears to be on a high floor (12F) in a building that likely has an elevator. For baby safety, the balcony has floor-to-ceiling railings which is good, but the completely unfurnished state means you would need to add all furniture and baby-proof corners yourself. Good natural light from windows and balcony."}
