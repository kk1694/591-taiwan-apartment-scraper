{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean white finishes, built-in wooden cabinetry, and contemporary fixtures including a wall-mounted TV and modern kitchen appliances. The space is single-level with no stairs, but the small balcony visible through floor-to-ceiling windows may need baby-proofing. Good natural light from the balcony side; overall very clean and baby-safe with smooth surfaces and minimal sharp corners."}
