{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in wardrobes, and a spacious dining/living area. At least two bedrooms visible with large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. The tile floors are slippery which could be a concern for a toddler, and the balcony areas with glass doors should be checked for secure locks; the glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing. Overall a clean, high-quality unit suitable for a family at 42 ping, and the 13-story building on floor 4 very likely has an elevator."}
