{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures and traditional wooden furniture. The unit is clean but shows signs of age with older-style wooden beds and window bars. Being on 4F/4F (top floor) without confirmed elevator could be challenging for a pregnant woman, and the traditional wooden bed frames have some sharp corners that would need baby-proofing. Windows have security bars which improve safety but limit natural light somewhat."}
