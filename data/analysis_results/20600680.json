{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment in excellent condition with recessed lighting, video intercom, clean white tile floors, and contemporary finishes. Good natural light from large windows on high floor (14F). For baby safety: no visible stairs or sharp corners, floor-to-ceiling windows appear secured, but the slippery tile floors may need rugs once baby is mobile. Kitchen is compact but functional with modern appliances."}
