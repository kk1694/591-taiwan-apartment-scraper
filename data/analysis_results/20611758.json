{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment in a high-rise building (7F/21F) with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, split AC, and a digital door lock. The bedrooms only have single beds and small desks, suggesting this may be set up as a shared/roommate apartment rather than a family unit — a major concern for a couple with a baby. Natural light appears limited as no windows are visible in the photos; the rooms look quite enclosed. The flat surfaces and lack of stairs are baby-safe, but the sparse furnishing and single-bed setup would need significant changes for family living."}
