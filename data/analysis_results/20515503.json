{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with renovated interior, quality furniture including leather recliner and sectional sofa. Kitchen has updated white cabinetry and built-in appliances. Balcony has solid waist-high railings which is good for baby safety, though the raised tatami-style bedroom platform has sharp edges to consider. Nice green courtyard view with good natural light from balcony and windows."}
