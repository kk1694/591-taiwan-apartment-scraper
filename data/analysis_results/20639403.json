{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei SongShan Hospital (台北松山醫院)", "notes": "Modern upscale 12-story residential building in Songshan with a gated entrance, security cameras, and well-maintained common areas. Interior has light wood-tone laminate flooring, recessed LED lighting, built-in wooden cabinetry, and sliding glass doors leading to a balcony — the balcony has glass/metal railings that would need baby-proofing. The living area is spacious at ~45 ping with clean, bright finishes, though the interior photos show somewhat limited natural light; the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding for a crawling baby. Located directly adjacent to Taipei SongShan Hospital, which is very convenient for prenatal care and emergencies."}
