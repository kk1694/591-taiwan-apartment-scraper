{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with dated decor including decorative backlit ceiling panels and basic furniture. The unit appears clean but has an outdated aesthetic. For a baby, the glass coffee table with sharp corners and exposed electrical outlets are concerns; however, the floors are smooth and flat. Limited natural light visible through security-barred windows, with windows appearing to face an enclosed balcony or corridor area."}
