{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-renovated apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, built-in wood-panel TV wall, updated white kitchen with built-in oven and large refrigerator, and a clean bathroom with bathtub. The living area is very open with polished tile floors and good natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and open layout are generally good, but the bathtub will need supervision; no visible balcony hazards or dangerous stairs in the photos, though the intercom and low window in the living room may need childproofing."}
