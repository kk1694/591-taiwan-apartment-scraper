{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with recessed lighting, clean tile flooring, built-in wood cabinetry, and an open-plan kitchen with modern dark cabinets and stone countertops. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at 39 ping, with decent natural light from multiple windows. For baby safety, the low kitchen counter partition has rounded corners which is good, but the open kitchen layout means access to the stove/gas range would need to be gated; no stairs or dangerous balcony railings are visible in the photos."}
