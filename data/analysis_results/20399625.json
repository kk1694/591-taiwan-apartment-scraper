{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-maintained studio apartment with contemporary finishes including recessed lighting, built-in wardrobes, and a clean white kitchen with induction cooktop. The bathroom features a bathtub with natural light. Baby safety concern: the balcony has glass railings that appear lower than ideal and gaps that could be hazardous for a crawling/toddling child - would need baby gates or supervision. Being on 12F of a 12-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
