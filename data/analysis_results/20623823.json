{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious and clean apartment with modern white tile flooring, updated kitchen with white cabinetry, gas stove, and full-size refrigerator. The living room is bright with large windows providing good natural light, and the bedroom has two windows with curtains. The glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners which is a baby safety concern, and the tile floors are very slick which could be hazardous for a crawling/toddling child. At 38.4 ping this is a generously sized unit with open-plan living/dining area, well-suited for a growing family. No elevator info is visible but the 3rd floor walkup in a 9-floor building likely has one."}
