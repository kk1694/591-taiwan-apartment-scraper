{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including light wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, and contemporary kitchen with white cabinets and gas stove. The space appears safe for a baby with no visible stairs or dangerous balconies; all rooms are on one level with smooth floors. Limited natural light visible as curtains are drawn; the decorative entry door with iron scrollwork suggests an older building despite the updated interior."}
