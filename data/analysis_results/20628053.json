{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, decorative crown molding, new white tile flooring, and updated kitchen with white cabinetry. Very clean and spacious at 50 ping. For baby safety: the hard tile floors throughout may need rugs, and the balcony area off the kitchen should be assessed for railing height. Good natural light from multiple windows with curtains. No visible stairs (single-level unit)."}
