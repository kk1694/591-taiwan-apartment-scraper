{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern European-style decor, recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors in living areas and hardwood in bedroom. The space is clean with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety: the coffee table has glass top with sharp corners, and balcony access should be checked; otherwise the open floor plan with smooth floors is relatively safe for crawling."}
