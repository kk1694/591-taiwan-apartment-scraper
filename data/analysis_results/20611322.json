{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Modern renovated apartment with clean white walls, light wood-look flooring, wall-mounted TV, built-in wardrobes, split AC, and a well-equipped kitchen with green cabinetry, built-in oven, and range hood. At 6F/15F the building very likely has an elevator. The unit appears to have a separate bedroom, living area with sofa and desk, and a kitchen with a window for natural light. For baby safety, the balcony area visible in image 1 with a washing machine would need a gate or barrier; the open floor plan and lack of stairs are positives. Moving boxes from the current tenant suggest it will be vacated soon. Overall a clean, modern space suitable for a small family, though at ~17 ping it may feel tight with a baby's gear."}
