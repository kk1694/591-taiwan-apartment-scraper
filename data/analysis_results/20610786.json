{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "This is a well-renovated duplex/loft apartment with upscale modern finishes including marble-look accent walls, crystal chandelier, open kitchen with gas stove and bar seating, and glossy tile floors throughout. The unit is on the 11th floor of a 12-story building (very likely has elevator) and has good natural light from a balcony with floor-to-ceiling sliding glass door. Baby safety concerns include an internal staircase (visible in image 1) connecting two levels which would need gating, sharp-edged marble counters and bar stools, and the balcony access; the overall condition is clean and move-in ready, managed by Dingli Rental Service agency."}
