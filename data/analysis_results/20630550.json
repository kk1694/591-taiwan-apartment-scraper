{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan North Road Section 1, Lane 33 (中山北路一段33巷), Beautiful Living Mansion (美麗行館), near Zhongshan MRT / Shantao Temple MRT / Taiwan Railway Station", "notes": "2BR/2BA apartment on 7F/11F with elevator, high 3.6m ceilings, dual balconies, and dual mezzanine lofts. The mezzanine lofts are a baby safety concern — stairs/ladders to lofts and elevated open areas pose serious fall risks for a crawling baby or toddler; the dual balconies also need childproof railing checks. Described as simple furnishing 3+ years old, so condition is likely adequate but not freshly renovated; one unit per floor provides good privacy and the central Zhongshan location has excellent transit access."}
