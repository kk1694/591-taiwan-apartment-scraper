{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, built-in AC, and contemporary tile flooring. The open floor plan with smooth tile floors is baby-friendly with no visible stairs or sharp corners, though the heavy marble coffee table may need padding. Natural light appears limited based on closed curtains, but the space is clean and bright with ample room for a family."}
