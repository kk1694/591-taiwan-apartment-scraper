{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment with high-end finishes including recessed lighting, wood-grain flooring, and built-in cabinetry. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light with views of greenery. For baby safety, the sliding glass doors to the balcony need childproofing and some sharp corners on built-in furniture should be padded. The building exterior shows a well-maintained high-rise complex with landscaped grounds, and being on floor 3 of 11 strongly suggests elevator access."}
