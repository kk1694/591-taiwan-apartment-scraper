{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is clearly a commercial office space, NOT a residential apartment. The images show large open-plan rooms with drop ceiling tiles, fluorescent panel lighting, and a bulletin board (公布欄) on a glass partition wall — all hallmarks of an office. The space is completely empty with no kitchen, bathroom fixtures, or residential amenities visible. Being on the 12th/top floor of an older building with no visible residential features, this is entirely unsuitable for a family with a baby and should be skipped."}
