{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, newly renovated apartment with modern finishes including track lighting, wood-look flooring, glass sliding doors, and multiple AC units. Excellent natural light from large windows and balcony access. For baby safety, the balcony has railings but would need child-proofing; the glass partition doors have accessible handles, and open floor plan has minimal sharp corners which is favorable."}
