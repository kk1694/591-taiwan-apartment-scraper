{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Spacious 54-ping apartment with traditional/older-style furnishings including heavy wooden furniture, terrazzo flooring, and a chandelier — clean but dated, not modern. The living room is very large with a balcony visible through windows with security grilles; the balcony railing and window grilles appear sturdy which is good for baby safety, but the glass-topped coffee table with sharp corners and hard terrazzo floors are concerns for a crawling baby. Good natural light from multiple windows in all rooms; the apartment is clean and well-maintained but the overall style and fixtures suggest a building from the 1990s or earlier."}
