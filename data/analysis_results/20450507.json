{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a clean but dated apartment from the 1990s-2000s with older tile floors and built-in cabinetry. The spacious living room has large balcony windows providing good natural light; balcony railings appear adequate but verify height. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and one bedroom has heavy dark wood furniture with protruding edges to watch for."}
