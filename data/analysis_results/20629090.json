{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in very clean, well-renovated condition with recessed lighting, split AC units in every room, white marble-look flooring, and quality furnishings including leather sofa and Dyson fan. Kitchen has full cabinetry, dining area, and appliances; bathroom features a freestanding soaking tub, modern toilet, and vanity. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the bathtub area lacks a non-slip mat; however, the flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus. Good natural light from large double windows in the living room, though the bedroom appears to lack windows and may feel enclosed."}
