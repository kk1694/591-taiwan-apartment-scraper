{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Wanhua District", "notes": "This listing at 19 ping on the 15th floor of an 18-story building in Wanhua District appears to be a residential apartment. The high floor in a tall building strongly suggests elevator access. The description is minimal (only a broker advertisement for a sales package at 240 NTD), providing no details about condition, layout, or amenities. At NT$41,500/month for 19 ping in Wanhua, the price is moderate. Without images or a detailed description, baby safety features (balcony railings, sharp corners, stairs) and natural light cannot be assessed. The lack of substantive listing details is a minor red flag — recommend visiting in person before committing."}
