{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District, near elevated highway/expressway", "notes": "Modern high-rise building with sleek grey/black facade, clean interior with wood-look flooring, modern kitchenette with glass backsplash, and furnished bedroom with wall-mounted TV. The apartment is clean and well-maintained with modern dark-tone cabinetry and doors. For baby safety, the unit appears to be a flat single-level layout with no stairs; windows have blinds but natural light seems limited due to facing an adjacent building closely. A potential concern is the building's proximity to an elevated highway/expressway visible in photo 1, which could mean traffic noise — worth checking noise levels, especially for a baby's sleep. Exposed ceiling pipes in the entryway area suggest a slightly industrial finish in that section. The sign on the adjacent building reads 佳天建設."}
