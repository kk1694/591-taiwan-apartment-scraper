{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated ceramic tile flooring, window-unit AC, and basic light fixtures throughout. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at 36.2 ping but shows its age with dark baseboards showing wear and older-style frosted glass windows. For a couple with a baby, the hard tile floors could be a concern for crawling/falls, and the window-unit ACs are less efficient and noisier than split units; however, the flat open layout with no visible stairs or sharp corners is relatively baby-safe. Natural light appears limited based on the frosted/barred windows."}
