{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Yangmingshan/Shilin mountainside", "notes": "Luxury modern apartment with high-end marble flooring, floor-to-ceiling windows, and excellent natural light with mountain views. The spacious open layout is very clean but the balcony with metal railings and large sliding glass doors would need baby gates installed. The decorative hexagonal shelving unit has sharp corners that pose a risk for a crawling baby. Overall excellent condition but at 2F with no elevator info visible."}
