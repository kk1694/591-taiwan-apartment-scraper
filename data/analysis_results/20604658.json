{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious unfurnished apartment (~30 ping) with newly laid light-colored laminate flooring and freshly painted white walls, but older-style wooden cabinetry and glass-fronted wall units suggest a renovated older building rather than a truly modern unit. The open layout with large floor-to-ceiling windows provides good natural light; the space appears clean and has AC units, a wardrobe, and built-in storage. For baby safety, the large windows with a balcony area behind them need childproofing, and the mostly empty open-plan layout is actually favorable with few sharp corners, though the listing description is suspiciously minimal (just a generic agent ad with no real details), which is a red flag worth investigating further."}
