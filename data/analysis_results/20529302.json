{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated empty apartment with new wood-laminate flooring throughout, freshly painted white walls, and wall-mounted AC units in multiple rooms. The unit is spacious at 36.69 ping with at least 3 rooms plus a hallway, kitchen, and bathroom — good for a growing family. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is a plus, but the kitchen has an older tile finish and the bathroom appears basic; no balcony railings are visible so that risk is unclear. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder), which is a minor red flag — verify room count, lease terms, and whether the building has an elevator since it is on the 3rd floor of a 10-story building."}
