{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern newly renovated apartment with clean white walls, updated kitchen with built-in oven and gas stove, and wood-look flooring (currently protected with cardboard during move-in/renovation). The unit has a balcony with floor-to-ceiling glass doors with dark frames. For baby safety, the balcony railings appear to have narrow vertical bars which is good, but the glass balcony doors would need child locks. The space is unfurnished and appears very clean with good natural light from the balcony. Building appears modern with elevator visible in hallway photos."}
