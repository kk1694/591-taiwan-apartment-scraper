{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment with clean minimalist design, recessed lighting, new AC unit, and contemporary fixtures. The unit is a single open space combining living, sleeping, and kitchen areas with a balcony accessible through floor-to-ceiling windows with metal railings. Building has a gym amenity suggesting a newer development with elevator. Baby safety concerns include the balcony access and low coffee table with sharp corners; the open layout and smooth floors are generally safe but space is limited for a growing family."}
