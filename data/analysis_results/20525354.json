{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in very clean, modern condition with new furniture (still in plastic wrapping), recessed LED lighting, split AC units, and large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. The large windows in both the living room and bedroom are a baby safety concern as they extend low to the floor and would need child-proof locks or guards; the open-plan layout with smooth tile flooring is otherwise baby-friendly with no stairs or sharp corners visible. At 13 ping on the 8th floor of a 13-story building (likely has elevator), the space appears clean but compact for a couple with a baby, and the listing description is minimal/boilerplate from a real estate agent (Sung-Hsin), which is a minor red flag suggesting limited detail about lease terms."}
