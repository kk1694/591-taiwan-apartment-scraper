{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District, near MRT station", "notes": "Spacious 3BR/2BA full-floor residential unit with elevator access, furnished and move-in ready. Amenities include AC, fridge, washer, gas stove (cooking allowed), balcony, and internet - good for family living. Near MRT which is convenient. Balcony presence warrants checking railing height/gaps for baby safety. No pets allowed. At NT$50,000 plus NT$1,000 management fee with 2-month deposit, this is reasonably priced for Da'an. Cannot confirm modern condition without seeing the 13 listing photos in person, but the furnished ready-to-move-in status and full amenity list suggest decent condition."}
