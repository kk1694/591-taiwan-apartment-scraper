{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including ceiling fans, vintage wooden furniture, and an outdated kitchen with white tile walls and older appliances. Being on 6F/6F without visible elevator, this could be a walk-up concern for a family with a baby. The apartment is spacious with a large living room but has poor natural light in the dining area, and the glass coffee table and low-lying decorative items pose baby safety concerns."}
