{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious top-floor (7F/7F) apartment with dated decor featuring faux stone brick walls, old-style wooden cabinetry, decorative ceiling panels, and an internal staircase leading to what appears to be a rooftop addition. The unit is unfurnished with tile flooring in the main area and dark hardwood in the bedroom. Major baby safety concerns include the open staircase with low railings and no gate, plus being on the top floor means potential heat issues in summer and no elevator confirmation. Good natural light from large windows, but the overall style is 1990s Taiwanese and would need significant updating."}
