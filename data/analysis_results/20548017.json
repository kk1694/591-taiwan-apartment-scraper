{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with sleek black-framed glass partitions, recessed LED lighting, concealed ducted AC, and clean white tile floors throughout. The living room is spacious with contemporary furniture; there are at least two bedrooms including a small study/nursery room with a platform bed and desk. For baby safety, the glass partition doors between the living room and kitchen/dining area have no sharp edges but the coffee tables have metal legs with hard corners that would need padding; no balcony or dangerous railings visible. The apartment is very clean and well-lit, suitable for a family, though the single bed in the bedroom may need upgrading for a couple."}
