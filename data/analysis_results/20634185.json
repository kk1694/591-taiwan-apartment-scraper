{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with high-end finishes including marble-effect floor tiles, recessed LED ceiling lighting, marble accent wall in living room, split AC units, and a video intercom system. The unit is unfurnished and in pristine condition with spacious rooms. For baby safety, the hard tile floors throughout could be a concern for crawling/falls, and the balcony sliding doors should be secured; however, no visible stairs, sharp corners are minimal, and the overall layout is flat and open. Being on the 1st floor of 7 is convenient with a stroller but the description is minimal (agent listing boilerplate only), so kitchen, bathroom, and full layout details are unknown."}
