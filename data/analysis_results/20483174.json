{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern recessed/cove lighting, clean tile floors, and contemporary fixtures including wall-mounted AC units. The balcony has decorative iron railings which could be a safety concern for a crawling baby - would need baby-proofing. Excellent natural light from large sliding glass doors. No visible stairs or sharp corners in main living areas, making it relatively baby-safe with minimal modifications needed."}
