{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including light wood-tone vinyl flooring, recessed LED lighting, sleek white kitchen cabinetry with induction cooktop, and sliding barn-style doors. The unit appears to be a loft-style layout with a raised sleeping area that has low ceiling clearance and balcony access with decorative frosted glass railings. For baby safety, the balcony railing gaps visible through the frosted glass panels and the loft-style bedroom with potential step-downs are concerns; the open kitchen layout also means the cooktop is accessible. Natural light is moderate from floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors on the 2nd floor, and the apartment is clean and in good condition overall."}
