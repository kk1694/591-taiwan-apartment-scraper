{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern apartment with contemporary minimalist design, track lighting, new split AC units, and modern kitchen with gas stove and full-size refrigerator. Clean condition with light wood-tone flooring throughout. Baby safety considerations: no visible balcony hazards in photos, furniture has some sharp corners on metal side tables, but overall layout is relatively open and safe. Natural light appears limited as all windows shown are covered by floor-to-ceiling curtains."}
