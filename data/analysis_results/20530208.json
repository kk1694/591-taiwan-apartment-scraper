{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment on 18F with excellent mountain views, recessed LED lighting, split AC, and updated bathrooms with glass-enclosed showers. Kitchen is clean with modern white cabinets and gas stove. For baby safety: the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bathroom and living area should be assessed for secure latches; the coffee table has rounded edges which is good; however the glass shower enclosures and low balcony railings visible from the view photo warrant caution."}
