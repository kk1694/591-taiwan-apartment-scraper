{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious and modern apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed LED ceiling lighting, and contemporary furnishings including a large sofa set, TV console, and open shelving. The unit at 48 ping is very large with multiple rooms and good natural light from several windows with curtains. For baby safety, the hard tile floors and sharp-cornered coffee table and metal shelving would need padding; no visible balcony railings or stairs in photos, and the flat single-level layout is good. Being on the 10th floor of a 13-story building strongly suggests elevator access. Listed via Sung-Hsin Real Estate agent; the description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request a viewing to verify full condition including kitchen and bathroom."}
