{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment on the top floor (5F/5F) with dark green marble tile flooring throughout and dated kitchen with pink cabinetry. The unit is clean and unfurnished except for the master bedroom which has a bed and vanity. Good natural light from multiple windows and a balcony with sliding doors. Baby safety concerns include the very slippery polished marble floors, the open balcony access, and being on the top floor of a walkup (no elevator confirmed) which would be difficult with a stroller. The kitchen and fixtures are functional but dated, suggesting this is a 1990s-era building."}
