{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, modern high-rise apartment with excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows on multiple sides. Clean hardwood floors, contemporary furnishings, and central air conditioning throughout. The open floor plan has minimal stairs but the glass coffee table has sharp corners and the balcony sliding doors would need baby-proofing; overall very suitable for a family with good condition and no red flags."}
