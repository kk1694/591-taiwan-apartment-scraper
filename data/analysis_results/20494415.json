{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end apartment in a newer 11-story building with elevator, marble lobby floors, digital door locks, and central air conditioning. The interior is clean and minimally furnished with tile floors, a small open kitchen with gas stove and range hood, and recessed ceiling lighting. For baby safety, the unit appears to be a single-level flat with no stairs; the open kitchen lacks a barrier which could be a concern for a crawling baby, and the balcony railing height/style should be verified in person. The apartment is mostly unfurnished so furniture with rounded corners could be chosen, but at ~41 sqm it may feel tight for a growing family."}
