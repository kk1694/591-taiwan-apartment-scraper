{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu, near Caihong Bridge (Rainbow Bridge) along Keelung River", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained upscale apartment on 11F with hardwood floors, recessed lighting, crown molding, leather sofa set, built-in cabinetry, and a modern open kitchen/dining area. Large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors lead to a balcony with good natural light and city views. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the balcony access via sliding doors should be secured with a child lock; the balcony railing appears to be a solid wall-height barrier which is positive. The nearby Rainbow Bridge and Keelung River riverside park shown in photo 3 suggest a pleasant neighborhood with walking paths, though the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and included appliances."}
