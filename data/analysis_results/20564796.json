{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment on 13F with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, ceiling-mounted AC, and contemporary black-trim doors. The unit appears spacious at 44 ping and is in very clean, move-in ready condition with minimal furnishing (covered sofas, glass coffee table). For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings visible through floor-to-ceiling windows which will need childproofing, and the glass coffee table has sharp corners that pose a risk; however the flat single-level layout with no stairs is ideal. Good natural light from large windows in both the living room and bedroom, though views face neighboring buildings. Note: the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout, kitchen, and bathroom before committing."}
