{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "No. 83 (building number visible), near 7-Eleven", "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with minimalist design, light wood flooring, and clean white walls. The building is a tall 13-story structure with elevator access and a proper lobby with security door. Good for baby safety - no visible stairs inside, smooth rounded furniture, recessed lighting. Limited natural light visible in photos but recessed LED lighting throughout. The building entrance shows address #83 and there's a 7-Eleven at street level for convenience."}
