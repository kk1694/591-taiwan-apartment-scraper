{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean studio apartment with all-white cabinetry, murphy bed, washer/dryer combo, mini fridge, microwave, induction cooktop, and small sink kitchenette. Very compact open-plan layout at 11 ping — too small for a couple with a baby as there is no separate bedroom, no room for a crib, and exposed pipes on the ceiling. The slick tile floors could be slippery for a crawling baby, and the murphy bed mechanism poses a pinch hazard. Natural light appears limited with dark window treatments; no balcony visible. Overpriced at NT$48,000 for a studio this size."}
