{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean apartment in a high-rise building (13F/14F) in Da'an district with recessed LED lighting, light wood laminate flooring, and built-in wardrobes. The unit appears spacious at 18 ping with at least two bedrooms, large windows providing good natural light, and an AC unit. For baby safety, the wooden bench sofa has slatted openings that could trap small fingers, and the bed frames have sharp wooden corners that would need padding; however, the flat layout with no visible stairs is a plus. Listed via Sung-Hsin Real Estate agency; the description is minimal (just a promotional ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on kitchen/bathroom condition and balcony access."}
