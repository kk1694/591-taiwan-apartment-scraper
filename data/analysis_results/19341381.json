{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, minimalist modern apartment with new fixtures, light wood flooring, wall-mounted AC, and modern furniture. The unit appears bright with large windows in the bedroom showing a city view. Being on the 7th floor (top floor) of an older building likely means no elevator. For baby safety, the furniture has mostly rounded edges, but the low coffee table and TV could be concerns; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings."}
