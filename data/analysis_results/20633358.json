{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "Modern duplex/loft-style apartment with clean finishes, new furniture, and good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Major baby safety concern: this is a split-level unit with internal stairs that have only a minimal handrail - a crawling/walking toddler would need constant supervision or gates installed. The balcony has metal railings visible through the windows that appear reasonably safe."}
