{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/office space rather than a residential apartment — it features fluorescent grid ceiling lights, large open-plan rooms with no kitchen or residential fixtures visible, and tile/parquet flooring typical of offices. The building is an older walkup (3F/5F with visible staircase and no elevator). For a couple with a baby, this space has significant concerns: the staircase visible through the front door has metal railings a child could slip through, the space is completely unfurnished and would need full renovation, walls show staining and the ceiling has exposed wiring and missing panels suggesting deferred maintenance. Natural light is decent from the large sliding glass doors but the description is essentially just an ad for the agent's services with no real property details, which is a red flag."}
