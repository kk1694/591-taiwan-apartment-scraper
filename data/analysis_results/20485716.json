{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern apartment in excellent condition with clean white tile floors, recessed LED lighting, built-in wooden cabinetry, split AC units, and an intercom system. The unit is unfurnished with generous natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows; the balcony has proper railings but sliding door access would need baby-proofing. At 42 ping on the 11th floor of a 17-story building (elevator very likely), this is a well-maintained, baby-friendly space with no visible sharp corners or stairs, though the hard tile floors may warrant play mats. Listed via UR HOUSE (foreigner-friendly agency)."}
