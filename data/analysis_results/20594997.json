{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and stylish studio/1-room apartment with high-end built-in cabinetry, Murphy bed, designer pendant lights, recessed AC, and wood laminate flooring throughout. The space is narrow but well-designed with floor-to-ceiling windows providing decent natural light. Baby safety concerns include a ladder to a loft/storage area, the fold-down Murphy bed mechanism, and the generally compact layout which limits crawling space; no visible balcony railings to worry about but the space may feel cramped for a growing family. Clean, move-in ready condition with no red flags, though 14 ping is quite small for a couple with a baby."}
