{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern studio apartment with excellent finishes including built-in appliances, hardwood floors, and hotel-style bathroom with bathtub and washer/dryer. The building appears to be a luxury high-rise with landscaped rooftop garden amenities. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp corners and the bathtub lacks safety features, but overall the open floor plan is manageable. Good natural light from windows with blinds."}
