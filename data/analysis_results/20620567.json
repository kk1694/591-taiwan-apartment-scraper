{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "High-end modern renovation with designer furniture, LED ambient lighting, built-in AC, and sleek minimalist finishes. Excellent cleanliness and condition. For baby safety, the space has rounded furniture edges and no visible stairs or dangerous balconies, though the small coffee table could be a concern for a crawling baby. Natural light appears limited based on visible windows, but artificial lighting is well designed."}
