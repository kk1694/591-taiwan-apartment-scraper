{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style apartment with wood flooring and dated fixtures. Kitchen has traditional gas stove and older cabinets. Windows have security bars which provide safety but may affect light. Being on 5F/5F with no visible elevator info is a concern for a family with a baby. The unit appears clean with decent natural light, and the hardwood floors are baby-friendly, but the overall style is dated rather than modern."}
