{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-finished apartment in a newer high-rise building (3F/19F strongly suggests elevator). The living area features clean wood-tone finishes, modern kitchen with subway tile backsplash, recessed lighting, and AC units. The bathroom is high-end with a soaking bathtub, glass-enclosed wet area, floating vanity, and bidet toilet. For baby safety, the balcony has metal railings with narrow spacing which is good, but the sliding glass doors to the balcony should be secured; the floor-to-ceiling bedroom window may also need a child lock. Overall spacious at 30.6 ping with good natural light, very clean condition, and no red flags — a strong option for a family with a baby."}
