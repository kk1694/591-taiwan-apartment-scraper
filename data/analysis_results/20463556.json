{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Near Taipei 101, Da'an District", "notes": "This is a spacious but dated apartment with 1990s-style marble floors, decorative glass partitions, and wood paneling. The unit appears clean but fixtures and design are outdated. For baby safety: the hard marble floors could be slippery and unforgiving for falls, and the glass display cabinets have sharp edges. The view shows Taipei 101 and greenery, suggesting good natural light and prime location near a park. Building is 11 floors, likely has elevator."}
