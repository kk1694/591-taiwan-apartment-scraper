{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Stylishly renovated 1F apartment with a rustic/industrial aesthetic featuring exposed wooden beam ceilings, warm orange walls, dark wood furniture, and terra cotta tile floors. The kitchen has gas stove and decent cabinetry, and the dining area is spacious. Being on the 1st floor eliminates stair/elevator concerns but may reduce natural light (windows have wooden blinds); the coffee table has sharp metal corners and open shelving with decorative items could pose baby safety risks. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad blurb), which is a minor red flag, and the heavily styled photos suggest it may be marketed more as a short-term/Airbnb-style rental at a premium price of NT$95,000 for 28 ping."}
