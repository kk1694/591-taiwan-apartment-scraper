{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio with loft design, high-end finishes, built-in furniture, and digital door lock. MAJOR baby safety concern: the unit has a steep metal ladder to access the loft/mezzanine level with open railings - extremely dangerous for a crawling baby or toddler. The space is compact but well-designed with good natural light from balcony; however, the loft configuration makes this unsuitable for a family with a baby."}
