{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated wooden flooring showing visible wear and uneven color. Windows have security grilles which are good for safety but the apartment appears somewhat dated with older AC units and basic fixtures. For baby safety, the hardwood floors are smooth but showing signs of age; windows have metal grilles preventing fall risk. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) without visible elevator info is a concern for carrying stroller and baby items."}
