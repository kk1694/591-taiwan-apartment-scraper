{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Modern, clean apartment in good condition with bright tile floors, L-shaped sofa, TV console, dining table, AC, and decent natural light from large windows. The living space appears well-maintained in a newer building (9-floor building on 2F strongly suggests elevator access). For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding, and the glass-topped dining table is a concern; no balcony or stairs are visible in these photos, which is positive. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), so layout details and kitchen/bathroom condition are unknown."}
