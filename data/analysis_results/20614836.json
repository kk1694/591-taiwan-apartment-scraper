{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very stylish, high-end modern apartment with sleek black-and-white interior design, glass partition walls separating the bedroom from the living area, open kitchen with clean white cabinetry, recessed lighting, and quality furnishings including a large leather sofa and dining set. For baby safety, the glass partition has metal frames with sharp edges at lower heights, the marble TV ledge has hard corners, and there are no visible balcony railings or stairs. Natural light appears decent through large curtained windows. The listing description is minimal (just an ad for agent services), which is a minor red flag — no details about lease terms, included utilities, or building amenities. Managed by UR HOUSE, a rental agency catering to foreigners, which may ease communication but could add fees."}
