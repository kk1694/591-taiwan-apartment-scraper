{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "East Minghe Street (東明合街), Nangang District, near Military Cemetery Station (370m)", "notes": "3BR/2BA whole-floor unit in a 13-story elevator building, move-in ready with furniture and appliances included plus a parking space. Had a simple renovation 3 years ago so likely in decent but not brand-new condition. For a couple with a baby: the 2F location is convenient but note the west-facing orientation may get hot afternoon sun; there is a balcony (check railing height/gaps for child safety); no pets allowed; management fee is an additional NT$5,032/month on top of the NT$58,000 rent. The description is minimal (agent promotional text) which is a minor red flag — request a viewing to verify actual condition."}
