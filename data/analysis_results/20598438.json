{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a very clean, modern unfurnished apartment with pristine white walls, polished tile floors, and updated fixtures including recessed lighting and air conditioning. The unit appears well-maintained with multiple rooms accessed via a hallway, good natural light from windows, and a modern kitchen with microwave. For baby safety, the space has no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings, and corners appear rounded; the smooth tile floors would be easy to clean but slippery for a crawling baby."}
