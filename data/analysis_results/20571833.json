{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious well-maintained apartment with modern finishes including recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and split AC units. The unit features polished tile and hardwood flooring, decorative wallpaper, and appears very clean. For baby safety, the open floor plan is good but the stone water feature in the bathroom area and slippery polished floors may need attention; no visible balcony hazards in photos but natural light appears limited to one balcony area."}
