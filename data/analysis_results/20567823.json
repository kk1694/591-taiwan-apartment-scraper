{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with clean white finishes, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture. High ceilings with mezzanine area visible. Baby safety considerations: tile floors are easy to clean but hard if falling; no visible balcony railings in photos; furniture has rounded edges which is good. Good natural light from large windows. The unit appears clean and move-in ready with modern appliances including Hitachi refrigerator and built-in oven."}
