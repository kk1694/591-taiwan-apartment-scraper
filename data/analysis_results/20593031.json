{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern, upscale apartment with luxurious finishes including marble-top coffee table, white leather sofas, built-in TV cabinet, crystal chandelier, recessed ceiling lighting, and elegant dining set. The unit is spacious (54 ping) with large bay windows providing excellent natural light and views of greenery. For baby safety, the marble coffee table has sharp angular corners that would need padding, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows on the 2nd floor have a low balcony railing that should be checked; the smooth tile floors are easy to clean but slippery. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), this is a premium, well-maintained unit in a 9-story building that very likely has an elevator."}
