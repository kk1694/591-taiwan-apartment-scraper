{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Spacious, modern high-rise apartment (12F/14F) with high-end finishes including polished marble-look tile floors, recessed and designer lighting, built-in wood-panel cabinetry, a stylish curved kitchen island with LED accent lighting, and central air conditioning. The living room has floor-to-ceiling sliding doors opening to a balcony which is a baby safety concern; the bedroom has large windows with excellent natural light and wood flooring suitable for a nursery. The unit is very clean and in excellent condition with no visible red flags, though it is mostly unfurnished and the hard tile floors in common areas and sharp corners on the glass coffee table and kitchen island would need baby-proofing."}
