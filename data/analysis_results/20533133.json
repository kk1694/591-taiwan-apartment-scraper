{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Clean, spacious unfurnished apartment in good modern condition with polished tile floors, wall-mounted AC units, ceiling fans, and an en-suite bathroom with modern vanity. The 9th floor unit in a 14-story building likely has an elevator. For baby safety, the windows have sturdy metal railings which is good, but the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from play mats; no visible stairs or sharp corners are a plus. Good natural light from large windows, very clean walls and floors with no visible damage or red flags, though being completely unfurnished means significant furniture investment needed."}
