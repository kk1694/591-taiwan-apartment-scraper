{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District, near mountains", "notes": "This is a recently renovated 1F/2F low-rise house in Shilin with clean white walls, recessed lighting, modern flooring, and AC units. The unit is unfurnished and spacious at ~50 ping with a private garden/yard area surrounded by greenery and mountain views. For a couple with a baby, the ground-floor access eliminates stair concerns for daily use, but being a two-story unit means internal stairs between floors which would need baby gates; the yard has low stone walls and stepping-stone paths that a toddler could trip on. Good natural light from multiple windows, very clean condition, and managed by UR House (a foreigner-friendly agency), though the listing description is minimal and the price is relatively high for an unfurnished unit."}
