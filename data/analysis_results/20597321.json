{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": null, "notes": "Modern high-rise building with sleek black-and-white facade, upscale lobby with marble reception desk and security access, recessed LED ceiling lighting in hallways, and a smart toilet with integrated bidet in the bathroom. However, all images show only building exterior, common areas, and a bathroom — no interior living space photos are provided, making it impossible to assess the actual apartment layout, natural light, or baby safety concerns. The listing description is essentially just an agent advertisement with no real property details, which is a significant red flag — this may be a bait listing or the unit could be an office/commercial space rather than a residential flat."}
