{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, fully renovated apartment with high-end finishes including light wood flooring, recessed ceiling AC, built-in cabinetry, and contemporary furniture. The unit appears to be a large open-plan studio with living area and bedroom in one space, listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent). For baby safety, the open layout has minimal sharp corners but the bed has wooden bench-style footboard pieces that could be a concern; the large windows/balcony area with frosted glass sliding doors should be checked for secure locks. The space is very clean and bright with good natural light from multiple windows, and at 5F/14F the building almost certainly has an elevator."}
