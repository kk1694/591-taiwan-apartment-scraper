{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, well-furnished apartment in clean condition with wood-panel accent walls, recessed lighting, split AC units, and a compact but functional kitchen with induction cooktop, washing machine, fridge, and microwave. The glass-top coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the bedroom has a small balcony door/window area that should be checked for secure locking. Good natural light from large windows in both the living room and bedroom; the 14-story building on 4F almost certainly has an elevator. Overall a nice unit, though the kitchen is quite compact and the 28-ping size feels tight for a 2-room layout with a growing family."}
