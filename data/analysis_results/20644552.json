{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongxiao East Road Section 5, Xinyi District", "notes": "Unfurnished older apartment in clean but dated condition with crown molding, old-style AC units, and basic tile flooring. The unit is spacious at 35 ping with multiple rooms visible including what appears to be 3+ bedrooms, built-in sliding-door closets, and a balcony with iron security grilles. For baby safety, the hard tile floors would benefit from play mats, exposed wiring near one AC unit needs securing, and the balcony grilles appear adequate; being on 4F of a 5F walk-up building with no elevator would be challenging with a stroller and baby gear. Natural light appears limited with small windows and dark balcony area."}
