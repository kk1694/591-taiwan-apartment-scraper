{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious and well-maintained apartment with beautiful hardwood parquet flooring throughout, central air conditioning, and a Japanese-style decorative garden feature in the entryway. The living room is large with leather sofas, built-in shelving, and a TV unit; the master bedroom is extremely spacious with ample built-in wardrobe storage. Baby safety concerns include the raised step around the decorative rock garden feature (tripping/falling hazard), the glass-topped coffee table with sharp corners, and small pebbles in the garden feature that pose a choking hazard. Natural light appears moderate through curtained windows. Overall the unit is clean, upscale, and generously sized at 73 ping, though the listing description is minimal (agent promotional text only), which is a minor red flag."}
