{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District", "notes": "Older apartment (likely 1980s-90s) with dated dark marble floors, ornate wooden door, crystal chandeliers, heavy wooden built-in cabinetry, and old-style leather furniture. The building is a 7-floor walk-up with only staircase access (image 3 shows stairwell with no elevator), which is a major concern with a stroller and baby. Baby safety concerns include the dark polished marble/stone floors which can be slippery, the open stairwell visible in the hallway, and glass-front cabinets in the dining area. The space is large at 48 ping but feels dark with limited natural light; the listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag suggesting minimal effort from the landlord."}
