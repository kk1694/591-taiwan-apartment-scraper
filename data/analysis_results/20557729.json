{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Modern, well-renovated apartment with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, stylish concrete-effect TV accent wall, and updated bathroom with marble-look tiles and modern vanity. The living room is spacious with large curtained windows suggesting decent natural light. For baby safety, the hard tile floors could be slippery and the coffee table has sharp corners that would need padding; no balcony or stairs are visible in the photos, which is a plus. Listed through UR HOUSE (a foreigner-friendly rental agency), and being on the 3rd floor of a 5-floor walkup means no elevator is likely, which could be challenging with a stroller and baby gear."}
