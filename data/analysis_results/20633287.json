{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern kitchen (glass backsplash, gas stove, range hood), dark wood built-in cabinetry, polished tile and hardwood floors, AC units, and a clean bathroom with glass-enclosed shower/bathtub and modern fixtures. For baby safety: the bathroom glass partition and bathtub edge need child-proofing, the slippery polished tile floors are a concern for a crawling baby, and windows have security grilles which is good. Being on 3F of a 4F walkup with no visible elevator means carrying a stroller up stairs daily, which is a significant drawback for a couple with an infant. Natural light appears moderate with windows on multiple sides but nearby buildings are close."}
