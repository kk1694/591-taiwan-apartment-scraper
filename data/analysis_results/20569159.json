{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern loft-style apartment with high ceilings, stylish finishes, glass mezzanine level, fully equipped kitchen with gas stove and dishwasher, and good natural light from windows on the upper level. Major baby safety concern: the open metal staircase to the mezzanine has no railings or barriers, posing a serious fall risk for a crawling baby or toddler; the glass mezzanine floor/railing is also a concern. The unit is clean and well-maintained but the loft layout with exposed stairs makes it poorly suited for a family with an infant growing into a mobile child."}
