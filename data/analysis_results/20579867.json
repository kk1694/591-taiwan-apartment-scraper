{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained apartment with modern built-in cabinetry, recessed lighting, and light wood flooring throughout. The living room is spacious with L-shaped sofa, the bedroom has a platform bed frame and natural light, and there is a small study/office nook with built-in desk and shelving. The bathroom is basic but clean with a wet-floor shower area (slippery when wet - a concern with a baby). The coffee table has sharp corners and the bedroom has decorative wall niches with sharp edges that may need baby-proofing. At 4F/12F the building very likely has an elevator, which is important for a stroller. No kitchen is shown in the photos, which is a potential red flag worth confirming."}
