{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious classical European-style apartment with ornate ceiling moldings, marble floors, and leather furniture. Very spacious with excellent natural light from large windows. For baby safety: hard marble/tile floors throughout, sharp-cornered marble coffee table, and glass-top furniture pose concerns. No stairs visible but the heavy classical furniture and hard surfaces would need baby-proofing."}
