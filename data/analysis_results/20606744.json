{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with clean white finishes, recessed lighting, and contemporary furniture. Excellent natural light through large windows. The space appears relatively baby-safe with no visible stairs, smooth tile floors, and rounded furniture edges, though the glass dining table and balcony access would need childproofing."}
