{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang District", "notes": "Brand new, unfurnished modern apartment in a new-construction high-rise (8F/26F). Very clean with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, wall-mounted AC, modern kitchen with Whirlpool fridge and built-in cabinetry, and a sleek glass-enclosed bathroom. The unit appears completely empty which is ideal for baby-proofing from scratch; no balcony visible in photos which is safer for a child, though the hard tile floors could be a concern for a crawling baby. Good natural light from large dark-framed windows; overall excellent condition with no red flags."}
