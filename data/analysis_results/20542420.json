{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, clean apartment with minimalist white interior, polished tile floors, contemporary furniture, and high ceilings. The unit appears baby-safe with no visible balcony access in photos, rounded furniture corners, and single-level layout. Excellent natural light through large windows with curtains; the 14-story building on 2F strongly suggests elevator access. No red flags - well-maintained and move-in ready."}
