{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a dated but functional apartment on the top floor (14F/14F) in Zhongshan with dark wood flooring, older wooden furniture, and a small kitchenette with gas stove, microwave, and small fridge. The glass coffee table with sharp metal edges is a baby safety concern, and loose cords/vacuum on the kitchen floor are tripping hazards. Being on the top floor of a high-rise likely means elevator access, but the listing is agent-posted with minimal description, and the unit appears somewhat cluttered and worn with limited natural light from small windows."}
