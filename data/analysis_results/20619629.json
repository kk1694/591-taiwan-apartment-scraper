{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in Da'an with modern finishes including recessed LED lighting, light wood-tone laminate flooring, new white kitchen cabinetry, and a fully updated bathroom with glass-enclosed rain shower. The space is very clean and well-maintained. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is positive, but the glass shower door in the bathroom and lack of visible window guards on some windows are concerns; the windows do appear to have security grilles on the exterior. Natural light is moderate with frosted/translucent windows. At 3F with no elevator info available, carrying a stroller up stairs could be an issue. The listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — request more details on layout and included furnishings."}
