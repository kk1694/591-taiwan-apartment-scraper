{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Very well-maintained modern apartment with custom wood-panel interior design, recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, digital door lock, and video intercom. The living room has large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light, and a separate dining area with stylish pendant lighting. For baby safety, the large windows near the living area and what appears to be a balcony door in image 4 would need childproofing; the wood slat room dividers have gaps a child could reach through. No visible stairs, and floors are smooth light wood laminate throughout — overall a clean, high-quality unit in a 16-floor building that very likely has an elevator."}
