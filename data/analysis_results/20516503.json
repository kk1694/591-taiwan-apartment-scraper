{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "N", "location": "Neihu", "notes": "This is a European-style multi-story townhouse/villa in Neihu, not a flat apartment. The interior is well-furnished with modern fixtures, recessed lighting, wine storage bar area, and glass dining table. Major baby safety concerns: the property has internal stairs between levels with no visible baby gates, a glass coffee table and glass dining table with sharp edges, and the multi-level layout would be challenging with a crawling/toddling baby. The living room has good natural light from large sliding doors leading to a small patio area. The listing description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), which is a red flag — the 80K/month price and 66 ping size suggest this is an upscale townhouse but the lack of detail on layout, rooms, and amenities warrants caution."}
