{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment in excellent condition with high-end built-in cabinetry, recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, modern kitchen with gas stove and range hood, and a dedicated study/bedroom with built-in desk and storage. The flat floors with no stairs and smooth rounded furniture edges are fairly baby-friendly, though the polished tile floors could be slippery for a crawling toddler. Large windows provide excellent natural light with lush greenery views; the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad placeholder) which is a minor red flag — verify layout and actual room count in person."}
