{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Shilin District", "notes": "Spacious 63-ping apartment in very good condition with modern finishes throughout: recessed lighting, decorative ceiling, hardwood floors in bedroom, large U-shaped kitchen with gas stove and ample cabinetry, and a well-appointed bathroom with both bathtub and separate glass-enclosed shower. The living room has polished tile floors with clean corners and the overall space is very clean and well-maintained. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors in the living area are good, the glass shower partition and bathtub would need childproofing, and the kitchen island counter has accessible sharp edges; no balcony or stair hazards visible in photos. The description is minimal (just a broker ad placeholder), providing no details about the building or amenities, and at NT$78,000/month this is a premium rental likely in a quality community building."}
