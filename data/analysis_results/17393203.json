{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a well-maintained modern luxury apartment in a high-rise building with floor-to-ceiling windows, marble accent walls, recessed lighting, and a sleek white leather sectional sofa. Excellent natural light throughout. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp edges that would need protection, and the floor-to-ceiling windows with low glass railings near the balcony area are a concern for a crawling/walking child. The unit appears clean and spacious at nearly 45 ping."}
