{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious luxury apartment with high-end finishes including recessed LED cove lighting, hardwood floors, and marble tile. Very clean condition with large windows providing excellent natural light and mountain views. Good for a baby - open floor plan with minimal sharp corners, no visible stairs, and windows appear secure; the main concern would be the glass coffee table edges which could be padded."}
