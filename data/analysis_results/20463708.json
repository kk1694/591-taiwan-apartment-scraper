{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with pristine white tile floors, recessed lighting, central AC, and high-quality built-in cabinetry throughout. The space is extremely clean with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors may be slippery; no balcony railings visible in photos, but corners appear rounded on built-in furniture. Being on floor 5 of 14 strongly suggests elevator access."}
