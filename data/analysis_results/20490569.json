{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxurious, brand-new condition apartment with high-end custom cabinetry, marble/stone accent walls, recessed LED lighting, built-in appliances, and premium wood flooring throughout. The 17-story building on floor 7 almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the windows have horizontal security bars/louvers which is good, corners on the dark stone kitchen island are sharp and would need padding, and the raised platform bed in the second bedroom could be a tripping hazard for a toddler. Excellent natural light with green mountain views from multiple windows; overall a very clean, move-in ready premium unit."}
