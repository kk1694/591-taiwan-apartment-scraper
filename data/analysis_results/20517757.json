{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with sleek white cabinetry, wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, and high-quality finishes throughout. Excellent natural light from large sliding glass door to balcony. For baby safety: balcony access needs childproofing, cabinet corners are squared but rounded edges on island, floor-level windows require attention. Clean, move-in ready condition with built-in wardrobes, modern kitchen with gas stove, and integrated appliances."}
