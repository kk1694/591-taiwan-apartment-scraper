Good natural light from large windows on the 9th floor; the unit is unfurnished and very clean. For baby safety, the floors are smooth and flat with no stairs, but the glass bathroom doors and slatted room dividers should be baby-proofed, and the windows on a high floor will need secure locks; no dangerous balcony is visible."}
