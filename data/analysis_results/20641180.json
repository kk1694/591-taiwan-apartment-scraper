{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and clean apartment with new built-in wooden cabinetry, recessed LED lighting, smart home panel by the door, and central air conditioning. The living area has a balcony with proper metal railings (good for baby safety), and the bedroom has blackout roller blinds with large windows for natural light. The coffee table has sharp edges on metal hairpin legs which would need baby-proofing, and the space appears to be a compact studio-style layout despite the 24-ping size claim — only a living room, small kitchen area, and one bedroom are visible, which seems small for NT$55,000/month. Being on 6F/7F the balcony sliding door access would need a child lock once the baby is mobile."}
