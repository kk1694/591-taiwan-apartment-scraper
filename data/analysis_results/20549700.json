{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-renovated modern apartment with recessed lighting, split AC units in every room, built-in TV wall, ceiling fan, and polished tile floors throughout. The 40-ping size is generous with a spacious living/dining area and at least two bedrooms with floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the bedroom balcony has a glass door with metal railings that appear to have adequate spacing, but the round marble coffee table has sharp metal frame edges and the glass-front fish tank on the dining table would need to be secured; the raised step near the kitchen hallway is a tripping hazard for a toddler. Overall very clean and move-in ready, being a 10-story building on the 4th floor it very likely has an elevator."}
