{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Spacious and well-maintained apartment on 11F/14F with hardwood floors, recessed lighting, modern kitchen with built-in appliances, and large windows providing good natural light and city views. At least two bedrooms visible, both with en-suite access and decent size. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors to the balcony need child locks, and the glass coffee table in the living room has sharp corners that would need padding; the diamond-pattern mirrored wall in the dining area could be a hazard if broken. Overall clean and move-in ready, though furnishings appear slightly dated in style despite being in good condition."}
