{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious 49.7 ping apartment with European-classic styling — ornate furniture, Persian rugs, decorative fireplace, and hardwood floors throughout. The decor is dated/heavy rather than modern, though well-maintained. For baby safety: glass-top coffee tables with sharp corners, many small decorative objects at low height, and a glass-front door between living and kitchen area are concerns; no balcony visible but low window seats in bedrooms need childproofing. Natural light appears limited (3F with trees visible outside, mostly lamp-lit interiors). The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a minor red flag — verify layout, number of rooms, and lease terms directly."}
