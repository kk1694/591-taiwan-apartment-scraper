{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Well-maintained modern apartment with high ceilings, marble accent wall, clean tile floors, and updated kitchen with red cabinetry and LG appliances. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows. For baby safety: the glass display shelving with decorative items would need securing, and the coffee table has sharp corners. No visible balcony access concerns; overall very clean condition suitable for a family."}
