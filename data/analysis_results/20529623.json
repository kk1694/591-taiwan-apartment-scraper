{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with contemporary furnishings, white/neutral color scheme, and clean finishes. The unit features a spacious open-plan living area, modern kitchen with induction cooktop and range hood, and a bedroom with floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light. For baby safety, the low platform bed has minimal fall risk, but the large floor-to-ceiling balcony doors would need childproofing; no visible sharp corners or hazardous railings. Building appears to be a newer high-rise which almost certainly has an elevator at 10 floors."}
