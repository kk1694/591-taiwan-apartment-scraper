{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Very modern and stylishly renovated apartment with high-end finishes including wood-grain paneling, white brick accent wall, recessed lighting, black-framed glass partition doors, and quality wood-look flooring. The unit appears clean and well-maintained, managed by UR HOUSE rental services. For baby safety, the glass partition doors with metal frames could be a pinch hazard, and the raised platform bed area visible through the partition may need edge guards; natural light appears limited based on this image. The listing description is minimal (just an ad placeholder), so further details about layout and amenities should be confirmed directly."}
