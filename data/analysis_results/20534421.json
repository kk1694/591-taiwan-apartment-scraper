{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious traditional Taiwanese apartment with dated decor including ornate curtains, crystal chandelier, and beige leather sofas. The living room is large with good natural light from windows, but the style is from the 2000s era. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard, there appear to be glass display shelves with decorative items that would need securing, and the cluttered items visible could pose hazards. The space is reasonably clean but cluttered with personal belongings."}
