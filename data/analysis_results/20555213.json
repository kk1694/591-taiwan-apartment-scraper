{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongshan District", "notes": "Spacious and modern apartment in excellent clean condition with recessed lighting, polished tile floors, and quality wooden furniture. The flat layout with no visible stairs is baby-friendly, though the glass-topped coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing; large curtained windows suggest good natural light potential. Managed by HOYUAN Real Estate Agency (expat-focused agency), and at 49 ping this is a generously sized family apartment on the 7th floor of a 19-story building which almost certainly has an elevator; however only living/dining area photos are shown with no kitchen, bathroom, or bedroom views which is a minor red flag."}
