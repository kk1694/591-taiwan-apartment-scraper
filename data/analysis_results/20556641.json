{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-furnished apartment in excellent condition with contemporary furniture, stylish pendant lighting, and clean tile flooring. The space appears spacious at 49 ping with open living/dining layout and a separate study area. For baby safety, the glass coffee table with sharp corners and open bookshelf would need childproofing; no visible balcony concerns in these images. Good natural light from large curtained windows, and the 2F location in a 14-floor building suggests elevator access."}
