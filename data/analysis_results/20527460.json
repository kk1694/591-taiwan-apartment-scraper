{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment at 46 ping with hardwood floors throughout, fully furnished with heavy traditional wooden furniture and leather sofas. The unit has at least 3 bedrooms with decent natural light and a small balcony visible from the living room; the 8th floor in a 17-story building strongly suggests elevator access. For baby safety, the marble-top coffee table has sharp corners, the balcony access from the living room needs a gate, and the heavy furniture is generally stable but the overall dated decor and cluttered furnishings may require childproofing effort."}
