{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean but dated apartment with older-style furnishings including an ornate gold TV frame, pink closet doors, and basic furniture. The glass coffee table with exposed sharp edges and the internal stairs between the split-level living room and bedroom are significant baby safety concerns. Good natural light from large balcony windows on a high floor (10F/13F) with balcony railings visible; the balcony decorative railing pattern has gaps that could be hazardous for a toddler. Listed by Miller House agency; the description is minimal placeholder text with no real property details, which is a minor red flag."}
