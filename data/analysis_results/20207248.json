{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang", "notes": "Very spacious and modern apartment in excellent condition with clean white tile floors, recessed lighting, large floor-to-ceiling windows with balcony access providing good natural light, and a digital door lock. The glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing, and the balcony sliding doors should be secured with child locks once the baby is mobile. The unit features central air conditioning, a separate kitchen, and generous living space at ~49 ping — well-suited for a growing family. Building is 15 floors suggesting elevator access; overall very clean with no visible red flags."}
