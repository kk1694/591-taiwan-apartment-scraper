{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Large spacious apartment with traditional/classical style furniture and decor rather than modern finishes. The unit is very clean with polished tile floors, good natural light from large windows, and recessed ceiling lighting. For baby safety, the open floor plan is positive but the ornate furniture has sharp corners and edges that would need protection; no visible balcony railings or stairs to assess."}
