{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated 1990s-style wooden built-in furniture, cabinets, and decorative arch columns throughout. The space is spacious at 42 ping with light-colored laminate flooring and decent natural light from the balcony, but window-unit ACs and the overall aesthetic are clearly dated. For baby safety, the balcony has railings visible through sliding glass doors and the 6F/6F top-floor location with no confirmed elevator is a significant concern for stroller access; the heavy wooden furniture has sharp corners that would need padding."}
