{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Brand new or nearly new luxury apartment in a modern high-rise (14F/27F) in Beitou, completely unfurnished with pristine polished tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in cabinets, and a sleek galley kitchen with gas stovetop. The unit is very spacious at ~102 sqm with multiple rooms, large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light, and a balcony accessible from the kitchen with tall railings. Excellent for a family with a baby — no stairs, flat single-level layout, no sharp furniture concerns since it's empty, and the polished tile floors are easy to clean though may be slippery; the balcony has proper vertical bar railings for child safety."}
