The unit features a spacious living/dining area, two bedrooms (master with ensuite), and a modern bathroom with bathtub. For baby safety: the glass coffee table has sharp corners, the bathtub requires supervision, and the glass desk in the second bedroom has exposed metal frame edges. Overall excellent condition with good natural light through multiple windows."}
