{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "天母泉宇大廈", "notes": "Older building complex from the 1980s-90s with red brick exterior. Images show only exterior courtyard and an enclosed balcony/utility area with dated fixtures. No interior living space photos provided, making it impossible to assess actual apartment condition. The enclosed balcony has vertical window bars which are good for baby safety. The building has a well-maintained garden courtyard but the apartment interior remains unknown - a significant red flag for this price point."}
