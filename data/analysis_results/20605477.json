{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in very clean condition with stylish finishes, recessed lighting, large windows providing abundant natural light, and a well-equipped kitchen with dishwasher and washing machine. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), the unit has at least two bedrooms, a living/dining area, and built-in wardrobes. For baby safety, the large floor-to-ceiling windows should be checked for secure locks, and the glass coffee table with metal edges in the living room could pose a concern; the open floor plan is otherwise spacious and relatively safe with no visible stairs or dangerous balcony railings. At 27 ping on the 3rd floor of a 10-story building (very likely to have an elevator), this is a strong option for a family in the premium Da'an district."}
