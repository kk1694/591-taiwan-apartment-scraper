{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Unfurnished older apartment with freshly painted white walls but dated green-and-white diamond-patterned marble tile flooring throughout. The unit is completely empty with no kitchen or bathroom visible in photos; appears to have multiple rooms with an AC unit and wall-mounted intercom. The slippery polished marble floors are a significant baby safety concern, and the 3F walkup with no elevator would be difficult for a pregnant woman or with a stroller. Natural light is moderate through frosted sliding windows; the listing description is essentially just an ad placeholder with no real property details, which is a red flag."}
