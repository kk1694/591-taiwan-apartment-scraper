{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "N", "location": "世貿帝國 (World Trade Empire Building), Nangang", "notes": "This is a commercial/office space, not a residential apartment. The interior shows an open-plan office layout with desks, printers, computers, track lighting, and exposed concrete ceilings. The hallway has a chalkboard wall with graffiti art and a basic shared bathroom labeled 廁間. The ground floor has multiple commercial shops (auto parts, safety equipment). Completely unsuitable for a family with a baby — this is not a residential unit despite being listed at 59 ping. Major red flag: the listing description is just a generic agent advertisement with no actual property details."}
