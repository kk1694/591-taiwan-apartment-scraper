{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern high-rise apartment on 12F/26F with contemporary built-in cabinetry, LED ambient ceiling lighting, laminate wood flooring, and a clean modern bathroom with electronic bidet toilet. The living room has large floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors with good natural light and city views; however, the two bedrooms shown are quite small with only single mattresses on the floor and limited natural light from small windows, which may feel cramped for a couple with a baby. For baby safety, the floor-to-ceiling glass doors in the living area would need child locks, and the apartment appears mostly unfurnished with minimal sharp corners, which is a positive."}
