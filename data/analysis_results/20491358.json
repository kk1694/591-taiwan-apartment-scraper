{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated fixtures including retro ceiling lights, old-style sliding doors with patterned glass, and worn tile flooring. The unit is spacious (23 ping) and mostly empty/unfurnished with clean white walls and tile floors, which is good for baby-proofing. On 4F of a 7-story building with no elevator confirmed; the kitchen area looks dated with old cabinetry, and natural light appears limited in the main living area though the bedroom has a window. No obvious balcony hazards visible but the old sliding doors with half-wall tiling suggest an enclosed rear balcony area that would need inspection for railing safety."}
