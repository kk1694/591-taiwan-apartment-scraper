{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a spacious unfurnished apartment with dated 90s-style decor featuring decorative wood beam ceilings and older window AC units. The unit has good natural light from large balcony windows with security grilles, but the balcony railings appear to have wide gaps that could be a baby safety concern. The space is clean but empty, with extensive built-in white shelving; tile floors are slippery and would need rugs or baby-proofing for a crawling infant."}
