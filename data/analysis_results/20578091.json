{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older-style top-floor (7F/7F) apartment with dated decor including faux stone walls, wooden staircase leading to rooftop addition, and ornate wooden fixtures. The unit is spacious and unfurnished with good natural light from large windows, but the internal staircase is a significant baby safety hazard requiring gates. Being the top floor with a rooftop structure raises concerns about heat, potential leaks, and the legality of the rooftop addition; the listing description is minimal (just an agent ad), which is a red flag."}
