{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a duplex/loft-style apartment with interior stairs and mezzanine level with wooden balustrade railings - significant baby safety concern as the staircase is open and the upper railing gaps could be hazardous for small children. The apartment appears clean but dated with older-style herringbone parquet flooring, traditional crown molding, and classic chandeliers. Good natural light from large windows and enclosed balcony, reasonably spacious rooms with AC units."}
