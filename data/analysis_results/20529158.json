{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious modern studio with clean minimalist design, light wood flooring, white walls, high ceilings, and excellent natural light from floor-to-ceiling balcony doors. Very clean condition with quality furnishings. For baby safety, the balcony railings appear to have vertical bars which is good, but the open floor plan with exposed track lighting pipes on ceiling and furniture with some sharp corners may need childproofing later."}
