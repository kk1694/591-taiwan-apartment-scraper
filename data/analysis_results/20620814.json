{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Beautifully renovated apartment with modern Scandinavian-style finishes, recessed LED lighting, and quality built-in cabinetry throughout. The unit appears clean and well-maintained with a separate bedroom, glass-enclosed bathroom, and open kitchen/living area. For baby safety, note the small step near the entryway and the glass bathroom enclosure; overall the flat layout and rounded furniture edges are favorable. Natural light appears limited based on the images."}
