{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a modern duplex/loft-style apartment with double-height ceilings, contemporary finishes including dark wood flooring, built-in storage, and split AC units. Baby safety concerns include an elevated loft area with metal railings that a toddler could slip through, and internal stairs leading to the upper level. The space appears clean with good natural light from large windows, but the open loft design requires careful childproofing."}
