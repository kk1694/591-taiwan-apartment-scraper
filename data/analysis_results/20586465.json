{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious and modern unfurnished 4-bedroom apartment in excellent condition with high-end built-in cabinetry, recessed ceiling AC, polished tile and hardwood flooring, and large windows providing good natural light. The unit is on the 7th floor of a 10-story building (almost certainly with elevator), and the balcony railings visible through the windows appear to be sturdy horizontal metal bars at safe height; the smooth tile floors are slippery which could be a concern for a crawling baby, and the dark wood-trimmed sharp cabinet corners in the living room may need edge guards. The apartment is completely empty and clean, offering a blank canvas with generous space ideal for a growing family."}
