{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District, near MRT City Hall Station (中信房屋捷運市府店 agent)", "notes": "Excellent modern apartment in a high-rise building with gym and social lounge amenities. Interior is very clean with contemporary wood-panel design, recessed lighting, central AC, and light wood flooring throughout. The living room is spacious with large windows and sheer curtains for good natural light. For baby safety, the balcony area visible through the living room glass door should be checked for railing gaps; the rooms have no sharp corners and the flat layout on a single level is stroller-friendly. Being 5F in a tall modern building confirms elevator access. A second bedroom is empty and could serve as a nursery. Minor note: the listing description is minimal (agent promotion text only), so confirm lease terms and whether the 46-ping size includes shared space."}
