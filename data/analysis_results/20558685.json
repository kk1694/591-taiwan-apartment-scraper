{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Datong District", "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment on the 15th floor of a 26-story building with recessed LED lighting, concealed central air conditioning, marble-top coffee table, leather sofa, and a sleek kitchen bar area. The unit appears very clean with a minimalist design and smooth tile flooring. For baby safety, the balcony has a floor-to-ceiling glass sliding door which should be kept locked; the marble coffee table has sharp edges that would need corner guards; the bar stools could be a tipping hazard for a toddler. Only living room photos are shown — no bedroom, bathroom, or kitchen views, which is a minor red flag as the listing description is essentially empty (just a broker ad). The high floor in a 26-story tower virtually guarantees an elevator."}
