{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern studio apartment with high-end finishes, built-in appliances including wine cooler and oven, sleek cabinetry, and clean minimalist design. Building appears modern (15-story building on 6F strongly suggests elevator). For baby safety, the space is compact with no visible stairs or balcony hazards, though the TV on a freestanding stand and some exposed cords would need securing."}
