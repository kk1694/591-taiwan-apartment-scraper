{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This is a commercial/retail space, NOT a residential apartment. Image 1 shows it was previously used as a beauty salon or spa with treatment beds, a reception counter, and product display shelves. Images 3-5 show the space stripped bare with exposed concrete ceilings, track lighting, industrial AC units, and exposed piping — clearly a raw commercial shell ready for a new tenant's fit-out. The listing description mentions a real estate agent sales package, further confirming this is a commercial property listing. Completely unsuitable for residential use with a baby."}
