{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Well-designed modern apartment with warm wood paneling, stone accent walls, recessed lighting, and hardwood floors throughout. The open-plan living area is spacious with a kitchen island, large TV, and good natural light from large windows with blinds; the 12th-floor unit in an 18-story building almost certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the live-edge wood coffee table has sharp edges, exposed wires near the TV stand need securing, and the open shelving unit could be a climbing hazard, but the flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus. Listed through Hoyuan Real Estate Agency, the description is minimal (agent promotional text only), which is a minor red flag — worth requesting more details on bedroom count, bathroom, and lease terms."}
