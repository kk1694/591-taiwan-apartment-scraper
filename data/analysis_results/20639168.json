{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly built apartment in excellent condition with marble-look tile flooring, modern sliding glass doors, split AC units, and a contemporary building facade. The floor plan shows a 2-bedroom layout with living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, and a balcony — the balconies have sturdy metal railings with narrow spacing which is good for baby safety, though the sliding glass doors to the balcony areas would need child locks. The unit is mostly unfurnished and very clean with good natural light from large windows; at 5F/7F the building likely has an elevator given its modern construction style."}
