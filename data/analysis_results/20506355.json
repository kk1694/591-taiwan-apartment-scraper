{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a former commercial retail space (branded signage 'Darebro Mouette' visible on wall, sales signage, reception counter area) rather than a residential apartment. The space has commercial track lighting, a commercial-style layout with open floor plan, and fluorescent tube lighting in back room. Not suitable for residential living - lacks kitchen, bathroom facilities visible, and has commercial infrastructure. For a family with baby, this would require significant renovation to convert to residential use."}
