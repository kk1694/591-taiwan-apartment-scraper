{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern, clean studio/1-bedroom apartment with recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, AC, washing machine, microwave, fridge, and a kitchenette. Managed by HOYUAN Real Estate Agency (禾源外商租屋管理公司), suggesting foreigner-friendly management. The glass coffee table has sharp edges which is a concern for a crawling baby, and the bedroom area is separated only by a curtain rather than a door. No visible balcony but large windows on the 9th floor appear to have secure railings. Overall very clean and well-maintained, though at 20.5 ping it may feel tight for a couple with a baby."}
