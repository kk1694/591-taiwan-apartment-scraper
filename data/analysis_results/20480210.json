{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-renovated apartment in excellent condition with modern finishes including recessed LED lighting, sleek white kitchen cabinets, and quality flooring. The living room has large floor-to-ceiling windows providing good natural light, though the glass coffee table has sharp corners that would need baby-proofing. The unit appears very clean with ample built-in storage; balcony visible through sliding doors should be checked for proper railing height for child safety."}
