{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is an older-style Taiwanese apartment with dated 1990s-era furniture including covered sofas, ornate wooden cabinets, and a glass coffee table with sharp corners that would need baby-proofing. The kitchen has an old window AC unit, basic gas stove, and worn tile floors. The marble floors are clean and polished with good natural light from the balcony, but the overall decor is dated. The balcony has metal railings that appear adequately spaced for safety."}
