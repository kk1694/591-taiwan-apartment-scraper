{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "This is a studio/suite on the top floor (11F/11F) with a somewhat dated interior featuring ornate ceiling moldings and older-style white cabinetry, though it is clean and well-maintained. The bedroom area appears to be on a raised loft/mezzanine level which is a significant baby safety concern due to the elevated bed platform and potential fall risk; the kitchen is compact but functional with a range hood and induction cooktop. Good natural light from multiple windows, but at ~29 sqm it will be tight for a couple with a baby, and the top-floor location may mean heat issues in summer."}
