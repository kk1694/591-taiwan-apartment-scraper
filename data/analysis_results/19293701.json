{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment with clean minimalist design, built-in cabinetry, modern kitchen appliances, and split AC units. The balcony has floor-to-ceiling glass sliding doors which would need baby-proofing. Bedroom is compact but adequate. Good natural light from windows. Being on floor 11 of 12 strongly suggests elevator access."}
