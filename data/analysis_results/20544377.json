{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "?", "location": "Beitou District", "notes": "Brand new/newly constructed unfurnished unit with modern grey tile flooring, clean white walls, and black-framed windows. The building hallway (images 3-4) shows polished marble floors, elevator access, fire safety equipment, and an exit sign, confirming a modern elevator building. However, the unit appears to be an empty shell — completely unfurnished with exposed ceiling pipes, bare bulb lighting, floor drains, and no kitchen or bathroom fixtures visible — which raises concerns about whether this is truly move-in ready or possibly a commercial/office space rather than a finished residential apartment. For a couple with a baby, the balcony sliding door on the 6th floor needs child-safe locks, and the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from rugs or padding."}
