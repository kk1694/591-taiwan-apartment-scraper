{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "N", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated apartment in Xinyi with modern light wood flooring, clean white walls, and stylish furnishings including a grey sectional sofa and dining set. The kitchen has older tile backsplash and cabinets but is functional. For baby safety, the glass coffee table has sharp metal corners, the narrow balcony/utility area with washing machine has metal security grilles but exposed pipes and electrical panels, and the bedroom window is low — all areas to childproof. Natural light appears limited with small windows and blinds throughout. At 3F with no elevator in an older 5-floor walkup, carrying a stroller up stairs daily would be a concern."}
