{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Luxury modern apartment with high-end finishes including herringbone wood flooring, textured accent walls, sleek open kitchen with island, and glass partition doors. Very clean and well-maintained with recessed lighting and central AC. For baby safety: the open-plan layout has sharp kitchen island corners and glass doors that need consideration; however, no visible stairs or balconies in images. Limited natural light visible (photos taken at night) which warrants daytime viewing."}
