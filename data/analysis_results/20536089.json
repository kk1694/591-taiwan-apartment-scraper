{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-maintained apartment in a newer high-rise building (7F/19F) with recessed ceiling lighting, central AC, dark hardwood floors, and contemporary furnishings. The bathroom is clean with a glass-enclosed shower, modern vanity, and ventilation fan. The balcony/laundry area has sturdy metal railings with narrow gaps which is good for baby safety, though the glass shower door and sharp-cornered coffee table in the living room would need childproofing. Good natural light from large floor-to-ceiling windows in the bedroom; overall the unit is in excellent condition with no visible red flags."}
