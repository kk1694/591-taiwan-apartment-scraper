{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Modern, well-maintained apartment with clean wood-grain flooring throughout, recessed LED lighting, central AC in the living area and split AC in bedrooms, and built-in cabinetry. Multiple rooms visible with large sliding glass doors leading to balconies—balcony railings appear to be standard height but the sliding doors would need child locks once the baby becomes mobile. The unit is spacious at 42 ping with good natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows in each room; being on the 5th floor of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access. No major red flags—the apartment is clean, unfurnished/lightly furnished, and appears move-in ready, though the description is essentially just an agent advertisement with no useful details about the property."}
