{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern unfurnished apartment in a relatively new building in Beitou with polished tile floors, AC, video intercom, and sliding glass balcony doors. The balcony has glass panel railings at a reasonable height, but the front balcony gaps between the metal frame and glass could be a concern for a toddler; the rear utility balcony has horizontal bar railings which are climbable and a potential baby safety hazard. The unit is spacious (35 ping), very clean, and gets good natural light from multiple balcony sides, though being unfurnished means you will need to purchase all furniture. Being on the 2nd floor of a 14-story building strongly suggests elevator access."}
