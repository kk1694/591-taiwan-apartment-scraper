{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated furniture and fixtures from the 1990s-2000s era, including window AC units, older tile flooring, and traditional Taiwanese wooden furniture. The space is clean and spacious with good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the tile floors are hard (potential fall hazard), the glass coffee table has sharp edges, and some furniture corners are exposed - childproofing would be needed."}
