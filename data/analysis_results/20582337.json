{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Clean, modern studio apartment with white minimalist decor, updated appliances including washing machine, AC, and microwave. The glass coffee table poses a baby safety concern with sharp edges; the bathroom has a bathtub with glass partition which would need childproofing. Natural light appears limited with only one visible window, but overall the space is well-maintained and suitable for a small family."}
