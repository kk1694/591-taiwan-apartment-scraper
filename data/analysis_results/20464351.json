{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Heavily ornate European-baroque style interior with decorative Corinthian columns, crystal chandeliers, ornate moldings, and patterned brocade furniture — dated rather than modern. The glass coffee table with sharp corners and hard marble floors in the living area are baby safety concerns; the bedroom has dark hardwood floors which are slightly better. Natural light appears limited with small windows visible in the bedroom. At 38 ping on the 2nd floor of a 4-story building, it is spacious but the building likely has no elevator given its low-rise older construction."}
