{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment in a newer high-rise building (9F/19F, very likely has elevator) with clean white tile floors, recessed ceiling lighting, AC units, and a well-equipped kitchen with gas stove, range hood, dish dryer, and full-size refrigerator. The unit appears mostly unfurnished with multiple rooms visible (at least 2-3 bedrooms), offering good space at 27 ping. For baby safety, the flat layout with no stairs is positive, but the balcony area with dark curtains/sliding doors would need child-proofing; the sparse furnishing means fewer sharp corners currently but the kitchen gas stove area would need a safety gate."}
