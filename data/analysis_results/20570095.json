{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Spacious and clean modern apartment with wood-look laminate flooring, split AC, open-plan living/dining/kitchen layout, and decent natural light from large windows. The coffee table has sharp corners and low edges that would need baby-proofing, but the flat open floor plan is generally good for a family; no visible stairs or dangerous balcony access. The listing description is minimal (just an agent promotion blurb), and only living area photos are shown — no bedroom or bathroom images, which is a minor red flag worth investigating before committing."}
