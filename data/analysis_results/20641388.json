{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an, near Nanmen (南門)", "notes": "Recently renovated apartment with modern light wood laminate flooring, new AC units, gray leather sofa, and stylish marble-pattern built-in wardrobes in the bedroom. The space is clean and spacious at 30 ping. Being on 7F/7F (top floor) with no elevator info is a concern — older walkup buildings in Da'an often lack elevators, which would be very difficult with a stroller and baby. The bathroom appears older with basic tile despite the renovation; there are visible stairs in one photo suggesting a possible split-level or rooftop access, which is a baby safety concern. Natural light appears limited with small windows."}
