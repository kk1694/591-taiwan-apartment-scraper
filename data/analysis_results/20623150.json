{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Older apartment with dated furnishings including worn leather sofas, old-style window AC unit, and retro kitchen cabinets. The unit is very cluttered with boxes and personal belongings, making it hard to assess true condition; would need significant clearing out. Windows have security grilles which is positive for baby safety, but the heavy clutter, sharp-cornered coffee table, and numerous small items on low surfaces pose hazards for a crawling baby. Natural light is moderate through frosted/grilled windows; the space is spacious at 30 ping but feels cramped due to excessive belongings."}
