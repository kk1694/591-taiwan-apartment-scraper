{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "新光河山 (Xinguang Heshan) community, Wenshan District, near Jingmei River", "notes": "Older but well-maintained apartment in the gated 新光河山 community, a large residential complex in Wenshan. The living room has dated leather furniture and tile flooring but good natural light with panoramic river and mountain views from the 12th floor. The building is a 19-story tower so it certainly has an elevator. For baby safety, the large windows with low sills are a concern and would need child-proofing; the tile floors are hard but easy to clean. The listing description is essentially empty (just an ad for agent services), which is a minor red flag — would need an in-person visit to assess bedrooms, kitchen, and bathroom condition. Nearby sports courts and riverside parks visible from the window are a plus for family life."}
