{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Spacious recently renovated apartment with modern finishes including wood-look flooring, recessed lighting, split AC units, and a well-equipped kitchen with stainless steel French-door refrigerator and stone countertops. The living area and bedrooms are clean and minimalist; one bedroom retains older dark wood built-in wardrobes suggesting partial renovation. For baby safety, the flat layout with no visible stairs is positive, but the 5F/7F floor in an older building (no elevator confirmed) could be challenging with a stroller; window bars are visible which is good for child safety. Natural light appears moderate from the windows shown, and the overall condition is very clean with no major red flags."}
