{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older building from likely 1980s-90s with dated decor including ornate iron gate entrance, brass chandelier, and wood trim. Interior shows wear with stained/dirty marble floors and walls showing age marks. The first floor unit has a private garden courtyard which is a plus, but overgrown vegetation outside and dated interiors suggest maintenance concerns. For a family with baby, the ground floor eliminates stair risks but the overall aged condition and cleanliness issues are red flags."}
