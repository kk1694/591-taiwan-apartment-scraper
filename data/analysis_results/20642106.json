{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very clean, modern apartment in excellent condition with polished tile floors, recessed lighting, built-in wooden cabinetry, wall-mounted AC units, and a video intercom system — appears to be a newer high-rise building that almost certainly has an elevator (6F/13F). The bedroom has a new mattress still in plastic and an en-suite bathroom; windows have secure sliding designs with no dangerous balconies visible, making it relatively baby-safe, though the hard tile floors throughout would benefit from play mats. Spacious at 39 ping with good natural light from large windows; the listing description is minimal (just a promotional blurb) but the unit itself looks move-in ready and well-maintained."}
