{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District", "notes": "Clean, renovated apartment with modern tile floors, wall-mounted TV, frosted glass sliding doors, and built-in wood cabinetry. At least two bedrooms are visible - one with built-in wardrobes and a vanity desk, another smaller room with a white metal bed frame. Baby safety concerns include the glass-topped metal coffee table with sharp corners and exposed metal frame, and the glass sliding doors; natural light appears limited as no windows are visible in most shots. The listing description is minimal (agent placeholder text only), which is a minor red flag, but the apartment itself appears well-maintained and spacious at 26 ping for the Da'an district location."}
