{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Da'an District, near Xinyi Road area, Taipei 101 visible from window, possibly near former military compound/Si Si Nan Cun area", "notes": "Older residential building (likely 1980s-90s) with commercial shops at ground level including a pharmacy and I CARE store. The building exterior shows aged concrete facade typical of older Taiwan apartment blocks. Views from 7F show Taipei 101 and what appears to be a former military village or government compound with red-roofed buildings below. No interior photos were provided so condition, baby safety features, and cleanliness cannot be assessed — this is a significant red flag as the listing only shows exterior and view photos. At 27 ping for NT$45,000 in Da'an this is reasonably priced, but the lack of interior images and minimal description (just an agent advertisement) suggests this may be an agent bait listing rather than a genuine offer."}
