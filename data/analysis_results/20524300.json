{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Songshan District", "notes": "Spacious older-style apartment (34 ping) with ornate ceiling moldings, crystal chandelier, and marble-look floors in the living area; the kitchen has dated cabinets and appliances but is functional, and bedrooms have wood flooring with decent natural light through barred windows. The raised platform/step in the master bedroom and second bedroom could be a tripping hazard for a crawling baby, and the window bars throughout suggest no balcony fall risk but the kitchen appears to have a rear service door/balcony area to check. Overall clean and well-maintained for its age, listed through Elegant Realty (expat-focused agent), but fixtures and finishes are distinctly 1990s-era rather than modern."}
