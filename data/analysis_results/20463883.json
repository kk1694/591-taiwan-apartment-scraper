{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Recently renovated unfurnished apartment in excellent condition with light wood laminate flooring, recessed LED lighting, central AC, and clean white walls throughout. The space is very spacious at 45 ping with multiple rooms, and the lack of sharp corners or stairs makes it relatively baby-safe, though the unit is completely empty and will need all furnishings. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agent), the 2F location on a 9-story building likely has an elevator but this is unconfirmed; the venetian blinds on large windows suggest decent natural light potential, but photos were taken at night so actual daylight is unclear."}
