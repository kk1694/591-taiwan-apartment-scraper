{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Modern apartment with recessed lighting, central AC, and built-in cabinetry throughout. The space appears well-maintained but currently cluttered with moving boxes. Baby safety concerns include the raised tatami platform in the second bedroom which could pose a fall risk, and the glass shower enclosure in the bathroom. Natural light is limited in some rooms due to blinds, and the 1st floor location may reduce sunlight overall."}
