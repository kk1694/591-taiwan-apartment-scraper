{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, well-renovated loft-style apartment with double-height ceilings, clean white/neutral palette, smart toilet, glass backsplash kitchen, and quality furnishings. The loft/mezzanine level visible above the living area has a glass railing which is a significant baby safety concern — a toddler could potentially climb or fall from the upper level. The apartment appears very clean with good natural light from a balcony, but the compact kitchen and open loft stairs would need baby-proofing. At 8F/13F the building almost certainly has an elevator."}
