{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Nangang, near MRT City Hall (中信房屋捷運市府店 agency)", "notes": "Beautifully renovated modern apartment with high-end finishes including light wood flooring, recessed LED lighting, ceiling-mounted AC, smart home panel, glass-enclosed shower, and designer cabinetry. The space appears very clean and well-maintained with rounded wall corners in the dining area which is good for baby safety. The 22-floor building on 2F strongly suggests elevator access. Large windows provide good natural light potential, though no balcony is visible in photos which is actually safer for a baby. No major red flags; this is a premium unit in excellent condition."}
