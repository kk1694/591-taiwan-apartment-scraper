{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, recently renovated apartment with clean white walls, recessed lighting, and light wood flooring throughout. The space is unfurnished and appears immaculate. For baby safety: the balcony has low railings that would need child-proofing; no stairs visible. Good natural light from multiple windows with blinds and sliding glass doors to balconies."}
