{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, high-end duplex apartment with marble accent wall, built-in shelving, central AC, polished tile floors in living area and hardwood in bedrooms. The internal staircase is a significant baby safety concern as it has open wooden steps with no visible gate or railing enclosure. Large floor-to-ceiling windows provide excellent natural light but balcony railings visible from outside appear to have wide gaps. The unit is spacious (48.84 ping) and in pristine condition with a modern open kitchen, but the duplex layout with stairs will require baby-proofing investment."}
