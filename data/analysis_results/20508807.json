{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Spacious, well-maintained apartment with modern recessed LED lighting, polished tile floors, and a contemporary kitchen with granite countertops and range hood. Good natural light from large windows. For baby safety, the unit is unfurnished with no visible stairs or sharp corners, though low balcony railings visible in one bedroom may need childproofing later. An 11-floor building on 2F strongly suggests elevator access."}
