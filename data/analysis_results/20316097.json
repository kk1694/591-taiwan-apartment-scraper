{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xinyi District", "notes": "Modern, well-furnished apartment with designer Togo-style leather sofas, glass coffee tables, recessed lighting, and a chandelier. The living area is spacious with wood-look laminate flooring, and the bedroom has built-in wardrobes and an en-suite bathroom visible through the doorway. Baby safety concerns include the glass coffee tables with sharp edges and the large floor-standing mirror in the bedroom that could tip; the AC units appear to be older wall-mounted models despite the otherwise modern interior. The description is minimal (just a generic agent promo), providing no useful details about the property itself, which is a minor red flag — but the images show a clean, well-maintained unit on the 9th floor of a 13-story building, very likely with elevator access."}
