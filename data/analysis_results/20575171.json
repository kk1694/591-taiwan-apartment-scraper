{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Zhongzheng District, near MRT station (visible in image 1 with entrance number 5)", "notes": "This is an older but well-maintained apartment with classic parquet wood flooring, built-in white TV cabinet, and a traditional separate kitchen with gas stove and range hood. The unit shows its age with dated tile work, older-style fixtures, and worn balcony areas. Baby safety concerns include the front balcony with decorative iron railings that have wide gaps a child could reach through, the rear utility balcony with horizontal bar railings that are climbable, and glass shelving near the TV unit with sharp edges. Natural light appears moderate from the balconies. The listing description is essentially empty (just an agent ad), which is a red flag — the 27.5 ping size is spacious for the price but the lack of detail suggests this may be an agent bait listing."}
