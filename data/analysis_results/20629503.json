{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern and well-maintained apartment with sleek polished tile floors, recessed LED ceiling lighting, contemporary furnishings, and a clean white kitchen with gas stove and modern cabinetry. The spacious 64-ping layout offers good natural light through large floor-to-ceiling windows with sheer curtains. For baby safety, the polished tile floors are very slippery, the glass coffee table has sharp corners, and the large floor-to-ceiling windows/possible balcony access would need childproofing; however the open floor plan and lack of visible stairs are positives."}
