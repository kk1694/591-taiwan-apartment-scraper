{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Neihu District", "notes": "Very modern, high-end unfurnished apartment with recessed LED ceiling lighting, polished tile floors, and a luxurious bathroom featuring marble countertop, bathtub, and glass shower partition. Listed through Elegant Realty (expat housing agency), the unit is spacious at 49 ping with multiple rooms and appears to be in excellent, nearly new condition. For baby safety, the smooth tile floors are slippery and would need rugs, the glass shower door and sharp marble bathroom edges are concerns, but the flat single-level layout with no stairs is a plus; the unit comes unfurnished so you can choose baby-safe furniture. Natural light appears decent from the large curtained windows, though no balcony is visible in the photos which is actually safer for a baby."}
