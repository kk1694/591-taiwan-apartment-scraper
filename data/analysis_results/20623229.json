{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment in fair condition with white tile floors throughout and dated fixtures. The unit is spacious at 37 ping with multiple bedrooms, built-in wooden wardrobes, an en-suite bathroom with bathtub, and split AC units. However, the overall style is dated with an old window-unit AC in the living room, older-style wooden doors, and some wall discoloration along baseboards. For baby safety, the bathtub would need a cover or gate, and the sliding glass balcony door in the living room should be secured; the tile floors are hard and slippery. Natural light appears limited, with small windows in bedrooms and the main light coming from the balcony-side sliding doors in the living area."}
