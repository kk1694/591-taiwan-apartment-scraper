{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Newly renovated apartment with modern minimalist design, light wood laminate flooring, new kitchen with black fixtures, L-shaped leather sofa, and good natural light from large windows. The listing includes utilities (water/electricity), internet, package receiving, and trash collection. The unit appears to be a loft/duplex style (photo 3 is taken from an upper level looking down), which is a significant baby safety concern due to internal stairs and the open mezzanine railing; the half-wall railing visible in photo 5 would also need childproofing. Overall very clean and well-maintained, but the duplex layout with stairs makes it less ideal for a family with a baby."}
