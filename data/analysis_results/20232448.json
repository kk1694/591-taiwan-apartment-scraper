{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very spacious, recently renovated unfurnished apartment with glossy white tile floors, modern open kitchen with gas stove and upper cabinets, recessed lighting, and large windows providing good natural light. At 55.7 ping on the 8th floor of a 15-story building (very likely has elevator), this is a clean blank-slate unit ideal for a family; the smooth floors and open layout are baby-friendly, though the hard tile and dark baseboard corners may need padding, and window safety locks should be verified. Listed through Dingli Rental Service; the description is minimal (just an agent ad), so bedroom count and bathroom details are unknown — an in-person visit is recommended."}
