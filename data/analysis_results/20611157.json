{"is_modern": "N", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Older apartment with dated furniture and fixtures. The living room has marble floors and covered furniture, while bedrooms have mixed flooring. Windows have security bars which are good for baby safety, but the bunk bed in one room and glass coffee table pose concerns. Good natural light with mountain views, reasonably clean but window AC units suggest older building systems."}
