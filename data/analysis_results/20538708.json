{"is_modern": "?", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": "Xingshan Road Lane 281, Neihu District (Lisong Garden community, Neihu Phase 5 area)", "notes": "Spacious 2BR/1BA furnished apartment in a 9-story elevator building with parking included. Well-equipped with appliances, furniture, sofa, AC, and natural gas — described as 90% move-in ready with good natural light and rectangular layout. For a couple with a baby: the single balcony should be checked for railing safety and gaps; only one bathroom may be a constraint; the building is in a family-friendly area near schools and Carrefour. No pets allowed, and the landlord is abroad long-term so maintenance responsiveness could be a concern."}
