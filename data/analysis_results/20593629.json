{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern, newly renovated apartment in excellent condition with sleek LED lighting, polished tile floors, modern kitchen with glass partition, and split AC units. The spacious living room has floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors to a balcony with metal railings that appear adequate but should be checked in person for baby safety; the balcony doors would need child locks. The flat layout with no stairs is ideal for a family with a baby, and the unit is very clean with good natural light from large windows on a high floor (10F). At 40 ping this is generously sized for a couple with a baby. Note: the description is minimal (just an agent promotion), so details about lease terms and included amenities should be confirmed directly."}
