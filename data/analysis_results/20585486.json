{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "?", "is_flat": "N", "location": null, "notes": "This appears to be a commercial/retail space rather than a residential apartment - features include open floor plan with industrial strip lighting, raised access flooring typical of retail, display shelving, and a large central island counter. Major baby safety concerns: internal staircase with glass railings that have wide gaps, open floor panels, and multi-level layout with mezzanine. The space looks newly renovated with modern finishes but is unsuitable for residential use with a baby."}
