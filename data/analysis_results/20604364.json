{"is_modern": "Y", "has_elevator": "Y", "is_flat": "Y", "location": null, "notes": "Very modern and well-maintained apartment with high-end finishes including recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry, and contemporary furniture. The unit is very clean with excellent natural light in the bedroom. For baby safety, the coffee table has sharp glass corners and the balcony visible in image 4 has standard railings that would need childproofing; the floor-to-ceiling mirrors could also pose risks as baby grows mobile."}
